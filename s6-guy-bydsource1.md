## Introduction 

The Origin's Creation of Twelve Source Entities If you have read The History of God,a story of the beginning of everything,which gave the reader an insight into how I started my higher level communications and managed to communicate with spiritual/energetic entities whilst gaining insights into the wonders that are all around us and the truth about our legends and myths,then you will remember that there were twelve Source Entities created by the Origin.The first one being discussed in some limited detail in the book above was our very own Source Entity (SE),whom we refer to as God,the being that created our universe.In reality the Origin should really be considered as God as it created the Source Entities,but I think that the Origin is well beyond the need for this sort of primitive nomenclature,which is only necessary for us humans in our low level of physically trapped conscious existence. It was during the countless days editing and compiling the channeled texts for the book above that I realized that in order to keep the records straight,I would need to set up communications with each of these other entities in turn in order to gain a basic understanding of the details of the work that they have done in their own environments, which I expected to differ from one another. As a result of the potential level of difference,I was held in a certain level of trepidation.For instance,would I be able to understand what was being channeled through me?And would it be in a format that could be understood by those who wish to learn the knowledge that could well be totally over all of our heads?Upon reflection,I decided that I had been "here" before and should not try to predict what would come. Welcome back!

## Chapter 1 - Source Entity One- The Master of Our Multiverse 

[For those who haven't read The History of God:a story of the beginning of everything,SE is Source Entity,and ME is Guy Needler,the author of this book.] SE:Well,that was a rather grand entrance you wrote on the first page. ME:I would hardly call it agrand entrance,more of a preamble,a"getting the audience warmed up"for the The Shape of Things to Come. SE:You can quote HG Wells if you want,but we need to get down to the real business of letting your readers know what is happening in the wider areas of the Origin,what my peers are up to,and what they are accomplishing,not writing science fiction.Although what you are about to experience over the next months of communication may get you wondering on these lines. One thing is certain-this is not a task to be taken lightly.Indeed,it is one that you WILL struggle with,specifically with the concepts that some of the Source Entities will present to you.It is with this thought about your struggling that I offer you this opportunity for help. Before we delve into the old ground of my creation,some of which I have no doubt you will cut and paste from the other texts and some of which will be new information,I suggest that I act as your guide,mentor,and main point of contact when establishing contact and ultimately communicating with the other Source Entities,especially as you will need to meet them in their own environments.Therefore,I will be your passport to the other Source environments whilst delivering this book. ME:Why do I need your help-not that I am refusing it?I can communicate with the Origin all on my own,so why not them? SE:They are not as capable of understanding the entities that are created outside their environments as the Origin and I are.The Origin is the source of everything;I am the Source of you and your environment,so we both have no problem tuning in to your frequencies and level of communication whilst in the physical.Some of the Sources don't go anywhere nearly as low as ten frequency levels above you-let alone down to your level-so they are bound to have problems communicating with you directly,hence my insistence in offering help in this matter. ME:Thank you.Now I understand.I feel quite excited about meeting these other Source Entities. SE:And so you should,for you go where no man has gone before. ME:No one! SE:What? ME:No one,Gene Roddenberry's original introductory text was changed to say NO ONE,not NO MAN. SE:One,this is no time for Star Trek jokes and two,you are not NO ONE.You are a man, currently,and NO MAN to date has done what you are about to do.

ME:Touche. SE:Now let's get on with it.Let's get down to the nitty gritty. The Source Entity Becomes Aware of Its Self and Its Environment ME:I guess at this point I will be doing some copying from the first book? SE:Only where it is relevant.There will be some correlation,but don't forget that in the first set of dialogues I was talking about what we(the twelve Source Entities)were doing collectively and not individually.There is no point in going over old ground,such as how I/ we developed the physical side of the human race,for that would not be good value in terms of reading time and text space.However,I will reiterate what is essential and,therefore, needs to be fleshed out more. ME:O.K.,let's start from the beginning then and deal with the "detail"as we get to it.What happened at the start ofyour existence? SE:In the beginning it was like I was part of the Origin but still the Origin-not as I am now.It was like I was one thought of what was going on in the Origin's consciousness-one thought that was given substance,time to be,individual space to move around in,but still a thought nevertheless.I knew I was the Origin and was separate from the Origin all at the same time.It was as if my individual awareness was like a memory that is in the front of your mind for a moment,and then is gone,only to reappear later when you give it enough attention or when you are not trying too hard to remember.It's just like when you remember a memory that you hold in your mind fleetingly but then lose,resulting in a struggle to recover the memory.It is this enhanced attention to the fleeting awareness that I had lost that later gave rise to the ability to hold the level of awareness for long enough to bring it into the consciousness state again.At first it was hard,and I have no doubt that many,many millennia passed before I had reached full independent consciousness. ME:So what was the defining moment of consciousness for you?When did you realize that you were truly individual but were still part of a bigger entity,the Origin? SE:Actually,it was not so much of a defining moment,more like a defining conversation. ME:A conversation?You mean you were told by the Origin you were an individual entity? SE:In a nutshell,yes.We all were,but this conversation only took place when each of us had achieved a critical level of awareness and,therefore,consciousness.As I stated in the first dialogue we had,one of us is still in this "dawning"state of awareness.You will experience this when we need to enter its environment. You see,the Origin was watching our development at all times and chose the moment for communication and education when it knew it would be at its most effective. ME:The Origin educated you as well? SE:Only to the point of what I was brought into existence for and what the rules of being in existence were.Some of these I have passed on to all of you,for they are relevant to all entities that are "of the Origin." ME:Let's go back to that moment of defining moment of consciousness. SE:The moment was just before the Origin contacted me to advise me on why I was created.I had noticed that I was aware of my own "self"almost continuously and could remember what I needed to do to maintain consciousness.I could also remember what I had done before although I had not yet understood that I could access what I would do next.In essence,I only knew the past and the present;I could not access the future.In some respects I was just like you are in your incarnate state right now.Another defining moment before the Origin contacted me was the recognition of other entities,eleven of them,all in a similar level of conscious awareness as me.Of course,some were more aware, others were less aware,but on average we were much the same.The clincher here was the ability to communicate with the other Source Entities,which to all intent and purposes,just happened. ME:What?!You all developed a common language all at the same time? SE:No,no.We contacted each other energetically-each of us understanding the other without the need to learn a language.I was later to learn from the Origin that basic energetic communication was one of the things that had been given to us during our creation.This communication medium being based upon the Origin's thought process. ME:So what did the Origin say to you? SE:First,the Origin spoke to each of us individually,not all at once,for we were not all ready to be advised on our roles.Second,each of us had to have established enough awareness and consciousness to be able to realize and understand that we were part of a larger-much larger-entity and that we were parts of this much larger entity given individuality. ME:How did you understand that you were part of the Origin? SE:Simply by noticing that I could hear the thoughts of the Origin.These thoughts were the thoughts of an entity in deep contemplation. ME:Not by traveling to the edge of the Origin's boundary? SE:The Origin has no boundary as you know it,so this would not have provided the evidence for being a component of the Origin.Once I established that the thoughts were not coming from the others-the other eleven Source Entities-I drew the conclusion that I must be part of something bigger.I reached out in communication to the Origin,and it responded.From that point onward,I was in constant communication with the Origin,learning the reasons for my existence and what task I had to undertake to explore the self and the Origin and improve my awareness-in essence,evolve. ME:Did you have any choice in the matter of the task at hand? SE:There was no choice for the task was the very reason for my existence. ME:What rules did you have? SE:None. ME:What time frame do you have to work to? SE:None. The only remit was to explore,learn,become more aware,and evolve.In doing so,the Origin said that it would also evolve,and it would do this by experiencing all that I experienced at that same time as I experienced it.It said that it was doing this many times all at the same time,for its thirst for expanding its own awareness of self was insatiable. ME:And it's still doing it now?

SE:Yes,it's still doing it now after many,many billions of years.This is the only way I can relay to you the amount of attention it has dedicated to the subject of knowing itself better, becoming more aware,and evolving. ME:Let's get back to the subject of you becoming aware.I can relate to becoming aware from the point of view of a child,as I once was. SE:As you have been many times. ME:Yes,but I never realized that I was aware of self until I was-I have to think hard about at what point this occurred-sometime in the early pre-teenage years.And this was only because of being ridiculed at schoolfor having such way-out ideas,ones which I now realize were manifested from my ability to tap into the higher frequencies and,therefore,the greater reality-which now allows me to communicate with you and the Origin and other entities,such as Byron. When I was a child,I just was me.I had no real feeling of individual awareness.I just did what children do but with no realization of self although I was aware that I was different somehow,apart from the others.This was a feeling that I found was quite strange,for I always thought that I was part of something important.As a result,I always found it hard to be "part of the gang,"so to speak,and they considered me as a bit strange. So you realized that you were you at the point just before the Origin communicated with you and a little after the time you noticed that there where eleven others? SE:Yes,I became aware that I was able to experience different things by changing the location of myself.By location I do not mean spatial as you are thinking but both dimensional and frequential.When I moved myself into different "locations,"I experienced different things happening to my energies,my "self."These were predominantly sensations on many levels-many more levels than you can possibly imagine.It was during one of these sensation experiencing moments that I recognized my "self"as being individual.I was fully aware of cause and effect.If I did one thing,something else would happen.If I did something different,then this was rewarded with a different effect. The awareness of self is the most important milestone on any entity's road to evolution. Further,the awareness of awareness is the milestone in an entity's road to evolution where the veil of illusion is lifted to reveal the true reality of existence.This is the point where everything is made clear.Nothing is misunderstood.There is no environmental limitation, there is no limitation in understanding,there is no limitation in capacity for learning,and, therefore,no limitation in the ability to evolve.There is only opportunity. ME:So apart from the feeling of cause and effect,what else gave you the nudge you needed to become aware? SE:Nothing else,only the experience of cause and effect and the recognition of the other eleven Source Entities.Although at this point,none of us recognized what we were fully capable of as we were not yet in receipt of our instructions from the Origin.Let me say here though that the element of cause and effect as a factor of recognizing self-awareness should not be played down,for it is the recognition of an individual's ability to create that is the deciding factor.Cause creates effect,and to cause an effect that is the manifestation of pure creativity is to create the feeling of satisfaction;with satisfaction comes recognition of self and awareness of self in the environment of existence.

ME:So what you are saying is that you really got to grips with recognizing your "self"when you were creating. SE:Eloquently put.Creativity is one of the most important things that an entity can do;it is a reflection of self and is,therefore,the doorway to self-realization,awareness.Many of your artists,engineers,scientists,and authors create,and it is with their creations that they realize who and what they are-their creations are an extension of their "selves"with their creations,therefore,acting as mirrors,making recognition easier. ME:I get the feeling that pride has a hand in this as well. SE:To some extent,but pride is only a feeling of well-being,of ego.However,as ego is the prerequisite for the state of "I am,"it also helps in being one of the markers on the road to awareness. Creativity is the ultimate marker.It is the result of action on behalf of the individual.It is the debris left behind to indicate existence,and it is the evidence needed by the individual entity to make the jump from mere existence to the realization of existence.It was,therefore,when I created different things by manipulating and changing the natural representation of the energy surrounding me that I made the connection between mere existence and realization of self. ME:If I remember correctly,then this must have been around the time that you were creating myriad patterns and shapes-what we now recognize as galaxies and planets. SE:Well remembered,but not correct as the galaxies and planets were not that which currently exist in your universal environment.

ME:You mean that you wiped them out?You started again? SE:Yes,it was merely a game.Nothing was lost,and everything was gained.My awareness was gained.Don't forget that creativity is a reflection of self,and in this instance,the shapes and patterns caused me to reflect inwardly and recognize achievement.As previously stated, the achievement of creativity is a reflection of self creating recognition of self and,therefore, granting the individual entity the gift of awareness.I subsequently became aware and was contacted by the Origin moments later,which further confirmed my awareness. ME:So would you completely wipe out the universes that you have currently,the ones that humanity and the rest of your entities exist within? SE:I could and I might at some point in the future,but one thing that I will not do is remove the energy-based entities that I have created.These would stay and populate the new environment.Actually,I see no need to recreate a new environment,as there is much to gain from the current one. 

ME:Why would you keep the entities from this set of universes if you decided to start again and not wipe them out as well? 

SE:Simple.The reason for keeping the entities that I have created in this universe is because they are part of me,and I am part of them.If I consolidated back into oneness all that I have created and given individuality to,I would lose myriad opportunities to experience the vast number of experiences in the multipolous [multiple of multiple of multiple]ways that I am now.Moreover,I would lose the continued level of evolutionary experience.Experience and evolution takes time to accomplish as does the ability to understand how to evolve in the most effective way.All this would be lost and have to be re-learnt by the new entities that I would need to create.No,I see no need to do this;it would not be beneficial to me as it would ultimately slow down my speed of evolution. 

### Creation of the Universes 

ME:We have discussed your awakening and awareness of your "self"in brief and the fact that you became more aware of self when the Origin communicated to you and the other Source Entities it created. 

SE:Yes,we have. ME:I would like to know more about what the Origin said to you all and what made you decide on the format of entities and multiversal environment you chose. 

SE:As I said in our previous dialogues,the other Source Entities and I were having a whale of a time.We were allowed to do anything we wanted. ME:Was this your own choice? SE:No.The first thing that the Origin said to us when we were aware of each other and the Origin was that we had to learn the art of experience-literally,how to experience and learn/ evolve from those experiences.The time in between our being aware of "self,each other, and the Origin was next to no time at all.It was almost instantaneous from my perspective, but you may think that millennia had gone by if you had to measure the time in human terms.At this point the Origin made us aware of its intentions for us and educated us on the reasons for our existence and the task that it was going to set us-all of which would result in the Origin's accelerated evolution and experience of its "self." The first thing we had to do was just create.We were told to create and experience anything and everything in any way we felt we would benefit by,simply by experiencing what we had created.This was primarily energetic at first but ultimately deviated into the frequential and dimensional aspects of creativity. ME:How do you mean? SE:Well,I think I had better focus on my own experience now as I am aware that I could start to explain what we were all experiencing rather than just myself.This will come out separately with each of the dialogues we have with the other Source Entities. ME:That's fine by me. SE:Let us continue then.Once I had experienced creativity from the energetic aspect in a general environmental sense,i.e.,who and where I was,I started to realize that the same level of creativity was not represented in the same way the higher up or lower down the frequencies.This changed significantly as I introduced the dimensional aspect to the object or item that I was creating.I noticed that if I created something in my current general environment,the representation in the higher and lower frequencies/dimensions was not the same.In fact,the change was quite marked. ME:Give me an example. SE:Let me take something that you would relate to as an example then,galaxies.When I created something that had singularity and was manifest into a lower frequency,it gained form.The lower down the frequencies I went,the more substantial the form was.When I went up the frequencies,the more insubstantial the form was and the more,for the want of a better word,fluidic it became. ME:You mean it became a fluid? SE:No,it is a figure of speech.By fluidic I mean that it was more without form.What's more it was able to interject in between the dimensions the higher up the frequencies it was.For example,it was so formless it had the ability to exist in any environment.Similarly, the lower down the frequencies,the more form the creation had and the less able it was to interject between the dimensions and lower frequencies.In fact,it ended up being locked into one set of frequencies and a corresponding dimension as well.The "formless"was purely energetic;the"formed"became nebulae in some of the higher frequencies,suns in the lower frequencies,and planets in the lowest frequencies.What was interesting is that what you call galaxies are not specifically"form"as the level of form is local to the frequencies that the "formed"naturally migrated to or were attracted to.This meant that as I created things that had form,they were either more or less in substance and had more or less form due to the pockets of higher or lower frequencies,i.e.,what I created was not pure of frequency or dimension.This explains why galaxies are what they are-vast areas of space with local areas of density-the local areas of density correlating to the lower frequencies,therefore, creating "form."That which was "formed"resulted in the round objects you call suns and planets. I found this fascinating and was entirely motivated into understanding that part that I had created that was form rather than formless.Hence,the universe you have today. ME:So you messed around with energy to create what we now recognize as galaxies.

SE:That's about the size of it. ME:So when did you decide to stop with the set of galaxies that we have today,bearing in mind that we also now recognize that there are myriad universes as well,each having its own set of galaxies?So here's a second question as well.When did you decide to stop with the set of universes that we have today? SE:Essentially when I realized that I was re-creating for the sake of it,I realized that I was not giving the creations that I had made enough time to mature and become something on their own.Everything that I had created was being manipulated by me just to see what it would look like.I had not recognized the possibility of extended creation through observation of form changing on its own as a result of its own inertia. ME:What does extended creation mean? SE:It means the creation of new creativity by that that has been created.In essence,that is what you,mankind,are doing now. Creation being created by that which was created-this was truly fascinating.Why I stopped re-creating the galaxies,which by the way are a function of creating universes,was because I realized that the level of creation resulting from me doing nothing but observing, observing that which I had created,was something significantly more interesting than I had even considered as a possibility.It was fun,but more importantly,it was a window into a new dimension of evolution for me.The universes were the environment from which the creation of physical form,the galaxies,suns and planets would ultimately take on their own dynamics.I,therefore,stopped the creation,re-creation cycle when I saw a pattern of creativity emerge that I thought had the most potential,i.e.,one that would bear the most fruit with the minimum of interaction. ME:So how did you create the universes? SE:The big bang theory that your scientists propose as the start of the universe is so far away from the truth it is not even worth considering.I didn't create the universes by igniting a gigantic match and it exploding and expanding,although it does sound like a good idea.No, I created the universes by simply giving the area within myself that energy that I wanted to be a universe,intention and purpose-the purpose being to become what it wanted to be, what it felt was the best form it should undertake in all the frequencies and dimensions that it eventually settled on being.This resulted in the areas that eventually became physical in form moving away from each other to give themselves space,the space to not be influenced by each other in any significant way. ME:Are you suggesting that the galaxies and the universes have sentience,intelligence? SE:I am not suggesting it;they ARE sentient,they ARE intelligent,but they are not intellectual-they simply exist.In essence,the universes and the resulting galaxies are living entities in their own rights.Each universe that I created,twelve of them,have the power to manipulate themselves into the condition they feel best suits their own personal taste-the galaxies being the physical representation of what the universes have created within themselves. ME:Ijust got an image/suggestion that the galaxies are similar to cells within our human bodies. SE:That is not a bad description,for they are the more solid part of the universe's form,as it were,and they do have a function to perform within the structure of the universe.But to say that they were the cells of a larger form would be wrong,for the function that they have to perform is not the result of bodily function or the function of an organ within a larger body.Their function is to collect that energy that is close in frequency or dimension to the physical and give it form.In doing so,they clear all of the stray energies that are within their universe,the energies resulting from their initial manifestation or creation. In essence,the objective of each of the galaxies is the grouping together of all of these energies into energy groups and giving them a purpose relative to the strengths and properties of their collective frequencies and energetic content.A good example of this can be seen in the physical bodies within what you call the solar system,the planets.Each of the planets is a grouping together of similar energies with each of the energies having a similar range of frequencies that manifest in a similar way in the lower dimensions-the similarity being enough to allow them to bind together.The result of such energies being similar but not quite the same is what you see in your periodic table.The earth is a classic example of this.It appears to be a solid lump in space made from the same material,but when you look deeper,you see that it is made up from a whole host of different materials that are only separated by frequency or a number of electrons.Sometimes only one frequency or electron will separate two different materials from each other when we synthesize them.Jupiter, on the other hand,is a classic example of a body that is a collection of higher frequency energies,the materials of which are gaseous in frequential representation in this dimension.

ME:I havejust gained a vision of a house made from bricks of different sizes,some being standard size,others being half size or double size-all of them being assembled together in a way that allows the house to be built and appear to be a single unit. SE:That is an excellent example and that is exactly what the galaxies are doing with the stray energies. ME:Is it fair to assume that at some point the galaxies were very small in comparison to what they are now? SE:Yes and no.Some of them started out at the large size they are now-their job being to collect the more subtle higher frequency energies.The smaller ones are more adept at gathering up the denser energies. ME:Like a black hole? SE:A black hole is,in fact,a small,very small galaxy.To do the job it has to do,it needs to be able to gather together energies that are right at the bottom of the frequencies of the dimensions they are working with.Hence,they have a lot of mass in comparison to their relative physical representation. ME:So this explains why the galaxies all have different shapes. SE:Yes,the shapes being relative to the energies they work with and the content of the energies they have managed to attract. In fact,some of the energies they work with are so difficult to work with that they have to create constructs to aid collection specific to the energy type they are working with.

ME:You mean like a machine? SE:No.This is an energetic construct;it is not physical at all.In fact,some of the constructs are so subtle they cannot be truly classified as a construct. ME:So what are they then if they are not whole enough to be classified as a construct? SE:They are more of an intention.Let me explain.Energies sometimes cannot be manipulated by physical or energetic means either alone or in total.This is because of the personality of the energy,for want of a better word.When the energy that is to be worked with does not respond to manipulation or transmutation,it means that the energy has personality.This means that the energy has a purpose of its own and will resist all changes that are intended to deviate it from this purpose.Thus,the energy needs to be persuaded to change the purpose of its existence to one that also includes the desire of the galactic entity. In doing this,it has to work with the energy for a long enough time for it to get used to the other energy that surrounds it or is close by to it.In essence,it needs to think of the galactic entity as part of it,even though it is not.The galactic entity,therefore,needs to manipulate its own base energy frequency and intention to one that is close enough to the signature energy of the energy to be attracted to allow it to be worked with whilst retaining enough of its own individuality to retain its own personality and beingness.Once the energy is "fooled" into thinking the galaxy is part of it,it is happy to have its intention changed to that of the galactic entity,provided that the galactic entity makes the changes to the intention in a subtle way that cannot be detected as an invasive energy. ME:So the galaxy,which is sort of an entity in its own right,has to fool the energy to be gathered that it is part of it and then re-program its intention/direction.

SE:That's it.Although it is a really basic thing to talk about,in actuality,it can take many millennia to complete.This is why some galaxies appear to be big dust clouds with just a handful or,indeed,no material at all that is dense enough to call a star or,indeed,a planet. Hence some of the beautiful images that your Hubble space telescope has taken since its placement in earth orbit. 

### The Function of the Galaxies 

ME:So what other jobs do galaxies do other than collect stray energies? SE:They provide refuge for entities that have sought to be associated with the energies that have coalesced into the physical frequencies or those that might provide opportunity for higher entities'experience and evolution. ME:Hold on a bit.Are you suggesting that galactic entities,"galaxies,"are fairly low down in the pecking order,entity-wise? SE:They are what they are.They are neither higher nor lower than other entities within my creativity.In essence,they are no different from you than I am from you.The only real difference is that they are of the group of entities that did not benefit as much as you and others like you did when I created you.In some respects,they are more important than you as they provide the opportunity for your growth and evolution,but in terms in their ability to experience,they are not nearly as nimble as you smaller,more agile entities. ME:So tell me more about what you meant by the galaxies providing refuge for the more agile entities. SE:The word "refuge"is a term of reference.It means place of security or place to live/exist.In essence,it is where the smaller,more compact and more agile/evolved entities can experience what they want to achieve to continue their evolutionary progression.This is where the galactic entities come into their own.Let me explain. Their primary role is to gather stray energy and give it purpose.That purpose is to provide substance,substance for the evolution of the individualized entities.In doing this,they also progress evolution-wise-this progression being the result of their being of service to the individualized entities.In doing this,they help in progressing the bigger picture by helping the Origin to understand itself more and,in turn,evolve. ME:So the galactic entities are part of the plan as well? SE:Yes.Every entity I have created is both part of the plan and has a role to play within the plan.In performing their roles,they also progress and evolve. Listen,the whole reason for all of our existence is to evolve-no question in that.Everyone, everything,every entity has a role to play in this,and we are enthusiastic in this role.In your exalted position of a free-thinking individualized entity,you are placed in a unique position to both assist in this goal and to accelerate it.But let me get back to the main answer to your question.The refuge given to you and the rest of the entities endowed with individuality is to provide the necessary theater for you to experience the things that you believe will result in your evolving in some(small)way.In your instance,this is by providing a physical location where you can experience a lower-much,much lower-level of existence than you would normally experience in your energetic state.
