## Introduction 

The Origin's Creation of Twelve Source Entities If you have read The History of God,a story of the beginning of everything,which gave the reader an insight into how I started my higher level communications and managed to communicate with spiritual/energetic entities whilst gaining insights into the wonders that are all around us and the truth about our legends and myths,then you will remember that there were twelve Source Entities created by the Origin.The first one being discussed in some limited detail in the book above was our very own Source Entity (SE),whom we refer to as God,the being that created our universe.In reality the Origin should really be considered as God as it created the Source Entities,but I think that the Origin is well beyond the need for this sort of primitive nomenclature,which is only necessary for us humans in our low level of physically trapped conscious existence. It was during the countless days editing and compiling the channeled texts for the book above that I realized that in order to keep the records straight,I would need to set up communications with each of these other entities in turn in order to gain a basic understanding of the details of the work that they have done in their own environments, which I expected to differ from one another. As a result of the potential level of difference,I was held in a certain level of trepidation.For instance,would I be able to understand what was being channeled through me?And would it be in a format that could be understood by those who wish to learn the knowledge that could well be totally over all of our heads?Upon reflection,I decided that I had been "here" before and should not try to predict what would come. Welcome back!

## Chapter 1 - Source Entity One- The Master of Our Multiverse 

[For those who haven't read The History of God:a story of the beginning of everything,SE is Source Entity,and ME is Guy Needler,the author of this book.] SE:Well,that was a rather grand entrance you wrote on the first page. ME:I would hardly call it agrand entrance,more of a preamble,a"getting the audience warmed up"for the The Shape of Things to Come. SE:You can quote HG Wells if you want,but we need to get down to the real business of letting your readers know what is happening in the wider areas of the Origin,what my peers are up to,and what they are accomplishing,not writing science fiction.Although what you are about to experience over the next months of communication may get you wondering on these lines. One thing is certain-this is not a task to be taken lightly.Indeed,it is one that you WILL struggle with,specifically with the concepts that some of the Source Entities will present to you.It is with this thought about your struggling that I offer you this opportunity for help. Before we delve into the old ground of my creation,some of which I have no doubt you will cut and paste from the other texts and some of which will be new information,I suggest that I act as your guide,mentor,and main point of contact when establishing contact and ultimately communicating with the other Source Entities,especially as you will need to meet them in their own environments.Therefore,I will be your passport to the other Source environments whilst delivering this book. ME:Why do I need your help-not that I am refusing it?I can communicate with the Origin all on my own,so why not them? SE:They are not as capable of understanding the entities that are created outside their environments as the Origin and I are.The Origin is the source of everything;I am the Source of you and your environment,so we both have no problem tuning in to your frequencies and level of communication whilst in the physical.Some of the Sources don't go anywhere nearly as low as ten frequency levels above you-let alone down to your level-so they are bound to have problems communicating with you directly,hence my insistence in offering help in this matter. ME:Thank you.Now I understand.I feel quite excited about meeting these other Source Entities. SE:And so you should,for you go where no man has gone before. ME:No one! SE:What? ME:No one,Gene Roddenberry's original introductory text was changed to say NO ONE,not NO MAN. SE:One,this is no time for Star Trek jokes and two,you are not NO ONE.You are a man, currently,and NO MAN to date has done what you are about to do.

ME:Touche. SE:Now let's get on with it.Let's get down to the nitty gritty. The Source Entity Becomes Aware of Its Self and Its Environment ME:I guess at this point I will be doing some copying from the first book? SE:Only where it is relevant.There will be some correlation,but don't forget that in the first set of dialogues I was talking about what we(the twelve Source Entities)were doing collectively and not individually.There is no point in going over old ground,such as how I/ we developed the physical side of the human race,for that would not be good value in terms of reading time and text space.However,I will reiterate what is essential and,therefore, needs to be fleshed out more. ME:O.K.,let's start from the beginning then and deal with the "detail"as we get to it.What happened at the start ofyour existence? SE:In the beginning it was like I was part of the Origin but still the Origin-not as I am now.It was like I was one thought of what was going on in the Origin's consciousness-one thought that was given substance,time to be,individual space to move around in,but still a thought nevertheless.I knew I was the Origin and was separate from the Origin all at the same time.It was as if my individual awareness was like a memory that is in the front of your mind for a moment,and then is gone,only to reappear later when you give it enough attention or when you are not trying too hard to remember.It's just like when you remember a memory that you hold in your mind fleetingly but then lose,resulting in a struggle to recover the memory.It is this enhanced attention to the fleeting awareness that I had lost that later gave rise to the ability to hold the level of awareness for long enough to bring it into the consciousness state again.At first it was hard,and I have no doubt that many,many millennia passed before I had reached full independent consciousness. ME:So what was the defining moment of consciousness for you?When did you realize that you were truly individual but were still part of a bigger entity,the Origin? SE:Actually,it was not so much of a defining moment,more like a defining conversation. ME:A conversation?You mean you were told by the Origin you were an individual entity? SE:In a nutshell,yes.We all were,but this conversation only took place when each of us had achieved a critical level of awareness and,therefore,consciousness.As I stated in the first dialogue we had,one of us is still in this "dawning"state of awareness.You will experience this when we need to enter its environment. You see,the Origin was watching our development at all times and chose the moment for communication and education when it knew it would be at its most effective. ME:The Origin educated you as well? SE:Only to the point of what I was brought into existence for and what the rules of being in existence were.Some of these I have passed on to all of you,for they are relevant to all entities that are "of the Origin." ME:Let's go back to that moment of defining moment of consciousness. SE:The moment was just before the Origin contacted me to advise me on why I was created.I had noticed that I was aware of my own "self"almost continuously and could remember what I needed to do to maintain consciousness.I could also remember what I had done before although I had not yet understood that I could access what I would do next.In essence,I only knew the past and the present;I could not access the future.In some respects I was just like you are in your incarnate state right now.Another defining moment before the Origin contacted me was the recognition of other entities,eleven of them,all in a similar level of conscious awareness as me.Of course,some were more aware, others were less aware,but on average we were much the same.The clincher here was the ability to communicate with the other Source Entities,which to all intent and purposes,just happened. ME:What?!You all developed a common language all at the same time? SE:No,no.We contacted each other energetically-each of us understanding the other without the need to learn a language.I was later to learn from the Origin that basic energetic communication was one of the things that had been given to us during our creation.This communication medium being based upon the Origin's thought process. ME:So what did the Origin say to you? SE:First,the Origin spoke to each of us individually,not all at once,for we were not all ready to be advised on our roles.Second,each of us had to have established enough awareness and consciousness to be able to realize and understand that we were part of a larger-much larger-entity and that we were parts of this much larger entity given individuality. ME:How did you understand that you were part of the Origin? SE:Simply by noticing that I could hear the thoughts of the Origin.These thoughts were the thoughts of an entity in deep contemplation. ME:Not by traveling to the edge of the Origin's boundary? SE:The Origin has no boundary as you know it,so this would not have provided the evidence for being a component of the Origin.Once I established that the thoughts were not coming from the others-the other eleven Source Entities-I drew the conclusion that I must be part of something bigger.I reached out in communication to the Origin,and it responded.From that point onward,I was in constant communication with the Origin,learning the reasons for my existence and what task I had to undertake to explore the self and the Origin and improve my awareness-in essence,evolve. ME:Did you have any choice in the matter of the task at hand? SE:There was no choice for the task was the very reason for my existence. ME:What rules did you have? SE:None. ME:What time frame do you have to work to? SE:None. The only remit was to explore,learn,become more aware,and evolve.In doing so,the Origin said that it would also evolve,and it would do this by experiencing all that I experienced at that same time as I experienced it.It said that it was doing this many times all at the same time,for its thirst for expanding its own awareness of self was insatiable. ME:And it's still doing it now?

SE:Yes,it's still doing it now after many,many billions of years.This is the only way I can relay to you the amount of attention it has dedicated to the subject of knowing itself better, becoming more aware,and evolving. ME:Let's get back to the subject of you becoming aware.I can relate to becoming aware from the point of view of a child,as I once was. SE:As you have been many times. ME:Yes,but I never realized that I was aware of self until I was-I have to think hard about at what point this occurred-sometime in the early pre-teenage years.And this was only because of being ridiculed at schoolfor having such way-out ideas,ones which I now realize were manifested from my ability to tap into the higher frequencies and,therefore,the greater reality-which now allows me to communicate with you and the Origin and other entities,such as Byron. When I was a child,I just was me.I had no real feeling of individual awareness.I just did what children do but with no realization of self although I was aware that I was different somehow,apart from the others.This was a feeling that I found was quite strange,for I always thought that I was part of something important.As a result,I always found it hard to be "part of the gang,"so to speak,and they considered me as a bit strange. So you realized that you were you at the point just before the Origin communicated with you and a little after the time you noticed that there where eleven others? SE:Yes,I became aware that I was able to experience different things by changing the location of myself.By location I do not mean spatial as you are thinking but both dimensional and frequential.When I moved myself into different "locations,"I experienced different things happening to my energies,my "self."These were predominantly sensations on many levels-many more levels than you can possibly imagine.It was during one of these sensation experiencing moments that I recognized my "self"as being individual.I was fully aware of cause and effect.If I did one thing,something else would happen.If I did something different,then this was rewarded with a different effect. The awareness of self is the most important milestone on any entity's road to evolution. Further,the awareness of awareness is the milestone in an entity's road to evolution where the veil of illusion is lifted to reveal the true reality of existence.This is the point where everything is made clear.Nothing is misunderstood.There is no environmental limitation, there is no limitation in understanding,there is no limitation in capacity for learning,and, therefore,no limitation in the ability to evolve.There is only opportunity. ME:So apart from the feeling of cause and effect,what else gave you the nudge you needed to become aware? SE:Nothing else,only the experience of cause and effect and the recognition of the other eleven Source Entities.Although at this point,none of us recognized what we were fully capable of as we were not yet in receipt of our instructions from the Origin.Let me say here though that the element of cause and effect as a factor of recognizing self-awareness should not be played down,for it is the recognition of an individual's ability to create that is the deciding factor.Cause creates effect,and to cause an effect that is the manifestation of pure creativity is to create the feeling of satisfaction;with satisfaction comes recognition of self and awareness of self in the environment of existence.

ME:So what you are saying is that you really got to grips with recognizing your "self"when you were creating. SE:Eloquently put.Creativity is one of the most important things that an entity can do;it is a reflection of self and is,therefore,the doorway to self-realization,awareness.Many of your artists,engineers,scientists,and authors create,and it is with their creations that they realize who and what they are-their creations are an extension of their "selves"with their creations,therefore,acting as mirrors,making recognition easier. ME:I get the feeling that pride has a hand in this as well. SE:To some extent,but pride is only a feeling of well-being,of ego.However,as ego is the prerequisite for the state of "I am,"it also helps in being one of the markers on the road to awareness. Creativity is the ultimate marker.It is the result of action on behalf of the individual.It is the debris left behind to indicate existence,and it is the evidence needed by the individual entity to make the jump from mere existence to the realization of existence.It was,therefore,when I created different things by manipulating and changing the natural representation of the energy surrounding me that I made the connection between mere existence and realization of self. ME:If I remember correctly,then this must have been around the time that you were creating myriad patterns and shapes-what we now recognize as galaxies and planets. SE:Well remembered,but not correct as the galaxies and planets were not that which currently exist in your universal environment.

ME:You mean that you wiped them out?You started again? SE:Yes,it was merely a game.Nothing was lost,and everything was gained.My awareness was gained.Don't forget that creativity is a reflection of self,and in this instance,the shapes and patterns caused me to reflect inwardly and recognize achievement.As previously stated, the achievement of creativity is a reflection of self creating recognition of self and,therefore, granting the individual entity the gift of awareness.I subsequently became aware and was contacted by the Origin moments later,which further confirmed my awareness. ME:So would you completely wipe out the universes that you have currently,the ones that humanity and the rest of your entities exist within? SE:I could and I might at some point in the future,but one thing that I will not do is remove the energy-based entities that I have created.These would stay and populate the new environment.Actually,I see no need to recreate a new environment,as there is much to gain from the current one. 

ME:Why would you keep the entities from this set of universes if you decided to start again and not wipe them out as well? 

SE:Simple.The reason for keeping the entities that I have created in this universe is because they are part of me,and I am part of them.If I consolidated back into oneness all that I have created and given individuality to,I would lose myriad opportunities to experience the vast number of experiences in the multipolous [multiple of multiple of multiple]ways that I am now.Moreover,I would lose the continued level of evolutionary experience.Experience and evolution takes time to accomplish as does the ability to understand how to evolve in the most effective way.All this would be lost and have to be re-learnt by the new entities that I would need to create.No,I see no need to do this;it would not be beneficial to me as it would ultimately slow down my speed of evolution. 

### Creation of the Universes 

ME:We have discussed your awakening and awareness of your "self"in brief and the fact that you became more aware of self when the Origin communicated to you and the other Source Entities it created. 

SE:Yes,we have. ME:I would like to know more about what the Origin said to you all and what made you decide on the format of entities and multiversal environment you chose. 

SE:As I said in our previous dialogues,the other Source Entities and I were having a whale of a time.We were allowed to do anything we wanted. ME:Was this your own choice? SE:No.The first thing that the Origin said to us when we were aware of each other and the Origin was that we had to learn the art of experience-literally,how to experience and learn/ evolve from those experiences.The time in between our being aware of "self,each other, and the Origin was next to no time at all.It was almost instantaneous from my perspective, but you may think that millennia had gone by if you had to measure the time in human terms.At this point the Origin made us aware of its intentions for us and educated us on the reasons for our existence and the task that it was going to set us-all of which would result in the Origin's accelerated evolution and experience of its "self." The first thing we had to do was just create.We were told to create and experience anything and everything in any way we felt we would benefit by,simply by experiencing what we had created.This was primarily energetic at first but ultimately deviated into the frequential and dimensional aspects of creativity. ME:How do you mean? SE:Well,I think I had better focus on my own experience now as I am aware that I could start to explain what we were all experiencing rather than just myself.This will come out separately with each of the dialogues we have with the other Source Entities. ME:That's fine by me. SE:Let us continue then.Once I had experienced creativity from the energetic aspect in a general environmental sense,i.e.,who and where I was,I started to realize that the same level of creativity was not represented in the same way the higher up or lower down the frequencies.This changed significantly as I introduced the dimensional aspect to the object or item that I was creating.I noticed that if I created something in my current general environment,the representation in the higher and lower frequencies/dimensions was not the same.In fact,the change was quite marked. ME:Give me an example. SE:Let me take something that you would relate to as an example then,galaxies.When I created something that had singularity and was manifest into a lower frequency,it gained form.The lower down the frequencies I went,the more substantial the form was.When I went up the frequencies,the more insubstantial the form was and the more,for the want of a better word,fluidic it became. ME:You mean it became a fluid? SE:No,it is a figure of speech.By fluidic I mean that it was more without form.What's more it was able to interject in between the dimensions the higher up the frequencies it was.For example,it was so formless it had the ability to exist in any environment.Similarly, the lower down the frequencies,the more form the creation had and the less able it was to interject between the dimensions and lower frequencies.In fact,it ended up being locked into one set of frequencies and a corresponding dimension as well.The "formless"was purely energetic;the"formed"became nebulae in some of the higher frequencies,suns in the lower frequencies,and planets in the lowest frequencies.What was interesting is that what you call galaxies are not specifically"form"as the level of form is local to the frequencies that the "formed"naturally migrated to or were attracted to.This meant that as I created things that had form,they were either more or less in substance and had more or less form due to the pockets of higher or lower frequencies,i.e.,what I created was not pure of frequency or dimension.This explains why galaxies are what they are-vast areas of space with local areas of density-the local areas of density correlating to the lower frequencies,therefore, creating "form."That which was "formed"resulted in the round objects you call suns and planets. I found this fascinating and was entirely motivated into understanding that part that I had created that was form rather than formless.Hence,the universe you have today. ME:So you messed around with energy to create what we now recognize as galaxies.

SE:That's about the size of it. ME:So when did you decide to stop with the set of galaxies that we have today,bearing in mind that we also now recognize that there are myriad universes as well,each having its own set of galaxies?So here's a second question as well.When did you decide to stop with the set of universes that we have today? SE:Essentially when I realized that I was re-creating for the sake of it,I realized that I was not giving the creations that I had made enough time to mature and become something on their own.Everything that I had created was being manipulated by me just to see what it would look like.I had not recognized the possibility of extended creation through observation of form changing on its own as a result of its own inertia. ME:What does extended creation mean? SE:It means the creation of new creativity by that that has been created.In essence,that is what you,mankind,are doing now. Creation being created by that which was created-this was truly fascinating.Why I stopped re-creating the galaxies,which by the way are a function of creating universes,was because I realized that the level of creation resulting from me doing nothing but observing, observing that which I had created,was something significantly more interesting than I had even considered as a possibility.It was fun,but more importantly,it was a window into a new dimension of evolution for me.The universes were the environment from which the creation of physical form,the galaxies,suns and planets would ultimately take on their own dynamics.I,therefore,stopped the creation,re-creation cycle when I saw a pattern of creativity emerge that I thought had the most potential,i.e.,one that would bear the most fruit with the minimum of interaction. ME:So how did you create the universes? SE:The big bang theory that your scientists propose as the start of the universe is so far away from the truth it is not even worth considering.I didn't create the universes by igniting a gigantic match and it exploding and expanding,although it does sound like a good idea.No, I created the universes by simply giving the area within myself that energy that I wanted to be a universe,intention and purpose-the purpose being to become what it wanted to be, what it felt was the best form it should undertake in all the frequencies and dimensions that it eventually settled on being.This resulted in the areas that eventually became physical in form moving away from each other to give themselves space,the space to not be influenced by each other in any significant way. ME:Are you suggesting that the galaxies and the universes have sentience,intelligence? SE:I am not suggesting it;they ARE sentient,they ARE intelligent,but they are not intellectual-they simply exist.In essence,the universes and the resulting galaxies are living entities in their own rights.Each universe that I created,twelve of them,have the power to manipulate themselves into the condition they feel best suits their own personal taste-the galaxies being the physical representation of what the universes have created within themselves. ME:Ijust got an image/suggestion that the galaxies are similar to cells within our human bodies. SE:That is not a bad description,for they are the more solid part of the universe's form,as it were,and they do have a function to perform within the structure of the universe.But to say that they were the cells of a larger form would be wrong,for the function that they have to perform is not the result of bodily function or the function of an organ within a larger body.Their function is to collect that energy that is close in frequency or dimension to the physical and give it form.In doing so,they clear all of the stray energies that are within their universe,the energies resulting from their initial manifestation or creation. In essence,the objective of each of the galaxies is the grouping together of all of these energies into energy groups and giving them a purpose relative to the strengths and properties of their collective frequencies and energetic content.A good example of this can be seen in the physical bodies within what you call the solar system,the planets.Each of the planets is a grouping together of similar energies with each of the energies having a similar range of frequencies that manifest in a similar way in the lower dimensions-the similarity being enough to allow them to bind together.The result of such energies being similar but not quite the same is what you see in your periodic table.The earth is a classic example of this.It appears to be a solid lump in space made from the same material,but when you look deeper,you see that it is made up from a whole host of different materials that are only separated by frequency or a number of electrons.Sometimes only one frequency or electron will separate two different materials from each other when we synthesize them.Jupiter, on the other hand,is a classic example of a body that is a collection of higher frequency energies,the materials of which are gaseous in frequential representation in this dimension.

ME:I havejust gained a vision of a house made from bricks of different sizes,some being standard size,others being half size or double size-all of them being assembled together in a way that allows the house to be built and appear to be a single unit. SE:That is an excellent example and that is exactly what the galaxies are doing with the stray energies. ME:Is it fair to assume that at some point the galaxies were very small in comparison to what they are now? SE:Yes and no.Some of them started out at the large size they are now-their job being to collect the more subtle higher frequency energies.The smaller ones are more adept at gathering up the denser energies. ME:Like a black hole? SE:A black hole is,in fact,a small,very small galaxy.To do the job it has to do,it needs to be able to gather together energies that are right at the bottom of the frequencies of the dimensions they are working with.Hence,they have a lot of mass in comparison to their relative physical representation. ME:So this explains why the galaxies all have different shapes. SE:Yes,the shapes being relative to the energies they work with and the content of the energies they have managed to attract. In fact,some of the energies they work with are so difficult to work with that they have to create constructs to aid collection specific to the energy type they are working with.

ME:You mean like a machine? SE:No.This is an energetic construct;it is not physical at all.In fact,some of the constructs are so subtle they cannot be truly classified as a construct. ME:So what are they then if they are not whole enough to be classified as a construct? SE:They are more of an intention.Let me explain.Energies sometimes cannot be manipulated by physical or energetic means either alone or in total.This is because of the personality of the energy,for want of a better word.When the energy that is to be worked with does not respond to manipulation or transmutation,it means that the energy has personality.This means that the energy has a purpose of its own and will resist all changes that are intended to deviate it from this purpose.Thus,the energy needs to be persuaded to change the purpose of its existence to one that also includes the desire of the galactic entity. In doing this,it has to work with the energy for a long enough time for it to get used to the other energy that surrounds it or is close by to it.In essence,it needs to think of the galactic entity as part of it,even though it is not.The galactic entity,therefore,needs to manipulate its own base energy frequency and intention to one that is close enough to the signature energy of the energy to be attracted to allow it to be worked with whilst retaining enough of its own individuality to retain its own personality and beingness.Once the energy is "fooled" into thinking the galaxy is part of it,it is happy to have its intention changed to that of the galactic entity,provided that the galactic entity makes the changes to the intention in a subtle way that cannot be detected as an invasive energy. ME:So the galaxy,which is sort of an entity in its own right,has to fool the energy to be gathered that it is part of it and then re-program its intention/direction.

SE:That's it.Although it is a really basic thing to talk about,in actuality,it can take many millennia to complete.This is why some galaxies appear to be big dust clouds with just a handful or,indeed,no material at all that is dense enough to call a star or,indeed,a planet. Hence some of the beautiful images that your Hubble space telescope has taken since its placement in earth orbit. 

### The Function of the Galaxies 

ME:So what other jobs do galaxies do other than collect stray energies? SE:They provide refuge for entities that have sought to be associated with the energies that have coalesced into the physical frequencies or those that might provide opportunity for higher entities'experience and evolution. ME:Hold on a bit.Are you suggesting that galactic entities,"galaxies,"are fairly low down in the pecking order,entity-wise? SE:They are what they are.They are neither higher nor lower than other entities within my creativity.In essence,they are no different from you than I am from you.The only real difference is that they are of the group of entities that did not benefit as much as you and others like you did when I created you.In some respects,they are more important than you as they provide the opportunity for your growth and evolution,but in terms in their ability to experience,they are not nearly as nimble as you smaller,more agile entities. ME:So tell me more about what you meant by the galaxies providing refuge for the more agile entities. SE:The word "refuge"is a term of reference.It means place of security or place to live/exist.In essence,it is where the smaller,more compact and more agile/evolved entities can experience what they want to achieve to continue their evolutionary progression.This is where the galactic entities come into their own.Let me explain. Their primary role is to gather stray energy and give it purpose.That purpose is to provide substance,substance for the evolution of the individualized entities.In doing this,they also progress evolution-wise-this progression being the result of their being of service to the individualized entities.In doing this,they help in progressing the bigger picture by helping the Origin to understand itself more and,in turn,evolve. ME:So the galactic entities are part of the plan as well? SE:Yes.Every entity I have created is both part of the plan and has a role to play within the plan.In performing their roles,they also progress and evolve. Listen,the whole reason for all of our existence is to evolve-no question in that.Everyone, everything,every entity has a role to play in this,and we are enthusiastic in this role.In your exalted position of a free-thinking individualized entity,you are placed in a unique position to both assist in this goal and to accelerate it.But let me get back to the main answer to your question.The refuge given to you and the rest of the entities endowed with individuality is to provide the necessary theater for you to experience the things that you believe will result in your evolving in some(small)way.In your instance,this is by providing a physical location where you can experience a lower-much,much lower-level of existence than you would normally experience in your energetic state.

ME:That's interesting because I don't seek greatness personally;I seek to be part of something great. SE:And this is exactly what you are doing in all of your work.This is the whole point of it- to recognize and be part of something great,and you are doing it so very well. Let's get back to the refuge bit. The refuge that the galaxy has created for all of the entities that are associated with this area of this particular dimension is peculiar to the opportunities for physical experience. Each of the physical entities that you call stars and planets give the opportunity for physical incarnation,that is,the opportunity to experience life or existence in a state lower in frequency that you would normally experience in your energetic state.This does not necessarily mean that you have to incarnate into the biological form you know as humankind,for it can be any mixture of materials that can be manipulated or given a level of autonomy whilst providing the ability to sustain and,therefore,be used as a host for an energetic entity. ME:So what part of a planet is the most useful in this sense? SE:From your perspective,the obvious mediums for physical and mobile existence are the air and water-based environments.However,there are also many opportunities to be gained in the rock,snow,molten rock,or metal-based environments.These are areas where you have not seriously considered that life,let alone sentient life,can exist. ME:You mean that entities can live in molten lava? SE:Yes,of course.Just because the medium for existence is not as human-friendly as you expect or require,it does not mean that it is barren of life.Life that is useful as a vehicle for incarnation into the physical comes in many guises. ME:What does the physical form that exists in lava look like? SE:First,physical form does not have to look like anything;second,it does not need to be in the lower frequencies that result in what you would call tangible form,for the physical also spans into the liquid and gaseous.It even goes so far as the level of radio wave frequencies. As you can imagine,the form that would exist in a lava flow would need to be able to traverse it without hindrance.An example would be the entities that exist in the heart of you sun. They are physical in nature but not in any way that you could imagine. ME:I have just picked up this image of intelligent life moving around in the maelstrom of the chemicals and metals of the super-heated soup that is at the center of the sun's core.They look like pure intelligence that moves from particle to particle.When they are all together,those particles give a slightly black hue compared to the yellow background glow of the sun's core,the only indication of the location and movement of the intelligence within this medium. SE:Very well done.This is a great observation and one that is highly accurate to boot.The intelligence as you call it is a race called the Grahoopnik,spoken in the human language as "Gra-Hoo-Pneekuh."Their prime point of existence is in the hearts of suns.They like the security and feeling of the energies within the core of suns,in particular,as they provide energies that are peculiar to the temperatures achieved in the gravitational forces that surround them. ME:Do they migrate or move from sun to sun?

SE:Yes,of course.They do this instantaneously by logging into the signature of the energies they like best and moving on to the nearest sun that provides them. ME:I get the impression that they only move on when they have removed all of the energies they like from the sun they are currently in. SE:Yes,that is true. ME:Can I ask a leading question?Do these entities cause suns to explode and turn into super novas? SE:That is sometimes the result of their existence and vacating their last point of reference, yes. ME:Will our sun go super nova as a result of their residence and ultimate leaving? SE:Yes,it will,but do not worry.Humankind in its current form will be long gone a millennia before as it will have progressed beyond the need for the particular type of physicality that it currently uses for its evolutionary vehicle.The physical demise of both the sun and the solar system will occur;your current Earth will no longer exist as you know it to be. ME:Do you mean it will disappear totally,or will it change to some other energetic form? SE:The Earth and the rest of the planets in the solar system will have translated to their next level of evolution before the sun's physical presence is removed.In fact,the energies released from the sun as a result of the existence of the Grahoopnik within the sun will be the catalyst for frequential progression.In their living and migrating from sun to sun,they can leave a trail of what you in the physical call "destruction,"but they can also leave what we in the energetic call "areas of progression."Therefore,the Earth will only die in physical terms;it will not die in energetic terms.This is also your future heritage. ME:In effect,you are saying that the Grahoopnik have an important and symbiotic relationship with the human race's opportunity for evolutionary progression? SE:They inadvertently assist in the frequential progression of many physical races,and they will assist in the progression of humankind as well.But please take note on what I said before.Humankind will be long gone from the physical when the sun physically dies since the energies that are released that assist in the increase in frequency happen a long time before physical dissolution/demise.In fact,some of you will note that a change in frequency is already happening.This is both a result of humankind's natural progression and the local existence of the Grahoopnik in your sun. ME:Yes,a number of well-known mediums have been saying this for some years,but they only attribute it to the increase in humans who are becoming aware and not as an additional result of an outside force,such as the Grahoopnik. SE:No,they would not know that.They could not know that,for they are not expansive enough in their mediumship. ME:Why not? SE:Because they only look for what is in the human mind and not what is in the universal mind,so they miss the rest of the detail.This is a great shame,for there is much,much more that needs to be transmitted to mankind.I can only do this through people like you. ME:Thank you.

### Galaxies-A Force for Change 

ME:O.K.,so we have talked about the galaxies as being a refuge for the development of many physical races-some of which,like the Grahoopnik,exist within extreme environments on the edge of physicality that humankind does not even recognize as such.We have even talked about the other roles of galaxies,such as the gathering up of stray energies.What else do they have to do in the bigger picture? SE:They are the guardians of the space that they exist within;this is their main role.They are given complete autonomy in this and answer to no one but myself.If you consider that the universes I created are the playground of the more intelligent entities,so to speak,a playground of evolutionary opportunity,then you will realize that this playground needs to be nurtured,looked after,and modified to best suit the needs of the entities that are using it. This is the role of the galaxies:to look at the physical opportunities that they present to the entities that are in existence for purely evolutionary existence,such as yourself,and modify themselves upon demand to offer the best experiences possible.By"on demand,"I mean that the galaxy has the ability to look inwardly and see where the areas for improvement are and amend itself accordingly. ME:Do you mean that the galaxies are able to change their look and feel locally or globally on a daily basis,or do they only change when the opportunity is best offered to them by the activities of the entities within them? SE:They generally wait for a significant event to happen that will give the opportunity for change more impetuous.If the change was to be on a daily basis,you would witness the disappearance/appearance of stars and planets or,in fact,the location or re-location of new or existing stars and planets.Let me make one thing clear though.Changes generally happen over a long period of time as the affected races need the time to adapt and adjust to their new environment.It is rare that a change is required on an instantaneous timeframe.This is not to say that it can't be done.It has,but a change of such a level requires a complete evacuation of all the existing entities within the area to be changed,which,of course,requires some planning since many of the entities are incarnate in the physical to a level similar to yourself. Thus,the evacuation has to be staged in a way that is consistent with their normal return to the energetic. ME:So how would you engage in an instantaneous evacuation of incarnate entities to make a change? SE:By catastrophe. ME:What? SE:By catastrophe.By far the fastest way to evacuate a large number of incarnate entities is to evoke a catastrophe.This would allow the change to be made directly after the last entity to leave the physical is properly back in the energetic. ME:But isn't a catastrophe a rather harsh way of making a change? SE:Not in the slightest.It is not used for fun,but when it is deemed necessary,it is used without issue by any of the entities involved.For many of them,the mere act of being part of such an event comes high on their evolutionary experience list.You on Earth have already experienced two such events on a very local level-one of them you even have racial memory of;you call it the“"great flood.”ME:Are you saying that the great flood was the result of our galaxy affecting a change on the earth to make it a better place to evolve in? SE:That's about the size of it,yes.You see,at that point in time,the earth required a change in biosphere type to enable the ratio of water and land-based entities to be adjusted in accordance with the number of incarnate entities it could support.In the earth's instance, there needed to be an increase in the area of water to allow the water-based entities to increase in number.This required a dramatic reduction in the land that was available and a suitable reduction in the maximum number of land-based entities. ME:The change was to allow more dolphins to be incarnate? SE:The dolphin physicality is but one of the many water-based entities that offer the opportunity for incarnation into the physical.There are many more water-based entities in your seas than you are aware of.A great many of them live in the semi-physical states and are,therefore,not readily detectable.Some keep themselves very much to themselves whilst others live in parts of the ocean that is so deep you simply have not been down there long enough to see them. ME:So how many land-based entities were evacuated,so to speak? SE:Approximately 20 billion. ME:20 billion.We don't have that many people on the earth now,and we are quite advanced. SE:Don't forget that the ratio of land mass to water mass was significantly different at that time.In fact,the water mass was 20-30%of what it is now,so there was a lot of land for the land-based entities to live on. ME:And they alljust rolled over and accepted the change? SE:Yes.They knew at the energetic (higher self)level that the change was necessary,and,as such,their souls were ready to leave.When the time came,they dissolved their links with their physical vehicles and returned to the energetic en mass.The physical vehicles were not left behind,of course,as they were returned to their core elements during dissolution.Only a few of the incarnate land-based entities elected to stay.In doing so,they had to create a number of vehicles to protect their physical bodies,including a core volume of the species most necessary to protect the continuation of the flora and fauna.What you would call an ARK. ME:And all of the incarnate entities knew that they needed to dissolve themselves to allow this change for the better? SE:Yes,and what's more some of them were architects in the need to make the change.These were also the ones that stayed behind to commence the re-building. ME:This is a good example of a small local change.What about a large change? SE:A large change is far too big for you to understand as it takes a significant amount of time to plan and involves whole sectors of space,not just a particular planet or planetary system. Because of this I will give you an example of a medium sized change that a galaxy may wish to undertake. ME:How big would this be?

SE:Several planets,and,in some instances,more than one planetary system.It would certainly include the local star,which would be involved from its own evolutionary perspective due to the very nature of the physical reaction necessary to make the change. ME:What are you suggesting?Oh,I get it.The star is going nova. SE:Well done.The nova state is,in fact,the smaller of the two events that could be described as a medium-sized change and the slightly larger being what you describe as a supernova. ME:So what is the difference between the two,apart from the obvious fact that one is bigger than the other? SE:The nova-sized influence involves only one star.The second,the supernova,is much bigger and can involve a number of stars. I will explain this further. A nova is used to make a change in the area local to the star being used as the catalyst. It generally only involves the planetary entities and those entities that are associated with those planets close to the star.You see a nova as a destructive force with the star exploding and destroying the planets close to it and any life on those planets.The sun later is reduced to a white dwarf when all the energy is spent,the area then being dead.This is not the case since what is happening is both of a housekeeping nature to the galaxy and an evolutionary nature to the physical bodies involved.You see,if the galaxy needs to make a change that involves the star and its wards,its planets-remember that both are energetic entities on their own right-the galaxy offers the star two options.These options greatly depend on the evolutionary condition of the star and its planets,which will include the work that the smaller entities,such as you (humankind),has achieved to date.If the star and its planets/ inhabitants are ready for an evolutionary change that is beneficial to them,then the star will undergo a change that increases the local frequency enough for them all to move on to the next level.The process is what your astronomers observe as a nova.In essence,the star, with the aid of the galaxy,increases its frequency to the point where it appears to explode, destroying the planets that are associated with it,leaving only debris,spent fuel,the dwarf star,and asteroids.In reality what has happened is that they have all moved up to the next frequency level,leaving behind the untranslatable physical aspects of themselves.In essence,they have given up their physicality,all of them,all together. ME:Would not the inhabitants of the planets/star move upwards through the frequencies first with the star and the planets following them? SE:No,this is not part of the process.Simplistically put,they all move onwards and upwards together.To not do so would be like moving from a house without a house to go to for the first couple of days of the move.It would not be synchronous.This is important as it maintains the balance between that which has progressed in the frequencies,that which remains,and that which is governed for in the spatial/dimensional planning. In the event that the star and its planets/inhabitants are not yet ready to move upwards in the frequencies,they are moved to a new location in keeping with the plan the galaxy has for its own evolution and housekeeping. ME:You mean to say that whole solar systems are moved to somewhere else? SE:Yes,this is quite common.

ME:How long does this take? SE:It is instantaneous.However,it is the product of a significant amount of planning on behalf of the galaxy and the star and must also be of benefit to them as well.Both methods require planning,and all inhabiting entities are involved from an awareness point of view. They are also given help from the entities in the locale where they are moving because the inclusion of a new star system has an effect on them as well.Consider the gravitational effects from both the attractivity of physical mass and the changes to the communication aspect that the change to the gravity profile in the receiving area has.It all has to be planned. ME:We could talk about this for a very long time. SE:The detail of this could only briefly be described,for it would require many volumes to do it justice. ME:So what about supernovas? SE:Supernovas are basically a bigger version of what I have just described.The only issue here is that we are not just talking about the opportunity to move multiple star systems. Change of this magnitude means that the opportunity for physical relocation is not only unnecessary but is not even considered.In essence,the supernova method of increasing the frequencies of the star/planetary and inhabiting entities in this area is a result of the whole area being ready to move upwards.This is usually the product of a significant length of time where all of the entities in the area,star/planetary and incumbent dimensional beings, have been working together to increase their evolutionary condition to the point where the galaxy has taken the opportunity to make both the opportunity and plans to lift that part of itself up to the next level. ME:I have just received the image of a galaxy moving parts of itself up to the next level of frequency on a gradual basis,one bit at a time,rather like putting a frame tent up. SE:This is a good analogy and is what happens in most examples.However,there are a small number of galaxies who move everything associated with them up to the next frequency level simultaneously,but this needs every entity associated with that galaxy to be on the same evolutionary flight path,so to speak. This is difficult to maintain and control-not from a"translation up the frequencies"point of view but from a "control of the equilibrium"of the areas that are ready to be translated versus those that are close to being translated but could drop backwards in the frequencies and,therefore,put the translation at risk. Planets,the Workforce of the Galaxies ME:We have reviewed the way you created the universe/s and the work that the galaxies perform. We have even discussed the role that some of the entities that live in the stars have and what the stars do to help the galaxies change local areas of space to a condition that is better suited to the evolution of the evolutionary process in the physical planes and the closest energetic planes.I would now like to discuss the roles the planets have in this work. SE:First,let me remind you that as with all physical bodies in the physical universe that are but a small portion of what they represent in the energetic,so the work the galaxies and the stars perform in the physical is also manifested in the energetic.This is the same for the planets,for they are also entities in their own right.

ME:So let me get the chronology right before we start on the planets'roles. You created the universes to provide an environment for a smaller set of entities to exist within.This level of creation formed energies that manifest itself in all levels of frequency in all dimensions within each of the universes in various forms,some of which are within the frequencies we humans call the physical.These energies,including those in the physical were given form and awareness of self,beginning and recognition of source,you the Source Entity.Responsible to you,they were then given roles and responsibilities to ensure the maintenance of their environment would be kept to an optimal.Part of this involved the opportunity for their own evolution since they were given individuality,though coadunate with you.In the maintenance of their environment,they tidy up the manifested physical form energies into energies similar to their own frequencies-thus,creating galaxies.As galaxies they further their work by concentrating on the smaller energies and collate them into stars and planets-some stars and planets being attracted to each other,others not. When the planets are of a certain size or energetic density that is enough to endow them with retention of memory and recognition of self,they gain awareness,self-awareness,and recognition structure of others like them.They are then give roles and responsibilities in keeping with those of their galaxy. SE:Very good summary.As soon as they achieved this last part,I released the remaining entities such as yourself into the universes I created.All of you have three main things embedded within your consciousness: 1.Recognition of self(awareness); 2.Recognition of origin(me,your Source Entity)and position within a hierarchy;

3.Recognition of goal (to experience and evolve as a result). Some of you have a fourth item embedded within your consciousness-freewill. ME:I thought we were all created at the same time? SE:You were,but I held my most precious creations back until I was satisfied the environment had achieved a minimal level of structure before introducing you to it.Now let's get back to the planets. The role of the planets is threefold:(1)to provide a smaller cleaning/gathering function by attracting denser energies and integrating them;(2)to provide a focal point for the physical and energetic existence of smaller energetic entities;(3)to experience and evolve in their own right.In doing these three things,they provide the most basic functions for the continued function of the universe for they are the workers at the "coal face,"so to speak. They are the origin and the creator of what you call nature spirits.In fact,they are nature spirits in their own right. ME:What do you mean?Are you saying that the planet performs a similar role in the solar system/galaxy that the nature spirits on Earth itself perform-like maintenance of the lower life forms,such as trees and rocks? SE:Absolutely.Know this:every entity in the universe/s I have created has a role to play in the maintenance of their locale-whether it be collecting stray energy,keeping the frequencies of the energy as high as possible,providing a refuge for physical existence for the smaller energy beings,or simply evolving themselves.As an example of some of Earth's physical work in the space it occupies,you only need see the aurora borealis,the "northern lights."These are a physical manifestation of the cleaning-up exercise that Earth performs in removing and converting local levels of cosmic energy that are detrimental to the functionality of physical beings on Earth's plane and disturb the clarity of communication between the entity you call the sun and those entities whose job it is to maintain the direction of "solar wind."Solar wind is used by "star"entities to exchange energies-other than those that are self-generated-with other star entities.In essence,the planets have one of the most important jobs in the universe.They have a responsibility to those smaller entities that use their surfaces for the existence of their physical vehicles by making sure they maintain the ecosystem at the most optimal possible condition-even when they are making changes to themselves to enable energetic adaptations to take place. A planet's contribution to the evolution game is at its most effective when it houses more than two sentient/high level energy being types in the energetic,the physical,or both simultaneously.In fact,the more entity types it can support,the more effective its contribution,and the faster it can evolve in its own right. ME:So how many entities does Earth currently support? SE:Three,plus the visitors of which there are over twenty different types. ME:Let me guess the three:humans,dolphins,and another animal of some sort? SE:We have discussed this in some shape or form before,especially about the fact that dolphins are one of the other races that are using Earth for evolutionary purposes.The third is purely energetic and exists in an area in one of your seas that is secluded from mankind but not from the dolphins.In fact,the dolphins communicate with this third race on a very regular basis. ME:Does mankind communicate with them on some secret basis? SE:Energetically,you know of their existence,of course,but from the view point of physical mankind you have no idea of their existence and have never seen or felt their presence. ME:Will we ever meet them? SE:Only when mankind as a collective affects a change in their frequency level to the point where physical incarnation is no longer necessary. ME:Will this be soon? SE:It will not be in several hundred physical lifetimes.Before this can happen,the frequency of Earth has to be raised seven frequency levels,and this can only be done when the human race decides to give up the need for personal gratification and is more concerned about his fellow man and always puts his neighbor first.At this point mankind will work on an individual level/basis for the good of the whole without the need for catastrophes to act as a catalyst for communal working.Even now catastrophes don't work that well because so-called celebrities use them for their own ends by purporting to be concerned about the safety and well-being of those affected when really all they are doing is using the catastrophes as an opportunity for publicity.Do not seek to be a celebrity!It is a sure fire way to slow your evolution down. But let's get back to the role of planets.As stated recently,a planet as an entity in its own right contributes significantly to the maintenance of its locale.Part of that maintenance occurs as a result of its own evolution.As a planet literally gives itself up for the benefit of others,its opportunity for evolutionary advancement is massive and so is the opportunity to affect an increase in frequency in the locale.However,it is also affected by the frequency changes made by those entities it hosts,and in Earth's instance,it simply has not caught up with the loss of frequency caused by mankind's mistakes. ME:So a planet's role is to provide habitation,clean up energies that are harmful to those inhabitants,and maintain certain communication lines between the star entities and those that work with the solar winds. SE:That is a short and sweet way of putting it,yes.But they have one more role. ME:What is that? SE:To add substance to the fabric of the universe in both the energetic and physical frequency levels.Essentially they are the glue that holds it all together. The Creation and Roles of Smaller Entities ME:As you said in the first book,you created billions of smaller entities to experience and evolve as part of the creation process of the universe/s.The objective was/is to experience existence at the largest/smallest possible level and at the highest/lowest possible frequency. I have to admit that I was very surprised to learn that we were kept on the back burner,so to speak,until you had stabilized-if that is the right word-the universe. SE:Stabilization is a necessary part of the process of creation.Had I introduced you all at a point just after the creation of the universe/s,you would have been swept away in the maelstrom that resulted from the coalescence of the energies.You would have lost your datum dimension and frequency level as well as your direction,especially since the galaxies were working on shepherding energies on all dimensions on all frequencies simultaneously. It was a tumultuous period and one that needed its own time to complete.So the smaller entities,such as you,had to wait in a holding area until the environment was ready for you to move into. ME:So what did we do whilst in this holding area? SE:Nothing. ME:Nothing? SE:Nothing.You see,although I had created you all,none of you were in a position to recognize your "self.You had no self-awareness and,therefore,achieved nothing.In actual fact,if one or two of you had started to develop awareness,I would have held you in stasis because relocation to your new dimension so quickly after becoming aware of your initial surroundings would have been somewhat confusing to you. ME:Why would it have been confusing?I thought that we are just smaller versions of your self and that we are able to work with most,if not all,the energies in your universe? SE:This is very true,but the issue was that the area of holding was a very limited dimensional/frequential resource and,therefore,of little stimulation.The length of time you were in the holding area was such that if you were aware,you would have tuned into the limitations of that area of habitation and adapted to it.To have done so at such an early part of your existence would have meant that you would have programmed yourselves to be smaller than your potential.You would have been like the fish that grows to suit the size of the pond,so to speak;you would be stunted with very little chance of recovery.

ME:Why would we not have recovered? SE:When I created you all,I gave you the ability to expand to the limits of your abilities in the universe that I was creating,a sort of automatic one time program designed to make you automatically become the best you will ever be functionally but with the ability to grow as individuals,to evolve.If this program/process started,you would have expanded to the abilities that you would have been capable of achieving in the holding area,which was extremely limiting.Fortunately,none of you had been created for very long,just a few millennia,and,therefore,had not achieved self-awareness and therefore kicked off the program of expansion. ME:Tell me more about this program.What else did it contain? SE:Apart from attunement to the dimensions and the frequencies that are associated with the universes that I created-which in itself gives you your expansiveness-it also identified the level of entity you were-remember we discussed the fact that some of the entities I created were not of the same type due my attention not being equally spread amongst my creations during the creativity process-and where you would be best located dimensionally.Those that were"whole"were allowed to expand to the level where they could work in any of the environments,dimensions/frequencies within the universal expanse whilst others were limited to smaller areas.Once they were attuned,the next part started:the realization of self,which also started the recognition of others and the interaction with others.The objective here was that the entities would achieve more if the recognition of self and others was simultaneous.Coupled together with this was the knowledge of the need to experience as much as possible and to evolve as a consequence.

Next,the knowledge of position within the universe was made accessible,including their mission in existence and the understanding of who the Origin is and why it created the twelve Source Entities.Finally,knowing that individuality is maintained even in oneness and the desire to return to Source,bringing back all experiences,was ingrained into the memory. ME:The parts of the programming that you have just mentioned are these: Realization of self; Recognition of others; Experiencing existence; Evolving; Recognizing one's position within the universe; Recognizing one's mission in existence; Understanding the Origin and its creations; Returning to the Source when appropriate; .Maintaining oneness whilst in the whole/source. These are essentially what our role is in the universe.This is all we have to do.It's simple. SE:Not as simple as it would seem.Remember we talked about karma in the previous dialogues in your first book.Remember about being coerced by the desires of the physical and how easy it was to get tied up in the demands of the physical to the point where you no longer work for the good of others but only for yourself?

ME:Yes,I do. SE:Well,this is a reason why it is not so simple.It's also one of the main reason why you, the smaller entities,were created.On behalf of myself and the Origin,you were all created to tackle the issue of "self,"which all of the former bulleted items identify.In summary,the main role of all of the smaller entities in existence is to experience that which the Origin hasn't yet experienced and relay this information back to the Origin.In essence,the Origin has hatched a brilliant plan:as you experience,so do I and so does the Origin.What's more with all of the billions of entities the other twelve Source Entities and I have created,the opportunity for experiencing its self-for we are all within and,therefore,part of the Origin -is multiplied by a factor relative to the number of smaller entities created and actively experiencing.The one thing you must note is that there is no duplication here.Every experience is separate.

ME:Why is this?I would have thought that,if say,100 entities all experienced the same thing, such as a natural disaster or a football match,that it would amount to the same thing. SE:This is not so.It is the underlying beauty of being a separate entity.You see,even if you are part of a collective and you experience the same thing as your brother in collective existence,you each will personally experience the experience in a subtly different way.The way in which you experience it will be relevant to your own evolution and experience in addition to whether you are incarnate or not or the type of environment you have been incarnate in.Remember:incarnation isn't necessarily in a state that is as physically dense or in as low a frequency as you are experiencing now,for physicality has many levels of frequency.In summary,the whole point of existence and,therefore,the role of the smaller entities are to experience,evolve,furnish feedback,and return.

## Chapter 2 - Source Entity Two 

At this point I have to admit to feeling a significant amount of trepidation.I am about to communicate with another of the Source Entities,one that we shall call Source Entity Two (SE2). The Creator of our multiverse being Source Entity One but simplistically being referred to as "The Source Entity"(SE).It is a strange feeling,rather like having writer's block.I have no idea what we are going to talk about even though I do have a simple agenda of questions,which I shall use for discussions with all the Source Entities.This should keep it simple,as I am in no doubt that many of the concepts that I am about to have thrust upon me will be well over my head.I only hope I can put them into words that both the readers of this text and I can understand. ME:Ifeel the communication start,but it feels strange-like I am rubbing my head up and down the bark of an oak tree. SE:That is because you are trying to communicate with the Source,SE2,directly rather than via myself.You are created from my own energies;these are in variance to the energies that the other Source Entities are working with.As a result,it will be like hitting a brick wall, for you are out of tune,out of phase,and out of(universal)structure.I am not surprised you feel like you are rubbing your head up and down the bark of an oak tree.What I am surprised about is that you even got to this stage;you actually made a link directly to SE2. I am impressed;this will make our communication with SE2 much easier as the level of translatory intervention I will have to make will be reduced as a result.Don't get me wrong.

I will still need to be the main contact,and in most cases you will be communicating with SE2 via me,but in the link you have you will be able to pick up much more than SE2 speaking through my words to you.You may also gain imagery during the dialogue. ME:So can you tell me how this Source Entity divided itself? SE:Yes.In this instance,SE2 divided itself in a very similar way to the way I did,but it divided itself up by four instead of twelve,so,in effect,you have 12x4x12x3 different dimensional levels.That is 1,728 dimensions within four universes. ME:So would this similarity be the reason why I was able to affect some sort of initial communication? SE:No.Just because the methodology of division is similar doesn't mean that the frequencies and dimensions within the environment created have the same characteristics -hence,the way you felt when you established contact on your own. ME:Thank you for the clarification.So can you formally introduce me to the second source,SE2? SE:Yes.We are in contact right now. ME:Oh,Ifeel that I am in an environment that is full of green/grey/red clouds. SE2:These are my children.You would call them nebula.They form the larger part of the beings that I have created. ME:O.K.I think I would like to stop here and ask that I follow a structure that is similar,if not the same,to the first part of this book.It would keep it simple for me and those who read it later. SE2:We can do that if you wish.

ME:I am sorry to mention it,but you sound like you are in pain.Your voice sounds like it is deep and hollow. 

SE2:I can assure you that I am not in pain.The sound of my voice,the method that you have chosen to communicate by,is relative to my overall resonant frequency.This is the way that you will be able to tell me apart from your own Source Entity. 

### Source Entity Two's Early Existence 

ME:I have talked to my Source Entity on its becoming aware in the first period of its existence. Can you explain how you became aware and what you felt? SE2:As with your own Source Entity,I was allowed to become aware in my own time.This is one of the rules the Origin placed upon itself.It was a strange sensation.Becoming aware that you "are"in existence is rather like looking at a cloud of energy and then realizing that it is a cloud of energy.As you start to pick out things in your local environment and identify them by giving them a name or a label,you start to consider who and what you are yourself. At this point I started to investigate my "self"and realized that it was a big task,especially if I looked into my "self"at the smallest level.It was during this phase of my existence-when I was becoming more aware of what I was and what I could do-that the Origin contacted me and explained that I was a smaller part of its"self."It was also at this time I had established that there were others like me just next door. ME:Yes,I get an image of you all bunched up together,like black balls all together inside a bigger ball-that bigger ball being the Origin.

![图1](img/s6-025.png)

SE2:That is a good description.But don't forget that the Origin is absolute and infinite,there is nothing but the Origin,the Origin is "all,"so this image in your mind's eye that shows the Origin as a smaller entity is flawed and is a result of your limited ability to understand in your current projection. ME:So what did the Origin say to you when it contacted you for the first time? SE2:It explained the reason for my existence and the reason for the other Source Entities' existence.This you have from your own Source Entity.More importantly it stated that how I achieve the task it gave me was entirely up to me.There were no time limits and no constraints on power or energy used.It was a simple meeting.The Origin went to some length to make it so and to show me what the Origin was in its entirety just so that I could understand what it was and what I was and how I fitted in.Once the Origin had explained everything that it knew to me,I felt that I was one and the same.I was the Origin,which as a division of the Origin we all are.As a result of this,I had what you might call a"kick-start" in the right direction.The change in me was instantaneous.One moment I was just me in existence and thought;the next moment,that is after the Origin gave me all its knowledge,I was personified.I was energy and thought,given knowledge and a purpose:to find out what

I was,to experience what I was,and to evolve.As I was a part of the Origin,everything I did would be automatically fed back to the Origin in an experiential way,so I wouldn't need to contact the Origin specifically to report back on the progress I was making.It was at this point that I started to have what you would call "fun"by manipulating the energy that was all around us.I was particularity good at making shapes and dimensional constructs. ME:So how did you decided on the 12x4x12x3 dimensional universe? 

SE2:I decided that I would create four environments from which to base my learning environment on simply because I wanted to have four different experiments running at the same time.Each universe-if you want to call the environments that-were constructed in a different way.Each had a different purpose and a different set of rules. 

ME:You had a different set of rules for each environment?Why?What were the rules? 

SE2:I wanted to see how the entities that I would create later in order to populate these environments would fare if they had a different set of constraints placed on them,but with the same goal.One of the environments-let's call it environment one for the sake of argument-had no constraints and had all the abilities I had.The others had components of those abilities removed. 

### The Four Environments of SE2 - Environment 1-10,000 Source Entities,One Environment 

ME:Can you explain what the abilities and components were that you removed?No,tell me about the first environment first,and then tell me what the constraints were in the remaining three environments.

SE2:As just stated,the first environment contained every attribute that I was given by the Origin.Everything was within the environment right down to the lowest dimension and frequency.Additionally,the entities that I created were direct copies of me,only smaller in what you would call volume.They were constrained,however,in one way:they could only exist within the environment that I created.That is,they could not return to the Source,me, as you can with your own Source Entity. ME:Why did you do that?What would be the point of it? SE2:I wanted to give them total autonomy.With the level of power that I had given them, equal to me,they could quite literally turn their environment upside down and inside out. I wanted them to know this and to appreciate that they would have no help from me in correcting whatever mess they got themselves into and that they were the masters of their own destiny,whichever way they took themselves. ME:So what was the goal that you gave them? SE2:The goal or task was the same as yours.We all have the same task from the Origin:to experience all that there is in as many different ways as possible and evolve as a result. ME:But you have given them everything and nothing.You have given them a task and not a route home-to you. SE2:I have given them everything.They have total autonomy from me,they are masters of their own universe,and they will exist for as long as I exist. ME:And how long will you exist?

SE2:For as long as the Origin wants us to exist.It has no plans to remove that existence to my knowledge,but my/our/your existence is still at the prerogative of the Origin and its pleasure in my/our/your existence. ME:Mmm,O.K.,I think I have been advised on this subject before by my Source Entity. SE:You have,and it is a consistent story that you will hear from all of the Source Entities. ME:It is good to realize that you are still here and that I can recognize you as my Source Entity. SE:Yes,don't forget that I still need to support the link you have with SE2,which is why you are finding it so easy to communicate with it. ME:Thank you.So,getting back to the first environment from SE2's experiments,can you please give me an example of the type of power these entities had in the first environment? SE2:As explained a few moments ago,they had total power.But I can see that you need an example.Quite simply,they have the power to either totally destroy themselves by refusing to exist anymore or they can reproduce themselves or their environment. ME:Reproduction of self I can understand,but reproduction of environment,whole universe/ multiverses?Why would they want to do that?How would they do it? SE2:How they do it is up to them,but one way would be to segment a portion of the environmental volume that I gave them to create a duplicate.Another way would be to mirror the whole volume of the environment by copying it and placing it on a level of dimension or frequency that is just out of alignment with the original. ME:But would you need to remove a frequential or dimensional component from the existing environment to achieve this? SE2:Good question.No,you are thinking in terms of your own environment and its physical physics.The way it would be achieved is by... ME:I am getting a picture of a sort of process where you make better use of the space available; err,rather like a double space program on a computer makes more space on a hard drive by using a form of compression algorithm that maintains all of the attributes of the files on the hard drive whilst making them smaller,thereby saving space. SE2:That wasn't the description I was going to use,but it is one that will suffice.It is a good enough example for your readers to understand.In fact,it is possibly the only way that you will be able to understand the process. ME:Why is this? SE2:I was having trouble embedding the information into your limited energetic memory. It just wasn't capable of receiving the concept I was prepared to give to you.Multiversal compression is a good enough example to use. ME:So if the entities within Environment 1 are all powerful,they must have a hard time living together. SE2:They do not fight if that is what you are insinuating.They each have the same capabilities and they have full respect of their role within their environment. ME:How many entities did you create for the first environment? SE2:You would call it a round number and,therefore,suspicious.

ME:Go on.Try me. SE2:Ten thousand. ME:You're right.It is a round number and I am suspicious. SE2:? ME:What?Is that it?Silence? SE2:What would you have me say?Do you want me to give you justification for such a whole number? ME:Err,yes actually.I had a similar issue with the number of levels that my Source Entity created.They were based on 100. SE2:One of the things that you must note is that the numbers that I/we use are in the language that you would understand.I/we use whole numbers because of the ease of communication.Suffice to say,the number I gave you is correct and as such is understandable by you and others.Would a number of 9,892 have any more credence with you? ME:It might. SE2:Then use that.It is not correct,for it was 10,000. ME:O.K.,I think I will leave this little digression in the text of this dialogue;the mere fact thatyou are questioning my questioning is validation enough for me. SE:Rest now.You are tired. A few days later I continued the conversation.

ME:Can we continue with the first of the four environments you created? SE2:Yes,of course. ME:One of the questions that I have not asked is about the appearance of the entities in this environment and what they created as a civilization. SE2:I will answer your question in two parts.In terms of their appearance,they have none that you would recognize. ME:How do you mean? SE2:They do not have a physical appearance.I can see that you are waiting for further clarification. ME:Yes,please. SE2:They have no method of being described physically because the environment within which they exist does not have dimensions or frequencies that are low enough to cause a physical projection.Simply put:they are purely "Source Essence"and so is their environment. ME:Hold on here.I have just received an image or concept in my mind that states that they are all one and the same-that is,their environment and the entities are all one. SE2:That is correct.That is why they have no form,either physical or energetic,that you can use to distinguish them apart from their environment. ME:Is this why you only created 10,000?

SE2:Yes,it is also why I gave them total autonomy.They are as I am within my own environment,totally omnipotent. ME:So how do you tell them apart?Do they have a signature or something that enables you to identify which one of the ten thousand they are? SE2:They can only be told apart by their thought processes.Each one has a different thought process that they use to create the opportunity to experience and evolve.But please note this:not all of them are in full separate existence at the same time. ME:I beg your pardon?You mean that one moment they are in existence and another they are not? SE2:As you noted before,they are one and the same and,therefore,one with their environment.I see you are frowning.I will send you an image of what I mean. I then received an image of a mass of something,say a cloud.This cloud was on its own as an undulating mass.Then I saw a mass of what I can only describe as rain drops.Each rain drop had its own sentience.As I looked further and into the cloud,which I was told was their environment,I noticed that each of the drops had a role to play and a job to do.Each role and job was either personally assigned or collectively assigned.Before the role/job was assigned,the rain drop that was to do the role was not a separate entity.It was fully part of the cloud.When the role was defined and the interaction with other raindrops or energies was established,a rain drop or a series of rain drops would be formed,and they would do what was necessary to perform and complete the task.When the task was complete,the rain drop or drops would return to the cloud and lose their singularity.They became one with the cloud again.Their singularity was lost,but their essence was maintained within the cloud, the/their environment.The cloud,the environment,was built of Source Essence that could be separated into two parts:environmental essence and individualized essence.

![图2](img/s6-026.png)

SE2:Now do you understand how they exist? ME:Yes,I think I do.That image was a really simple and effective way of describing what they are.I take it that there are no clouds or rain drops-that was just a method to describe the function of environment and individualized energy,a way to explain in simple terms how there can be a "variance"in the number of entities in existence,for want of a better word.It's a way to show that there never are all of the entities you created within this environment in singular existence at any one time,or are there times? SE2:There have been times,and there will be times when they are all in existence as single entities all together,so to speak.Such a time is when they are all needed to change the characteristics of the environment within which they exist,for this can only be achieved when all are in agreement. ME:Yes,I appreciate that would be a limitation.So what about civilization?Do they have one? Did they create one?

SE2:Civilization is a word that is peculiar to your physical-based existence.It determines that entities or beings behave in a way that you classify as civilized,that a certain level of co- operation and technology is present and the level of technology is a product of the level of co-operation on a personal and group basis.I am correct in this assumption? ME:Yes,you are. SE2:Well,in this instance you can say that the entities and the environment within which they exist are civilized. ME:What?Is that it?Was there no creativity or area/environment which a group of them created for the betterment of them all and that has stood the test of time to show that they were,in fact, civilized and could be called a civilization,and that it was successful or failed? SE2:Not in the way that you perceive things,no.For how could a group of entities that are essentially Source Essence and part of an environment that is created out of Source Essence become something that they have always been-in co-operation? ME:You mean they have never become uncivilized/they have never failed to achieve their goal,a goal that if it failed would have resulted in some form of digression between the entities involved. SE2:No.You see,even when they have failed to achieve the goal that they set themselves, they have managed to learn something,they have experienced something,they have evolved in some way. ME:I suppose in this instance if the entities concerned really are one and the same with themselves and their environment and are also truly omnipotent,they would behave in a civilized way.

SE2:The correct description would be that they behave in a highly evolved way,for each of them is aware of the power they have singularly,collectively,and environmentally.They are aware of their function within the environment and the group and have nothing to gain or lose by"going it alone."However,they have had a number of experiments where only one or two of them would split off from the whole and work alone. ME:What was the outcome of these experiments? SE2:That they are more efficient at evolving by doing things as a whole.They did find evolution singularly an interesting concept,but it was detrimental to the evolution of the whole. 

### Environment 2-The Cast-out Principle 

ME:O.K.,let's move on to the second environment that you created.What limitations did you put on the environment and its inhabitants? SE2:In this instance I allowed them the opportunity to return to their source if they wished. They could/can also return to singularity if they wish/wished.In this they are similar to you but only in this instance. ME:How do you mean? SE2:They don't have free will like you do. ME:What other limitations do they have? SE2:They are not omnipotent in their own environment like the entities in the first environment.They can create,and they can destroy,but they cannot manipulate their own environment in any way.Also they are limited to one dimension and one frequency,which is similar to you in your physical condition.A final limitation is that they have to work and exist as a multiple,that is,for every one of you,for instance,there are four to five of them. ME:But we can incarnate in up to twelve physical vehicles at the same time!(I had received this in a previous short meditation.It was another use of the number twelve). SE2:That is true in your case,but I have not worked in the same way as your Source Entity.Also,whereas you may incarnate in twelve separate vehicles in as many different dimensions or universes,they are restricted to being in the same universe and in the same locale.Even more restricting is the fact that they must work together to experience their experiences and work towards their evolution as a group,even though they are not what you would call a"group soul." ME:So are they spread out into different civilizations:a group here,a group there,some populating a planet,some populating a galaxy.Does one group communicate with another group who has decided to exist in another neighboring planet,solar system or galaxy? SE2:A lot of questions in one sentence. ME:Sorry. SE2:First,let me give you a bit more of the picture in this environment.Although in the physical sense it is equivalent in volume to the first,it is not equivalent in dimensionality, which also affects the physical.Do I make sense here as this may seem like nonsense to you? ME:Carry on;I think I know what you mean. SE2:You may,but I will explain for the wider audience.You are fortunate to have a multi-dimensional multiverse to work with;the beings in my second environment do not.As a result,they do not have access to the physical levels that are above the physical levels where you currently exist.Thus,in effect they are limited to the physicality of the environment they exist within.They cannot go above or below it.I know you can't go below the level that you are physically.You are at rock bottom,but you can go above.I will repeat,those in environment one can't do either.You are fortunate in this way. ME:So they are captive in a certain environmental existence-one that you have created,one that they must work with. SE2:Yes,that's the deal. ME:O.K.,let's move on.Can I get back to what they have achieved as a civilization? SE2:Of course.You have to recognize though that the clues that you use in your physical existence to define a civilization and what it needs to do to be,is entirely different to what this race would consider civilization. ME:How do you mean? SE2:You may consider some of the actions they take to be that of an underdeveloped world. ME:Are you trying to tell me that they are savages? SE2:No they are not,at least not in the sense that you think.You see,their civilization is very, very basic.They are limited to a level of frequency that you would call energetic,but they would consider it physical. ME:Why would they consider it physical if we consider it energetic?

SE2:Because they have adopted a form that is impervious to them-that is,they can feel total resistance to their surroundings,themselves,and between themselves.I can see that you are frowning;you are thinking that this means that they are no different than you in your environment,am I correct? ME:You are correct.I would have thought that they would need to be incarnate to be "physical." SE2:Physicality is an expectation that you have that is based upon your current level of experience.You have a similar level of expectation for the registration and recognition of events that are individual and personal to the entity and its surroundings.You call it "time." Know this:everything in this second environment is energetic but has what you would call a "physical"aspect to it.This is not to say that these entities are subject to the same levels of limitation that you are;they are not.They can create structures in/on the areas that they focus on-that is,where in their universe they tend to be or like to be when they are together in groups made up of groups where they experience existence.Remember that is multiples of the groups of four or five that they are part of in their sphere of evolution and experience. They can use these structures for recreation,learning,or sharing of experiences.The area where you may call them uncivilized comes into play when one or two of the group,or even a whole group,are not progressing.In this instance,they are "cast outside"the group or groups that are at the same evolutionary or experience level.They are cast out to fend for themselves;they are not let back into the group or groups. ME:You say they are cast out!Is this forever? SE2:Yes,it is.Although they may form groups that are made up of other cast-outs.

ME:Hold on.I have just got agrip on what you are saying here.You have entities that are cast out of their prime evolutionary environment simply because they are not considered to be progressing as well as some or all the others within a group.Is this correct? SE2:Yes. ME:That's not very spiritual,is it?I mean it's not very loving!It's not loving the entities that you have created.In fact,from where I am sitting,it looks and feels very draconian to me. SE:This is one of the things that you will have to get used to when dealing with the other Source Entities.That is,they may and will use very different methods of progression and evolution than those which you are experiencing in my environment. ME:O.K.,sorry.I was expecting to see everything that comes from the Origin as being in love and light and full of fluffy pink bunnies. SE2:I see where you are coming from now.Do you want me to filter my communication with you and only give you that which falls within the category that you expect? ME:No,no.That would not give the correct picture to the seekers of true truth. SE2:O.K.,let me explain this "casting out"process in a different way as I can see that this has disturbed you significantly. ME:Go ahead. SE2:Perhaps you have read something into the use of the word "cast out"that is not intentional. ME:Possibly,you do have to work with my very limited communication abilities.

SE2:Yes,I am finding it a challenge.Nevertheless,I will continue with my communication with you.Those entities that are cast out leave the group both at the request of the group and under their own volition.Both the group and the entity not progressing realize that the best thing for both parties is to become separate.This allows them both to progress at their own rate.It is a most efficient method.You must understand this in a different way; in your multiverse,you are singular in your evolution.You both succeed and are succeeded by entities that are slower and faster than you in your evolutionary progression.Your evolution is personal.You wish well of those who you pass and offer good luck to those who pass you.This is the way of your multiverse.It is similar in mine,only the entities in this particular environment operate in groups.Let me make something else also clear.The "cast out"process is also used on those entities that appear to outgrow their group.This is done so that they can find a group that is similar in progression to their own although as you can imagine,this is a rarer occurrence since the main reason for being in the group is to progress as a group and not as a singular entity. ME:You said that they were cast out forever.What do you mean by this statement then? SE2:They will never be able to return to the group that they have left,for the group has either outgrown them,or they have outgrown the group. In the instance that they have out grown the group,they have a limited opportunity for further progression in the short term since one of the first things they have to do is find a new group,which as I stated earlier is hard to do because they are far and few between. They cannot progress without a group,so they must spend the rest of their time as cast outs looking for a group that is in a similar level of progression to them.Once they have established a group that fits the bill,they have to negotiate to be allowed to enter the group ME:Why do they have to negotiate? SE2:Because in some instances they may actually reduce the progression level of the group they are joining in some small way,or they may actually increase the progression. As you can imagine,finding a group that is exactly the same in terms of their "individual progression level"as a cast out is difficult.In terms of an entity that is cast out because of lack of progression,finding a new group to work with is probably harder,especially if the entity is very slow in progression.In this instance the entity can wander the environment "group less"for millennia (in your terms).The best opportunity in this instance is creating a new group by working with other entities in a similar position.However,as previously noted,there will be a level of negotiation that goes on here as well,as one of the entities will undoubtedly be a faster "progressor"than the other,even if the progression is very minor in comparison.Joining together these two temporarily singular entities will result in one of them reducing its progression level to a point that is the mean of the two entities. This means that the lower level entity benefits in the collaboration as its level will increase creating a level of dependency between the two.Hence,the correct and formal formation of a new and recognizable group,a group of two,one that will attract other singular entities and,therefore,grow to the optimal size for the group's opportunity to progress in its evolution.So as you can see,being outcast is not such a big issue.It is a natural process of group evolution,one that is standard within this environment. ME:A few moments ago in this dialogue you mentioned groups of groups.Does this mean that groups can get together for evolutionary purposes?

SE2:Yes,of course.This is one of the primary functions of progression.Groups of similar progression levels can cluster together in just the same way as single entities cluster together to form a single group.This allows them to both share group evolutionary experiences and to work on opportunities that present themselves by allowing intergroup dynamics to take place. ME:What kind of intergroup dynamics? SE2:There are three main types of inter-group dynamics.The first type is the interaction as groups between groups with the groups working and acting as if they are one entity,which is,indeed,what they should be.The second type is two or more groups working together by allowing the single entities that make up the groups to move from one group to another at will.The groups appear to merge at the point of interaction,and doubling or trebling in size is observed whilst the dynamic is being worked on.This allows a sharing of individual experience outside the entities'normal group.The third interaction is a mixture of the two mentioned above.That is,three,four,or more groups interact both on a group basis and an individual entity basis together with the single entities moving between one or more groups outside their own main group on a regular basis.In this last interaction,a lot of evolutionary opportunities can be progressed as all the groups seem to lose their individual group identity at one point or another with completely new groups being formed at times.In this instance,both group and individual entity interaction within different group interactions happen all at the same time,which gives the visual appearance of an undulating mass of entity movement resulting in the form and the formless,the timed and the timeless, the frequency and frequency-less,the dimension and dimensionless intermingling and entwining.It is beautiful to watch. ME:It strikes me that what you have just described could also be used to described what happens on our planet,Earth,as we have interaction between individuals,families,local communities, countries,and civilizations,together with migration between them all. SE2:To some extent,yes,but in comparison to my group interaction and dynamics,your communities,countries,civilizations,etc.,are one-dimensional(1D). ME:But we are three-dimensional. SE2:Yes,but you would appear one-dimensional comparatively speaking. ME:What do you mean one-dimensional? SE2:As they are at a different base dimension and frequency to you,they are naturally more expansive even though they have physicality between themselves.So,by referring to you (the human race)as being one-dimensional,I am trying to illustrate your limitations in comparison to theirs.For example,if they were to present themselves into your universe, galaxy,dimension,and frequency,you would not be able to detect them even with your sensing machines because your machines are not calibrated to sense the essence of their physicality,which to you is not physical. 

### Environment 3-An Environment for Change 

ME:I would like to talk about the third environment you have created.How is this different than the first two?

SE2:Environment 1 is closed to all but those entities that exist within it.As previously stated,they have the same abilities("power"if you want to call it that)as I do.They cannot return to their Source,me. Environment 2 has one dimension and one frequency,and although the entities can return to me at any time,they must work and evolve in groups or groups of groups.They exist in a finer density than humankind. Environment 3 is different again.It is what you call "fluidic"in nature. ME:You mean it's full of water or a liquid of some sort? SE2:No,no.By fluidic I mean that it is constantly changing. ME:In what way does it constantly change?Is it in dimension?Is it in frequency?Is it in physicality? SE2:Nearly,in fact,it changes in a way that you will have difficulty understanding. ME:Try me. SE2:O.K.It changes in rotational attractivity.I can see that you are frowning again. ME:I am a bit as I am trying to work out what that may mean.Can you describe it in layman's terms,please? SE2:Everything in this environment has a force that I call "rotational attractivity;"you might call it gravity,but it is not.In this instance,rotational attractivity is the random function that occurs in this environment that causes an entity to slip uncontrollably from one dimension or frequency to another at a specific point in its existence as a result of its natural attractivity to that dimension or frequency.By rotational attractivity,I mean that the dimensions above and below the position of the entity concerned have a rotational component that is peculiar to a certain frequency or dimension.You might call it the "speed of the energetic components"that makeup the entity. ME:How can rotation be described as speed? SE2:The associated energetic components move about and around each other.In some instances the configuration of these energies matches another environmental condition better than its current one so it is,therefore,attracted to it.If the level of attraction is compatible with enough of the energetic components of the entity concerned,it modifies the remaining components and slips into the next dimensional/frequency-based environment,that is,the one that it has been attracted to. ME:That must be a very difficult way to live. SE2:Why? ME:Because the entity that slips from one,shallI say"rotational environment"to another would have to start all over again every time it changes environments. SE2:You are thinking in terms of your own dimension and frequency again.The entities that exist in the third environment know when they are close to being moved from one type of rotational environment to another.As a result they prepare themselves for the change and work out/clear up all that they have started in their current environment.What's more, as they become more and more aligned to their next rotational existence,they get a feel of what limitations or abilities they will have.As a result and to a certain degree,they can plan ahead what they can achieve evolution-wise before they make the change. ME:But it must be like moving and losing all of your possessions,your job,and your house at the same time on a frequent basis. SE2:Not quite,for these entities don't need to work to sustain themselves.They don't need to buy food or clothing or shelter of any sort.They exist in an ever-changing environment and,as a result,they need to be independent of such restrictions. ME:So do they work by themselves,or do they work in groups like the entities in the second environment? SE2:They work on themselves for themselves,but they can and do work together with other entities for mutual advancement if they so desire.But of course,this generally only lasts for the duration that either one of them is in that rotational environment. ME:Can one entity follow another entity to another rotational environment? SE2:No,not willingly,but they can continue to work together if they detect each other later. As you can imagine,the chances of this happening is limited. ME:But not impossible I take it. SE2:No it is not impossible,but it is unlikely,especially since most of the entities plan a piece of work that is generally small enough to be contained in the shortest of existences within their current rotational environment. ME:So how would an entity know how long it has and how would it know if another entity had enough time left in their environment to make a partnership work and work to a successful conclusion? SE2:Each entity has an energetic signature that is relevant to its current rotational environment and the one that it will be slipping into.Consider it like an hour glass with sand running from one side of the glass bubble to the other through the small piece of glass that connects them.The top side of the glass is where they are now and the bottom side is where they are being attracted to next.It is this signature that every entity can sense in terms of the current rotational environment;it's just that they can't tell where their next environment will be. ME:So if I was an entity in this environment,how would I sense the longevity of the entity next to me. SE2:You would just know.I can see that statement is not enough for you. ME:No.You mentioned the hour glass as an example,but this was an example of an energetic signature.An entity must have some sort of representation,for instance,visual that makes fast recognition of longevity. SE2:Yes,there is.The best way to describe it in terms that you can understand in the physical is to say that they have a color associated with the length of time they have left in their current environment.Of course,there are a lot more colors available than those in your visible spectrum,but a good facsimile would be the change in color from the infrared to the ultraviolet.As an accurate example,it is inadequate but will do for now. ME:Simplistically speaking then,they change from red to blue,or from white to black.

SE2:If this helps you understand,then that will do. ME:What do the entities in Environment 3 work on to help them evolve,and do they have enough of them grouped together to create a civilization? SE2:I can see that you are enthralled with the need to be civilized in a way that you can recognize in the physical.No,don't answer.It is written all over your face,so to speak.I am told by your Source Entity that this is a common desire,one that you all have difficulty moving away from. Mmm,I will have to enlighten you in the simple general rules that I ask my creations to work within: Evolve through experimentation and experience. Work together where necessary. Do not create anything that could be detrimental to yourself or others. Be of service(you also have this rule to work with). Do not intentionally harm another. -It is the quality of experience that counts,not how fast you experience the experience. ME:That last rule is a really good one.It is one that we should adopt in our physical existence. SE2:If you could all embrace it,you would all benefit greatly.But,let's get back to answering your questions. My creations in the third environment are independent of the need to coalesce to exist, purely because they are not located in one place only.As with all of my creations in all of my environments,they are creatures of the universe they exist within and as such have access to all of it without exception.The only limitations they have in this sense are those that they place on themselves as part of their evolutionary plans.If enough of them are in a specific environment long enough to find that their working together in a large group is to the advantage of all,then they will group together;otherwise,they will limit their interaction to ones or twos.There will never be a group large enough to create a civilization in the sense that you know,for it is not a requirement for evolution as it is with you.In terms of what they work on,you would not understand most of it.Suffice to say,they experience things that can only be experienced by continuous change of environment and the level of attractivity it has with them. 

### Environment 4-An Environment Aware of Its Own Existence 

ME:O.K.,tell me about the fourth and final environment that you created.What limitations did you put on this universe? SE2:The fourth environment was given the opportunity to evolve on its own.That is,I did not personally create any entities specifically to exist within this environment,which is,of course,a different strategy than the one used in the creation of the other environments. ME:Hang on.Are you saying that the environment evolved on its own and created its own entities? SE2:In a word,yes,although that is not specifically how it happened.The environment itself was created and given the opportunity to become aware on its own in its own time,so to speak.It was,in essence,like me:energy given sentience/individuality whereas the other environments are just that,environments with no sentience.The sentience is given to the entities I created specifically to exist within that environment.Environment 4 was given the gift of individuality and the opportunity to evolve in its own right. ME:I'm getting the impression that you copied,for want of a better word,the Origin in this instance.The Origin gave the twelve Source Entities,you,part of its volume to give you individuality and an opportunity to evolve in your own way.In Environment 4's case,you gave it the same opportunity that the Origin gave to you,some of your own volume and the means to become aware of self and,therefore,gain a level of sentience. SE2:Correct.It is a very interesting project and one that has borne much fruit from an evolutionary perspective. ME:So how did you advise Environment 4 on its task in existence? SE2:The same way the Origin gave me my set of rules to work within.In fact,they are identical.This was the best way to proceed in this instance. ME:How long did it take Environment 4 to gain awareness? SE2:You are always referring to time;your Source Entity warned me about this trait and said that it is one of your biggest limitations. ME:Sorry,but it is one of the methods that humankind in my Source Entities'multiverse uses to differentiate between the advent of an number of events and their relationship to each other.It is also a datum that the readers of this text will use as a tool to try to understand the details of what we are discussing.

SE2:If it makes things easy for you,then I will use it although time is a non-concept.It means nothing. ME:O.K.,I understand. SE2:Yes,I believe you do at a deep down fundamental level-the level that is the real you, the energetic you,so let's move on.In creating Environment 4 in this way,I gave it essence of"me."In some respects,this helped it on its way to awareness.As a result it established its awareness quite quickly.In your metric of time,this would be about a billion years.I also noticed that the awareness coalesced in one area of denser energy where the energy distribution of the environment was irregular or uneven.In fact,the environment became aware in a type of energy that was similar in make-up. ME:I have just received an image of a dark cloud of energy within the bubble of Environment 4-that dark cloud being the energy that gained awareness first.This darker energy is still distributed throughout the volume that is Environment 4.It is just that this area was denser and thus ended up at the center of awareness. SE2:Good,that is correct.The rest of the environment also gained awareness but at a slower pace.Consider it like when you wake up from being asleep.At first you are aware of just your thoughts,and then you start to feel certain parts of your body,some before others.Finally you are in full awareness of your body,and you move your limbs at will without preconceived thought.This is exactly how Environment 4 became aware.First,it was in the center of the dark energy cloud.Then as awareness of self spread,it became more expansive and started to include the rest of the dark energy spread throughout the environmental bubble.Eventually it also included the other energies that are also present, making it a complete environmental entity in its own right-fully aware of its existence,its composition,its location,and its abilities. ME:How could it be aware of its abilities so early in its existence? SE2:As I stated before,it had essence of me,and as a result of its growing awareness, it also gained knowledge of its personal attributes and abilities.Although at this point in its existence they were fairly rudimentary,they were enough to kick-start the higher level functions of an entity that was not limited in its creative ability within the confines of what I had given it.In fact,it very quickly established what it could and couldn't do.The abilities that it couldn't perform were a function of its ability to control and work with the energies that formed its volume so to speak.So as it gained more and more understanding of self it gained more and more experience,and as a result,it expanded its creative abilities. ME:So it grew in capability as it increased in awareness. SE2:Correct.When it reached a point where it realized that it was part of a much larger entity,and,therefore,started to probe its boundaries,I decided to make my presence known and advise Environment 4 on its role in life,as it were. ME:So at this point you were able to work with Environment 4 because it was at a level of awareness that allowed it to understand what you were conveying. SE2:Yes.It needed to be at this point for a couple of reasons.First,it had to have enough awareness to allow a robust level of understanding,and second,it had to be young enough not to question its position in the universe and go off at a tangent to what I wanted to achieve.

ME:Are you suggesting that there is an optimal time period for intervention and presentation of advice on an entity's role in existence? SE2:Absolutely.Know this.If an entity is briefed on its role in existence too early in its awakening,that time during which it is becoming what it is,then it will not fully appreciate what you are telling it and will not give it the level of importance that it deserves.If on the other hand you wait too long in the awakening process,the entity develops too much independence,is likely to question the need for the role it is given,and is inclined to rebel.Although on the face of it,letting an entity experience this would be an interesting experiment to perform and observe,it is not on my agenda for evolutionary experience at this present point in my existence. ME:I have to admit I am a little bit surprised that an entity needs to be coached in this way and that there is an optimal time period in which it has to (must)be done.I would have given an entity of this size and ability more credibility. SE2:(Pause)Forgive me.I have just tapped into your memory to understand more about you and your environment.Are you O.K.with this? ME:Yes. SE2:Good,for it will help me answer your questions better.Consider a human child.If you give it too much leeway,it will not respect you.If you are too hard on it,it will consider you a tyrant.Both responses result in it holding you in contempt.This is the same for any entity. No matter how expansive and powerful it is,it is still immature.It has experienced nothing, it has learnt nothing,it has not begun its evolution,and it has no morals or understanding of what is the right thing to do and what is detrimental.Notice that I didn't say "wrong thing,'" for there is no wrong thing that can be done as everything is experience and evolution. ME:So what you are saying is that even though an entity may be as big as the fourth environment,it is still juvenile in nature. SE2:In a nutshell,yes,but don't get me wrong.The level of juvenility is completely different to what you expect and experience in your physical human existence as it would still be considered a god even by the most evolved entity within your universe. ME:O.K.,now I think I understand the need to be accurate in the point of intervention of the awakening of a new entity. SE2:I have one further thing to add.The point of intervention is also important because of the ability of the entity to absorb the information that it is going to be given.This is additional to its briefing on its role in existence. ME:What information do you give it? SE2:In Environment 4's instance,a portion of the learning that I have gained during my existence-just enough to give it a head start.I could have left it totally on its own,but that would not have been conducive to my plan.And that plan was that Environment 4 had essence of"me."In the case of other entities,I give them enough memory-based information to back up the briefing I give them.In this way they understand fully what I ask of them and are able to "hit the ground running,as you would say. ME:So if Iget this correctly,the point of intervention is a point in the early existence of the entity where it has not yet accrued its own knowledge base and as a result cannot,therefore,reject the information that you give it since it would be comparing the two sets of information all of the time. SE2:Correct.The memories that I implant need to be accepted as its own,and this cannot be done after it starts to accrue its own memories. ME:O.K.,can we move on a bit? SE2:Of course. ME:From what I can see,the fourth environment is a unique experiment.I mean,giving a whole universe sentience-that's quite a step. SE2:It's not as unique as you think.All I have done in this instance is give the energy that I call the fourth environment the essence of "me"and the opportunity to create on its own. This has been done in preference to my creation of an environment and then populating it with other smaller entities.Even with this second scenario the environment itself will at some point in its existence accrue a certain level of awareness.This is normal and to be expected,for all energy has the ability to gain awareness given enough time to stabilize, attract like energies,and grow in volume. ME:So are you saying that all energy can be sentient in some way,shape,or form? SE2:In my plan,yes,and your own Source Entity has allowed your universe to have a certain level of awareness.It's just that you don't recognize it in your current state.The only thing you need to understand is this:environments that evolve awareness and sentience are still part of the greater whole-in this instance,one of the other Source Entities or me,which are also part of the wider whole of the Origin.They never become FULLY individual to the point of separation from the originating entity.The small level of individuality that the environment gains as a result of elevating itself up to sentient status is merely localized to the energy that I or any of the other Source Entities have separated from our selves.It is a sub-section of our energy,and as a result is separate in function but whole in application. I do not lose wholeness as a result of separation.Giving an environment individuality does not reduce my wholeness for it is a process similar to what I use to create the smaller entities who populate the other environments I have created. I can see that you are frowning. The environments are like my major organs,and the smaller entities are like the cells that make up those organs.Consider it like one of your own organs-say your brain.You think that your sentience,your intellect,your individuality is centrally located in the organ you call the brain.This is not the case.In reality that part of you that is energetic is the real you,and the part that is associated with this physical vehicle is a small part of the real you.However,that part of you is associated with the whole of the physical body and not just the brain;it's just that you credit the brain with the power of individual thought when, in actuality,individual thought comes from the energetic.If you gave yourself the time to listen to the rest of your body's components,you would notice that they all have a level of intelligence.They all have individual function.Currently you recognize the personality of physical self as being the "person."You center the mind at the brain while actually the mind is the whole of you,physical and energetic,even though the physical is transient. It is the ability to recognize that the sum of the functions of the individual parts create the self.That gives an entity the understanding of the evolutionary advantage available by the creation of smaller parts of itself within itself that gives them individuality and the ability to evolve as individuals.In essence,I become more as a result of giving a part of myself individuality because personal energy given individuality remains a solid part of the whole. Your liver is individual but part of the whole.Your heart is individual but part of the whole. Your pancreas is individual but part of the whole,and your lungs are individual but part of the whole.Your physical body is an excellent example of what I describe;it is a microcosm of the macrocosm. So to simplify:giving a volume of energy the size of a universal environment individuality and sentience is no different to giving an entity of your volume of energy individuality. The subdivision of energy within energy and giving it individuality does not result in a reduction of size of the original entity.It remains part of the whole.Does this explain this concept for you? ME:Yes,it does.Thank you. Earlier in this dialogue we talked about the limitations you placed on the environments you created.What other limitations did you enforce on Environment 4? SE2:The fourth environment was also limited in physicality.By this I mean that the environment is purely energetic,and it is not possible for the entities that the environment created and that exist within it to affect each other in any way like you can,such as by touch or feel.They are like gasses mixing together but not in a way that creates a new gas. ME:How do you mean?

SE2:In the multiverse that you are part of,you can mix materials together to get what you call alloys.This you do with varying levels of ease/difficulty.You even have a gas alloy that you call air although it is made up of many constituent parts and is not a true alloy in the sense of harder materials,such as bronze or aluminium.Air is a naturally occurring alloy and is not the product of fusing together materials at the atomic level to create the new material.Air is actually a good example of the way different entities interact at the physical level without merging together to create a new entity. ME:Can you explain this a bit further? SE2:Yes of course.The entities in this environment are purely energetic.As a result,they are of a higher frequency than your physical vehicles.They all resonate in a different way.The way that they resonate is specific to each of them as individuals;as a result,they are not able to increase or decrease their frequency to a level where they are in synchronicity with another entity. ME:So you could say that they have their own signature. SE2:No,individual entity signature and resonant frequency are different things in this environment although I can see where you are coming from.This can and does work well in your home environment.However,this is not the case in this environment as the limitations imposed upon it dictate that this is not possible.An entity's resonant frequency is a product of its basic makeup.Each individual entity has a unique resonant frequency,but this is not what is used to distinguish themselves one from another,for they are not aware of their own frequency as such.They use a method of pulsing-what you call "light".

ME:Oh,that's interesting.We can see light with our physical eyes. SE2:But you wouldn't be able to see this light,for it is of a completely different nature.You have light at two ends of your physical visible spectrum,do you not? ME:Yes,we call it ultraviolet and infrared. SE2:And you cannot see any of their wavelengths with your physical eyes. ME:No,but we can detect it with our instruments.We can also see infrared light if we use the view finder or display of a digital camera,as the couple charge devices(CCD Array)that the camera uses to detect the different light frequencies and luminance levels are sensitive to wavelengths that we cannot see with our physical eyes but are nevertheless presented back to the observer via the digital camera's screen.It is detected,so it is interpreted and displayed. SE2:Well,if you had a CCD array that was sensitive to frequencies above 200,000 of what you call nano-meters,you might be able to detect the light that the entities in Environment 4 use to differentiate one another. ME:Do they use this high frequency light as a language? SE2:They can but choose not to,for that is a method of communication that is as inefficient as the pushing air across that part of your body that you call the vocal cords to create a different frequency of that air,resulting in different sounds you call "words"-a most inefficient method of communication if I have ever experienced one.The use of light to communicate is just as inefficient. ME:But it would travel at the speed of light!

SE2:The speed of light is variable and not the constant that you think it is,for it is dependent upon the overlying frequency of its environment or universe. ME:How can this be?I thought that light is one of the physical constants that we can rely on. SE2:Is light not based upon a particle,the photon? ME:Yes. SE2:Does it not have weight and a resonant frequency as a particle? ME:You would have to ask a physicist on that one,but I guess that it does. SE2:Well,the answer is that it does and as a result of this,it is easily affected by the frequentic changes within its environment.It is also affected by what you call "gravity"and“magnetic fields." ME:I have just received information to suggest that this causes distortion in the information that is transmitted using light. SE2:Well done!Yes,it does.Also,the entities within Environment 4 are by their very nature quite a distance apart physically and spatially with some being many billions of what you call "light years away."As a result of this,they need a method of communication that isn't limited by physical constraints,such as distance,speed,weight,and frequency. ME:So what do they use?Telepathy? SE2:A form of telepathy,yes,although they are capable of much more than communication based upon thought.This is because they are still part of Environment 4 and do not have full independence or singularity.

ME:I am having difficulty understanding what you are transmitting to me.I know that you have just sent me the answer,but I have nothing to compare it with.In fact,just thinking about what to compare it with is making me very tired. SE2:Yes,I understand.That is because you are trying to stretch your perception beyond me and communicate directly with that part of the fourth environment that is occupied with these entities.The communication medium that you are receiving would be best described as similar to your "surround sound"but for another medium,not for sound,for this is also slow. At this point I needed to break off for a rest as the concentration was intense.I returned a couple of hours later with renewed vigor. ME:Ah,I get it now.They have many channels of communication,and they use the environment itself as the basis for that communication.This has the effect of a single entity talking to itself.They,therefore,don't communicate as single entities when they communicate.They communicate as a whole.They are the environment. SE2:Good,good.Now you are aligned with the appropriate frequency to receive higher levels of information-information that is totally alien to you. ME:I also get the impression that all of the entities that populate the four environments you have created are energetic in nature and do not need to exist in the presence of a planet,star,or any other larger body? SE2:As you see it,the physical body is a peculiarity of your universe.In general,the projection of self to such depths of frequency is not a prerequisite for progressing evolution.

As you rightly noted,all my entities are energy-based all of the time,and the entities that Environment 4 created are no exception to this.In fact,I have one thing to note.None of my entities have experienced existence at the frequencies you have.In this you are unique,even within your own universe,for other physical entities are a much higher frequency. ME:Do the entities in Environment 4 have any planets to live on? SE2:No,they live in free space so to speak.They have no need for a focal point within which to exist,for they already have one-the environment that created them. ME:I would find it hard to interact with them as most of our interaction in the physical relies on the ability to see,touch,and hear each other.From what you have explained to me,they are not able to do or use any of these senses. SE2:And they would find it difficult to use them as well.Remember,these entities are the product of the individual thought of an environment,not me and as a result they are subject to variation upon what would be expected from the short sortie you have made into the other three environments I created.The entities in the fourth environment are constrained by their physicality not their "physicalness,"their makeup,which is to you energetic in nature.They are able to work with each other and the environment that created them.They are able to maintain their individuality whilst being blending together,they can communicate in a most efficient and instantaneous manner,they are the children of one of my greater creations and of this I am pleased. I suddenly sensed that this was the end of my communication with Source Entity 2.It was gone from my mind,and I felt empty,I felt that I could function again without feeling that the walls were closing in around me-a feeling that must have been due to the sheer volume of information that I was receiving and having to filter down to text in my computer.This was my first communication with another Source Entity-a Source Entity that was not my creator.Although we had discussed its work and achievements over the last few weeks,I felt that I hadn't even scratched the surface,that I had gained nothing.I found myself asking the age-old question of whether or not it was all worthwhile when my own Source Entity cut in. SE:You are disappointed. ME:I expected to get more information than this.I expected to get down to the sort of level where I could ask what kind of civilizations were in SE2's environments,what they have achieved,what they have created,even what car they drive (if they had a car). SE:You would never be able to assimilate that level of data from a foreign Source Entity. Indeed,it is not possible to go to that depth with me and some of my other groups of entities,for there is simply too much detail.Consider how you would explain 21st century technology and life to a 17th century person.You couldn't do that in any detail that would be understandable simply because the language is not there,and language/understanding is the limiting factor here.Let me tell you this.These limited dialogues that you have with me,my peers,and,indeed,the Origin are enough to whet the appetite of any seeker of truth.They are by their very nature an overview of what is out there in the greater reality, and an overview is all that mankind in its current state can cope with right now.Do not be disappointed,my friend,for you break new ground.Enough is enough,and the detail in these short dialogues is more than enough to be getting on with.You will be communicating with Source Entity Three next,and you will need to shift your energies to a different level than you have currently experienced to achieve communication.For this you will need to rest and purify yourself,for SE3 is pure of heart and energy.

## Chapter 3 - Source Entity Three 

I have to admit that at this point in the game I am feeling a little worried.I feel that the information that I have already received as a result of my communications with the first two Source Entities is very high level and not of enough detail to be ofimportance.I also feel that it is diverse enough to cover most of what I could possibly expect.In fact,I can't possibly think what would come out of dialogue with the other Source Entities that would be enough to create a robust piece of work that is of interest to the spiritual public.It is a real dichotomy. The feeling is a little bit akin to writer's block,except that it is "channeler's block,"or is it? It could be that the task at hand is so large that I am daunted by it to the point of inactivity, of mental seizure,of doubt.I am also worried that the details that I have taken down are the result of a vivid imagination,that I am not in contact with other Source Entities,and that I am,in effect,just talking to myself.As I type these words,my fears are being put to one side specifically because now I feel that I have already made a mental link with Source Entity Three(SE3)to the point where I have a mental image of what it looks like.Also,my own Source Entity is here with me and has a few words of comfort and help. ME:I feel that I can't carry on with this,that I can't conjure up enough diversity of information to justify the goal of having a chapter on each Source Entity. SE:Be calm.It does not matter how many words you receive on each Source Entity.What matters is that you contact them,and you open your heart to them.You are thinking that you have to create the text yourself and that you can't possibly have enough diversity of creative thought to create new dialogue of the length you have already achieved.This is your ego talking to you.You will be given the information;you will not have to invent it.Your fears are borne out of self-created objectives.Your personal objectives are not important. What will be,will be.Remember what one of your old managers said to you once:bite your elephant in bite-size chunks.You don't have to do it all in one go.There are no time constraints.There are no limitations. The information is and must be high level.As I stated at the end of our dialogue with Source Entity Two,you can't possibly go down to the minute detail that you wish.You simply don't have enough capacity in your current physical state,and your readers would not appreciate this level of detail either.You are more likely to bore the pants off them! I was about to say that this is a bit of a backward step for you,but I have just looked into your mind and now understand what the issue is.It is not fear of being able to meet your objective of 12,000 words per Source Entity or your worry about the information being diverse enough to be credible. ME:So what is it then? SE:You are trying to access too much at the same time.As a result,you don't know which way to look first.You are like a deer in the headlights of a car.No,wait a minute.You are accessing ALL the Source Entities at the same time,and you are close to information overload.No wonder you are feeling like you can't do anything.You are full to the point of bursting.Re-calibrate your awareness to me and Source Entity Three only.This will help.

### Initial Contact with Source Entity Three-Blissful! 

I took the advice of my Source Entity.I mentally told myself that I would only receive information from my own Source Entity and Source Entity Three.The effect was remarkable.I suddenly felt lighter,cleaner,open.All of my fears about what I was doing left me,and the fog cleared from my mind.I must be careful not to open myself too much again, or I must train myself to accept the increase in information. At this point I found myself logging into Source Entity Three.Again I saw the image of it. I approached it from the perspective of the Origin,looking inward and downward to see its appearance and location within the Origin.The initial impression I received was that of an amorphous white ball that undulated.It felt warm,comforting,even welcoming.It was a delight to be in its presence.What's more it was pleased to sense me and invited me inside itself.It felt pure.It was pure.It was pure of heart,just like my Source Entity told me.I was in a state of bliss,one I had not experienced in communications with my own Source Entity. I opened a dialogue. ME:Wow,it feels totally euphoric!It's a very heady feeling.Why is this? SE3:What you are feeling is the result of the work that I am doing.Within your own Source Entity's environments,you are allowed to experience different levels of"-ivity." ME:-ivity? SE3:-ivity.You see them in two basic ways though:positivity and negativity.In my experiment and in all of the environments that I have created,there is no such thing as negativity.I can see that you are about to ask a question.

ME:Yes,my own Source Entity says there is no such thing as a negative experience.There is only experience. SE3:Yes,that is true,but in my environments there can be no experience that can be classified as bad,detrimental,or horrible.Everything is delightful;every entity works in harmony in everything it does. ME:Ifind this a bit hard to take on-board.How can everything be done in a state of bliss? SE3:In comparison with your current existence,everything in the Origin's multiverse is experienced in a state of bliss.That which is not in bliss is generally of such a low frequency that it is unbearable. ME:Are you suggesting that bliss is a state of frequency? SE3:No,but it is a component part of it.An entity that is in a state of bliss is usually of a high frequency. ME:So why would you want to create a universe where its entities are only able to experience positive blissful things? SE3:Quite simply,to see what happens.One of the things you will notice in your dialogues with the Source Entities is that each of us is doing things its way.Sometimes there is an overlap in what we do,and sometimes we are poles,even multiverses,apart.Where we overlap,we compare and contrast what we did and how we arrived at the condition,what the route was,what the circumstances were,and what the incumbent entity's contribution was that resulted in that end result.Where we do not overlap,we share our learning and add it to the total reservoir of evolutionary data that we create.Why shouldn't I have an experiment where every entity that exists within an environment is in blissful harmony? ME:Well,I would consider that it limits the experience opportunity. SE3:It does,and that is the point. Let me make it easier for you.Although you would think that you are limiting the evolutionary opportunities of an entity or environment by initiating such limitations,what you are actually doing is opening up an opportunity to focus on an aspect of existence to a greater depth of detail.To some extent,this is what you are doing now in your physical,low frequency existence.The objective of the experience and resultant evolutionary opportunity is not just in the quantity of things that you experience,it is also in the quality of what you experience.To achieve this,you must limit your options.To put it in a nutshell,as you might say,the entities in my environments are to experience existence in a state of bliss or positivity in every which way they can and as much as they can. ME:My own Source Entity said that you are "Pure of Heart."I have an understanding of what that means from my own sense,but can you tell me what your understanding is? SE3:Simply put,it is the way I do business in my environments.What do I mean by this? ME:I don't know.Maybe it is that you do not stray off the beaten track.You stick to your strategy that you cannot be corrupted in any way by any of the things that your creations do,and you expect the same from your creations. SE3:Good try.In my instance,being pure of heart is that I only have the best intentions in mind and only want the best for my creations and their experiences.That is why I limited their environment to the higher frequency levels:those levels that result in the condition you call“bliss.”ME:What does it feel like to live continually in this bliss state that you have created for your creations? SE3:I can only explain it from your perspective. It would be like being in a continuous state of well-being,good cheer,and good humor. You would not have any ailments,worries,or concerns.Everything is understood and understandable.Everything is achieved and achievable.Anything that the individual does is for the good of all,including the environment.Nothing is detrimental.Nothing detrimental can be or is desired to be done.No one does anything just for self.Everything is done in love and light. ME:Whilst you were describing this,I started to experience it.I felt like I was in a cloud of light that I was free of any restrictions and constraints.Ifelt FREE in every sense of the word. SE3:Even though my entities are constrained to only experiencing the bliss state,the level of freedom from your perspective is infinite. ME:It felt like I was everywhere all at the same time-in communication with all things and everything all at the same time.Being restricted to the bliss state does not seem like a restriction to me.It seems like a delight,an honor,something to be cherished. SE3:Ah.You have hit the secret of remaining in bliss on the head.You in your condition can only remain in the bliss state if you understand at the most fundamental level that it is something special,something to be cherished,something to be shared.

ME:And this is how your entities feel all of the time that they are in existence? 

SE3:Yes,and they are in existence for as long as I require them to be.Don't get the wrong impression here.I don't create entities and then destroy them or remove sentience from them.Like your Source Entity,I could remove them from existence at any time,but I don't. There is no need to,for in real terms I have just started the work that I wanted to do. 

### Source Entity Three's Environmental Dimensionality 

ME:O.K.,I would like to ask a standard question that I plan to ask all of the Source Entities that is about the environment/s that you have created.What are they like? SE3:In variance to the multiple layer/dimension environments that the first two Source Entities created,I only created one.If you are observant,this is similar to one of the environments that Source Entity Two created.All of the entities that I have created exist and work within this environment.If I was to illustrate the dimensional mathematics to you,it would look like this:12x1x12x3.That's 432 dimensions. ME:That looks like a similar representation to that given by the first two Source Entities.What I mean is that it is a multiple of twelve and three. SE3:Correct.I am told that you have already been educated in the mechanics of the rules for dimensional construct by your own Source Entity. ME:That's right.It is within the text of my first publication. SE3:Then I will not bore you with similar details.Suffice to say,there are rules that we have to follow for creating dimensional constructs or environments for existence.Those rules are based upon the way that the Origin is constructed-hence,the use of three base dimensions to start the construction of a single dimensional environment at the lowest level and the multiplication of those dimensions by twelve levels,not forgetting the frequencies that exist within the dimensions. ME:When my own Source Entity created us,he said that he had a lapse of concentration that resulted in some of the entities being created had a lower level of ability than others.These are used to look after the universe that it created and are allowed to incarnate into simpler physical vehicles for their own evolution.What happened when you created your entities?How did you create them? SE3:The process for creating a sentient entity is the same for all Source Entities.It is also the same as that used by the Origin to create us.The creating entity must identify and segregate that part of itself energetically that it wants to use as the medium for creating the entities concerned.Please note this.We cannot create something out of nothing-specifically if it is to have its own sentience.For if nothing exists,then there is nothing to work with.A void without energy of any kind remains a void.In this respect,we must give up part of our own energy,energy with sentience,to create that which requires its own sentience.These creations remain part of us,contained within us but separate from us. The lack of concentration by your own Source Entity resulting in entities of lesser faculty was a result of its own lack of interest in the process once it had started it off.It simply became more interested in something else.The beauty of its error is that it ended up with a plethora of unexpected opportunities for evolution;opportunities that it hadn't planned for,hence its decision to keep what it ended up with.In my case I did not have such a lapse of attention and created what I wanted to create in the first place.In this instance what I created was pure and it was this level of purity that gave me the idea to restrict the universe they were to exist within to the higher frequencies of bliss,to ensure that everything remained pure.Pure of Heart therefore means that purity,or lack of error,is at the center of everything that I have created and will create. Source Entity Three's Universe At this point in the dialogue with Source Entity Three,I was aware that we had discussed very little of the nitty gritty of the subject that I like to be involved in,namely trying to understand the makeup of its universes and what the entities that exist within it were doing in order to achieve the goal of all entities created by the Origin and its Source Entities- individual evolution.I had not even merely scratched the surface of the first two Source Entities and had only ventured slightly further with my own Source Entity.I felt that I had gotten off to a slower start with this Source Entity than with the others.I was dissatisfied with my progress and was eager to move on.My own Source Entity had a few words of wisdom to help me on my way. SE:Do not be impatient with your progress,for you are dealing with energies that are totally alien to you.As a result,you will find it hard to align yourself with some of the frequencies, especially when you have been stuck in the demands of physical life.I note that you have noticed that you are drawn to the physical more than normal lately? ME:Yes,I have even found out that one of my spiritual friends has been experiencing the same. It's like we are being lured,like something is fighting back at the increase in the Earth's frequency. SE:This is exactly what is happening.Those of lower frequency are indeed fighting back.

As a result,you and others are feeling the weight of this pull you from every angle,in every relationship,and in every pastime.Thus you are finding it difficult to elevate yourself energetically and,hence,feel that you are being dragged down.Worry not,for it will pass, and you will get stronger as you come to recognize where the influences originate that cause the pull towards the lower frequencies.Concentrate on Source Entity Three,and you will be O.K.Remember that Source Entity Three is also a finer frequency than previously experienced.This will also cause you to feel a little discontented until you align your energies better. ME:Thank you for those words of encouragement. SE:It is a pleasure,for you are taking on quite a task. I then changed my attention to Source Entity Three. ME:We have talked very little about your universal environment so far,other than to explain the basics.I would like to learn more about your creations and what they are doing in the environment you have created for them.I would like to split this into a number of areas,which I will discuss separately as I am aware that I have jumped in at the deep end with you.So,first,can you tell me more about the environment you created? SE3:As I previously stated,my universe is limited to allow my smaller creations to experience nothing but the higher frequencies-what you call the bliss state.I can see though that you want to know more of the details behind it. ME:Yes,please.It would keep the dialogue similar to that already achieved with Source Entities One and Two.

SE3:Mmm.Do not preconceive what the dialogue will be,for that will lead the conversation into a direction that is adverse to what it needs to be.Remember,we are trying to give information about ourselves to humanity that it needs to know,not what you think it needs to know.Your desire to fulfil certain requirements of your own may divert you from the opportunity to access more important information. ME:O.K.,I understand,but I would still like to touch on these two main areas.Whatever happens after,I will leave up to you. SE3:Good.Now I will explain my environment and my entities and what they do in order to evolve further. As we have already discussed,my entities exist within those dimensions and frequencies relative to the bliss state.Having said this,I realize that any energetic state above your current frequency can be classified as bliss,but this is several orders of magnitude above the highest level that the human race could achieve.Indeed,what you experienced by tapping into my energies is but a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of what my entities experience. Contrary to what you might think,my entities do have areas of what you call planets, spherical constructs,and areas of local density,where they are able to work on what they are experiencing.The environment I created for them is not as multi-layered as yours because the areas of local density exist within the normal high frequencies of the environment and do not form their own environment as a result of their lower level.Everything exists within the same environment;I have no separation between dimensions and frequencies. ME:I have just received an image of a purple-yellow colored planet in an area of space that is pure white light.Our planets exist in dark lightless space. SE3:That is a result of the higher frequency of the environment.Your own physicality is bound by low vibration which is signified by the darkness of the space in-between the areas of density.My environment is not bound by low frequency,so the areas in-between are in lightness. ME:So if your creations exist in such high frequencies,why do they need areas of local density to work out their evolutionary tasks? SE3:They don't as such.It's just that some of them like to associate themselves with an object of density.Don't get me wrong here.When I say density,I mean areas where there are energies that stick together out of creation not by what you would call "molecular attraction."These areas are created and,in most instances,can be given individuality. Planets Created by Smaller Entities ME:Our planets have individuality! SE3:Your planets are collective individuals;they are the creations of the galaxies and are, therefore,facets of the galactic mind.These are not.They are either fully separate or are lacking individuality altogether. ME:So planets in this environment...can I continue to call them planets? SE3:Yes,it will suffice as an explanation although it is not entirely correct as I will explain later.

ME:[Planets]are created by the entities that live in your bliss-based environment as a method of providing some level of focus on a certain evolution-based project.They are "similar energies" that are bound together to create an object of sufficient size to allow any number of entities to co-exist/work together on evolving.Indeed,the planet or energetic construct could,in fact,be the project itself. SE3:Not bad.But note this:the planet or planets are created by the entities but not larger entities,such as in your galaxies.Also,they are not generally spherical as they are in your physicality for they are not created by molecular attractivity.They can be and are any shape, frequency,dimension,or a mixture of all.They can be used as housing,workshops,or as something created for pure pleasure.Some of the entities even create entities to live on/in these constructs.They do this to see how smaller versions of themselves manage on their own. ME:This seems a bit like life on the Earth. SE3:Theoretically speaking,it does have a certain similarity,but in essence it is not because they are not dealing with the same levels of discontinuity of self-this being your projections into the lowest physicality you can find and almost separate from your totality as a result.They create new entities from the surrounding energy;they do not separate themselves to create new entities. ME:Hold on.I thought that all entities with sentience were created by separation of the larger entity to create the smaller.This is how the Origin created you and the other Source Entities.In fact,I distinctly remember being told this by Source Entity Two.

SE3:This is correct.But note that you have used the word "sentience."The rule that you have stated is to do with the creation of sentient beings.The entities being created by my entities are more akin to what you would call astral entities.These are energy given form with individuality but without sentience. ME:So do the planetary entities also have entities to exist in or within them? 

SE3:They do,but they are similar in function to those you have on Earth to maintain it. You would call them nature spirits.In essence,they are not anything like the nature spirits your planet has,for they have limited function,ability,and longevity.They are created to perform a function and when that function is completed,they return to the core energy that they were created from.They are like tools in a box,so to speak,but with the box being full of "manipulatable"energy only,not specialized tools.The maintenance of the planetary construct is relative to its ability to withstand evolutionary pressure,so the nature spirits created are made in order to modify the planet to allow it to cope with/adapt to the demands of the creating entities using the planet. 

### An Area of Local Density 

SE3:Now,let me tell you something about these planets.Your current expectation is to see a spherical shape for a planet or,indeed,a star.Although this is a common,natural shape in the physical and energetic environments created by your Source Entity,it is not a necessary requirement.Many of my creations have created areas of local density of any shape that you could know or think of.In fact,to use the word "shape"would only lead you astray in your process of understanding;you would "go off at a tangent,"so to speak.

ME:So what does a planet or area of local density look like in your environment? SE3:It does not necessarily need to look like anything.Most of them just are what they are:areas of local density where there is more energy of a certain type and frequency than any other.A planet does not need to be a physical solid to be useful in evolution.Just take your largest planet,Jupiter.It mostly exists in a frequency that you are not aware of yet and houses many energetic entities.What you see in the physical is merely a shadow of its totality.So with this in mind,I will try to describe a typical planetary construct in my environment. First,here's a correlation with your own area of local density,Earth.Your Earth is quite unique in your universe/multiverse environment,for it has both energetic entities and physical entities to maintain its function.Your nature spirits work on the higher frequency levels,and all kinds of your plants and animals work on maintaining the lower frequency levels.On planets in my environment,we have only the energetic entities because there is no need for maintenance at such low levels.Don't forget each of your animals has a maintenance-based function to perform on your Earth.So as one form becomes extinct,the function that it performs is lost and the resulting level of maintenance is diluted in this area. Because none of my creations have created a planet that is so low in frequency,there is no need for such lower frequency levels of maintenance;therefore,we have no animals.That is not to say that the creating entities do not have a desire to create smaller entities to fill the spaces available in their planetary creation,for they do so for their own pleasure. A typical construct does not have or need physicality,and so it does not have one.You might want to use the construction of your own clouds as an example you can relate to for this is how they would be perceived if they could be seen by your physical eyes. Within the construct,which would be similar in size to two of your suns,the entities create further constructs and discuss their relevance within the work they are doing to help their evolution.These constructs have a function and form that is relevant to the work they are created for. ME:So do they create things like houses,tools,and transportation just like us? 

SE3:No,they have no need for transportation systems or places of shelter.The constructs that they make are for helping other entities evolve. 

ME:Hang on a moment.There are other entities than those you created to exist in this environment? SE3:Yes,of course.They are created as part of the initial environment. ME:What?Now I am confused.Please help me out here as I am starting to lose the thread of the direction of our conversation. 

SE3:There is a general rule that all the Source Entities use when creating:an entity can create other entities for evolutionary purposes,but if that entity is to have sentience and individuality,it must come from the energy of the creating entity.On the other hand,if that entity is to have individuality but not sentience,then it can be created from the surrounding energy.An entity that is to have sentience but be part of a collective must also be part of the originating creator's energy.Therefore,only entities that are created by the giving up or sharing personal energy can have sentience and evolve.Some of the entities in my bliss-based environment have given up part or half of their energy,which,of course,links back to the Origin for the sole purpose of creating sentient beings that can both evolve in their own right and add to their creator's evolution.Please note that all of them are considered as equals,even though they are potentially of lesser energetic content-that is,volume not ability.They are also aware that they are created by others from their own personal energy and as such are bound by their energetic and evolutionary imprint. 

### An Evolutionary Imprint 

ME:What is an evolutionary imprint?That is a description I have never heard before. SE3:An evolutionary imprint is something that is unique to my entities.Each entity chooses a route to attain its optimum evolutionary opportunity.Call it a road map,if you like, with certain points that need to be achieved at certain points in their evolution.To get to these points,each entity needs to have achieved a certain level of experience,creativity, and responsibility.Each of these are recorded as being achieved,being experienced,being planned but not reached and in the imprint.If an entity creates an entity with the intention of giving it sentience,it then also gives it that which the creating entity has experienced and the rest of the points on the evolutionary imprint. 

ME:They get a head start in their existence above that of their creators. 

SE3:That is correct.But in doing so,the creating entity has the ability to evolve at twice the speed,as there are now two entities using the same imprint. 

### Replication,Division and Merging for Evolutionary Acceleration 

ME:So you are saying that the original entities that you created are also able to create sentient entities for the purposes of their own evolution?

SE3:In a nutshell,yes.But do not think that this is unusual,for you also create sentient beings,do you not? ME:You mean we couple together to breed new human beings in order to replace ourselves and increase the population so that more souls can incarnate? SE3:Yes.And do you not evolve are a result of the interaction between yourselves as parents and the smaller beings you call children? ME:I suppose we do,yes,but we also accrue karma points as a result.It is a double edged sword with us humans re-creating ourselves the way we do.It's a slow process and relies on us, in general,being dedicated to those that we give physical life to for the rest of our physical lives. Some people abuse this privilege whereas others are model children,parents,and grandparents. SE3:I have just experienced what you are talking about through your memories.I will say that those that are created are created instantaneously and do not have to go through such long-winded processes.Those that are created with the evolutionary imprint are party to all knowledge and experience immediately upon creation. ME:So they are clones,direct copies of the creators? SE3:They are not direct copies,for they are not able to create from the division of themselves;therefore,they cannot create sentient beings.They can create non-sentient individual beings,but as I have previously explained,they are made of energy that is available within the surrounding areas. ME:O.K.,so what do these copies do to evolve and help their creators evolve?

SE3:They do what they feel is required to evolve.It is entirely possible for a creating entity to create many,many copies of itself in order to accelerate its evolution. ME:Up to how many can they create?There must be a limit so they avoid diluting themselves too much. SE3:Correct observation.There is an upper limit where they create before they lose their energetic majority.This is dependent upon the original energetic content of the creating entity,for not all entities are ofequal content.This is mainly to do with the merging together of entities to create a bigger creating entity.I will describe this further in a moment.Suffice to say,an entity has a generally accepted upper limit of around one hundred copies of itself before it starts to lose its cohesion as a creating entity. ME:So what happens to an entity that exceeds this number? SE3:It becomes as one with their creations and loses the ability to re-create itself in this way.Also,by default,it then creates a collective.Some entities elect to do this as part of their evolution whereas others elect to merge themselves with another creating entity to create a new collective-in this instance,a single individual entity of greater power if you want to call it that. ME:So why would entities want to merge together whilst others want to diversify to the point of loss of creativity? SE3:Simply to evolve in a different way than the other entities they were created with. ME:So an entity may decide to either divide itself up to the point of dilution of own ability to experience evolution as a supposedly lesser entity but still be collectively connected to those entities that it created,or it can merge with others to create a bigger more powerful being of combined experience,knowledge,evolution,and evolutionary imprint. SE3:Yes. ME:Can the entity that has split itself into the level that it loses its creativity,entity-wise,reverse this process? SE3:Once the process has been initiated,it cannot be reversed,that is,not by the will of the original entity on its own.Remember:the creating entity has created a high number of "sentient"entities.It cannot of its own violation remove their individuality or sentience,for this would be akin to killing that entity.It can,however,merge with a willing entity to create an entity of greater "creator"energy and,therefore,reinstate its position-that position being relative to the number of entities that elect to merge with the original of a creating entity.They cannot merge themselves to create a bigger more powerful entity;this can only be done with the original creating entity and the desire of one or more "created"entities to return to their source. Returning to the Creating Entity ME:Do they lose their individuality when they return to their creator?This is one of the things that we all ask in the physical world of our creator,Source Entity One.In our instance,we still retain individuality but are a fully functioning part of Source Entity One.We can even leave the Source at will if required/requested in order to provide additional evolutionary opportunities. SE3:Yes,but this is understood by the returning entity.They know that they came from nothing,as indeed we all do since we are all ultimately creations of the Origin.However, they are also aware that once they have been created,they can be re-created by the creating entity in totality at a later date after they decide to return to their creator. ME:So does this happen a lot?Do entities elect to return to their creator,complete in the knowledge that they will no longer have individuality? SE3:This happens on a regular basis and is a direct result of the type of evolutionary work done by that entity.In essence,they become specialized in evolving within certain types of experience.Once they have evolved as a result of the work they have done within the experiential environment,they may then elect to become part of the whole again.However, when the creating entity needs to evolve in an area that would be best supported by that part of itself that was of optimal evolution in the proposed experiential environment,it re-creates that entity even at the potential expense of it losing its creating functions.The object here is not the concern over the loss of individuality but taking every opportunity that presents itself to evolve and working with it.This is something that you humans could learn.In their eyes,evolutionary progression is the number one priority;they have no concept of personal loss of individuality.This is one of the facets of existence in the levels of frequency that they exist in. ME:So the entities that are created by the creating entities are,in effect,entities that are created as tools for maximizing evolutionary opportunities whenever they arise.They are facets of themselves that are experienced in evolving in certain conditions and are created specifically to maximize that opportunity.They are given sentience and individuality to allow them to function in a fully autonomous way,maximizing the evolutionary opportunity.This is why they have the evolutionary imprint.They function exactly as the original creating individual,and the only difference is that they are focused upon the task that they were created for.That is why the original entity evolves at the same time as the created entity.Although they are separate, they are one and the same.They are like,for example,twenty entities experiencing twenty different evolutionary opportunities all at the same time-thus allowing the creating entity the opportunity to evolve at twenty times the speed that it could on its own. SE3:Correct.This is a good analogy and is the reason why the created entities have no qualm about returning to their creator and losing their individuality as a result.It's also the reason why the creating entity has no issue with losing its creative ability and becoming one and the same with its creations,albeit temporarily,because it knows that at some point one of the entities it has created will need to return to it because it will have finished its job. ME:But hold on.You said that the created entities elected to return to their creators earlier.This tells me that they have some level of free will on electing to return,and when they complete their job,they may actually elect to not return to their creator. SE3:This is,in fact,a decision that they may elect to take.However,they must have a valid reason for not returning to their creator. ME:So what constitutes a reason not to return to the creating entity when the created entity has clearly finished its job,evolved,and in the process pushed the creating entity up the evolutionary ladder? SE3:As part of the finalization of the existence of the entity,it needs to review what it has done to evolve in the way it has.In that instance,if the entity sees that the level of evolution could be optimized further by taking the direction of experience into a different direction,one that is not too distant from that already experienced but different,it would be enough to warrant investigation.It may decide that it needs to investigate this route further and,therefore,extend its time in individuality in order to take advantage of this evolutionary opportunity.It does this of its own violation and does not need the permission of the creating entity.You see in this instance the created entity is doing its job correctly.It is pushing the evolution of itself and the creating entity by maximizing its existence.When eventually all of the avenues of opportunity are taken,the entity will then consider that it has maximized its reason for individual existence and will elect to return to its creator. ME:So how often does a creating entity reach the stage where it is in the state that it is equal with its creations,and how long could it stay in that condition? SE3:I would say that almost every one of the creating entities has been in this state at least three or four times.Indeed,some of them have been in this condition ten or twenty times. You have to understand that these entities have been in existence for almost as long as I have and,therefore,have had many opportunities to evolve.How long they have been in this condition varies from entity to entity and how many of their creations are close to finishing their work.I will check on the imprints of my entities.(Pause) Some have experienced equality for as little as 25 minutes whereas many others have experienced this condition for many millennia;it just depends on the timing of the creation of their entities.A good average would be in excess of 300-400 of your years. ME:You just mentioned that almost all of the creating entities experienced this condition.This implies that there are those that haven't.

SE3:You are right.There are a handful of entities that have not reached that level of dilution. This is not an issue for they have experienced the evolution that they expected to achieve in their evolution imprint. ME:You also stated earlier that some entities merged together to create a larger entity.What is the reasoning for this?I thought that they were pretty powerful in their normal state? SE3:Although the creating entities are powerful in their own right,they gain additional facilities as a result of their merging together.In variance to the re-merging together of created entities were the created entities that lose individuality when returning to the creating entity.When they merge together,they do not lose their individuality even though they are,for all intents and purposes,a single entity. ME:So what is the benefit of their merging then? SE3:Enhanced creativity which enhances their evolutionary opportunities.I see that this is not a good enough answer for you,so I will elaborate further.Creating entities that merge together in-I will use a word in your mind-coadunation,increase their capacity for creativity to a level that none of them could achieve on their own even in collaboration.In merged groups of three or four entities and above,they can create their own universes and act as a Source Entity might in terms of its level of creativity and resulting responsibility. This can only be achieved in numbers merging above two since three and above creates a critical mass that allows certain Source Entity energies to be available. ME:Do you have many creating entities merging?

SE3:It is one of the most popular ways of enhancing evolution,especially when some of the creating entities elect to work within the universe/s that some of these merged entities create. ME:Do any of these entities remove themselves from this merged state?I can imagine that once an entity has experienced a level of creativity and responsibility consistent with the number of entities merged together that allows the integration of Source Entity energy,they would not want to return to a level that is,to my mind,fairly mediocre in comparison. SE3:You forget that these entities already exist in a fine frequency level,a bliss state,so they are not disenfranchised too much when they remove themselves from the merge.They have grown as a result of the merge and the energies involved and are "bigger"as a result. Suffice to say,I have only had two groups dissolve their merge to date and less than twenty individuals remove themselves from a merge greater than two.You may actually have a point here,but I...I will just scan them.(Pause)No,none of those who are still in a merged existence are only in that existence through fear of loss of ability,function,or power. 

### A Comparison with Source Entity One's Multiverse 

ME:One of the things I would like to ask is how similar is life,energetically and physically,in our multiverse compared to your own? SE3:You need to understand that there can be no comparison with your universe's environment-at least not in the sense that you would want a comparison to be made. As I've previously explained,the reason for this is due to the high frequency level of my universal environment.I can see that you are already about to ask another question,one where you think we may be able to make a comparison.Is this not correct? ME:Yes,I was thinking that we could compare the structure of your universe with that of Source Entity One's. SE3:First,your source Entity has created myriad different universes,which you call a multiverse.I chose not to go down this route as this was not what I wanted to do.As I have previously stated,I created a single universal environment of high frequency of an equally high dimensional status.Within this I have created one race of beings to populate it,each pre-programmed (as you are)with the need to evolve through experience.As my creations are all part of the same frequency base as their environment,they are subject to the limitations of that frequency.In my universe I also have one operational dimension; this dimension is singular in expression but high enough not to need the support of other dimensions to keep it in its position.If I were to compare its position with your dimensions, it would be in the 14-15th dimensional position.Bear in mind that you do not actually have a dimension of such a high status.In your multiverse,you have but twelve real levels within which all your other dimensions or dimensional phases exist. ME:My Source Entity told me that it had 12x12x12x3 dimensions.Are you saying that this is not true? SE3:It is true,but you have to consider that Source Entity One's dimensions are nested. It has created dimensions within dimensions,each of them padded out with a frequency base.My dimension is not nested and,therefore,allows an entity to access its volumetric opportunities in entirety. 

ME:Help me out here.Are you suggesting that the dimension in your universe is the same size as all of the dimensions in my Source Entities multiverse? SE3:Yes.It must be.We are both the same,so whatever we create,we create within ourselves.As a result we can make things as big or as small as we like,provided they are contained within our own boundaries. ME:I find that fascinating SE3:You may,but it is one of the rules we,as Source Entities,have to follow. ME:Getting back to the comparison-if your entities are existing in a single dimension of high frequency,everything that they are in contact with must be the same because energetically speaking,they are based upon this.They must be in conflict with it at all times-like they must be stuck in the ground or a rock,so to speak. S3:You are thinking in terms of the physical environment thatthat part of you is currently experiencing. ME:I might be.I have to actually.This is the only tangible datum I have as a human being. SE3:Again,this is a physical consideration.Please understand-physics is the only known constant that can be used to describe that which is Origin,but know this:physics is not a study of the physical.It is a study of the energetic,and the energetic behaves relative to that dimension/frequency that it is part of.As a result,that which is of the same dimension or frequency is not necessarily in conflict.I will use your condition as a descriptor;it is not solid object against solid object.It is like a very rare gas mixing with a very rare gas.Of course,this is a crude example,and even the rare gas example is far too dense to be anywhere near correct,but it will suffice. ME:But aren't gases based upon differing frequency levels? SE3:No,they are based upon a different chemical composition,and a chemical composition is a physicality that is not available in my universe.Now consider that the difference in an entity and its environment is based upon energy-energy that is based upon a dimensional condition without actually needing to be part of a particular dimension-and you have the ability for that entity to have energy that is singular to its environment whilst being part of it because it exists within it.That means that the content of the universe is not opaque; it is always clear.An entity can pass through it,any part of it,at will without hindrance or resistance of any sort.I can see that you are having difficulty with this. ME:I am a bit. SE3:Well,think of it in these terms:the entity is one with the universe,and the universe is one with the entity.The only difference is that the universe has a single intelligence/ sentience of its own.Parts of it also have intelligence and sentience.These smaller parts travel around the universe by associating that part of their intelligence where they want it.This causes the loci of their energetic signature-if you want to call it that-to be relocated to that part of the universe where they wanted to be present.Hence,this gives the impression that they have moved without hindrance. ME:Why did you use the word "loci"?It is usually attributed to a number of points a fixed distance from an originating point that creates a curve or that can be related to a specific point on a curve.

SE3:That would be a good description of my entities.They have an origin point and other points where their intellect is in focus.When a particular point is in more focus than the others-that is,it has more sentience attributed to it-then it could be called the loci or locus of that entity.It is similar to that part of you that is typing this text now is the locus of that part of you that is projected into the physical of your multiverse to create you as a human being.Thus,they have a locus to indicate thatthat is the majority of them in their universe. This is how they maintain their singularity within the universe and how they can become merged-by the joining together of points of their loci-or separated by removing points of their loci. ME:O.K.,so I have established that you have created a singular universe and that it is of a high dimension and frequency.The universe has its own sentience,and it is populated with a single race of entities that have the ability to merge or split themselves up into smaller entities.The planets or areas of local density,if we can call them that,have no more density than a cloud in my planet's atmosphere.The entities evolve by being creative in their own right. SE3:That would be a reasonable summary. 

### Working Together-A Job for Life! 

ME:I can't help feeling that I am missing something though.It's like there is a piece of the jigsaw that is necessary before I can finish with my dialogue with you. SE3:You want to know what my entities do when they are attracted to work within the vicinity of local density you call planets. ME:Right!

SE3:Then I will tell you as I can see that you want to get down to the coal face/nitty-gritty/ basic levels of existence in my universe. ME:Correct. SE3:My entities do not need to have the trappings of life that you have in your universe and,therefore,do not use or create them.In your universe the entities that are incarnate are bound by the need to create objects of technology to help with everyday existence.Good examples are safe areas where you go to regenerate-you call them houses-and various means you use to allow the physical body to travel from one part of the planet or universe to the other.Some of you even have devices that allow inter-dimensional transport.None of these are necessary in my universe. As we have recently discussed and you have expressed eloquently,my entities can merge or separate to evolve in the way they choose.When they work together as a team,they do so as a team of merged entities,a team of separated entities,or a mixture of both.When they are working as a team,they sometimes find it advantageous to work within an environment where they are limited in their connectivity with the rest of the universe.To do this,they align themselves to the area of local density you call a planet.Now I have previously stated that the planets in my universe are not solid in nature;as a result,they do not have what you would call physicality.In fact,they are not part of a solar system or a galaxy which are clusters of areas of local density within your own universe,for they do not exist. ME:So the planets are singular and not part of a cluster in any way,shape,or form?

SE3:No,but they are spread out fairly equally around my universe.Yes,I see that you have picked up an image of what I am describing.Think of a matrix in what you might call 3D.Then consider my universe as spherical that is filled with this matrix of areas of local density.You will then have a very crude illustration of how my universe is populated with planets.

![图3](img/s6-027.png)

ME:So how large are they? SE3:Some of them are as big as one of your galaxies whereas others are no bigger than your moon.They are all there for the use of my entities in their evolutionary exploits if they so wish to use them. ME:This is very interesting-a single universe with no galaxies but full of areas of local density or cloud-like planets with some of them as big as a galaxy in my own universe but,nevertheless, a planet.I can hardly think of the possibilities that present themselves in a planet the size of a galaxy.What do the entities do? SE3:I have explained some of the things they do from a high level already,but I can see that you still want something extra. ME:I do.I would like to understand what life is like being associated with these planets,even if it is a case that they just mess around with energy for hundreds of years. SE3:The planets are not solid,and so the entities that associate themselves with the planet work within them,that is,in the area where the planet exists.The entities work with those that they are merged with or are split up as a group.Whilst operating within the confines of these planets,the entities'general objective is to use the available energy within the volume of the planet to create something of evolutionary benefit both to themselves and to those merged or separated but grouped entities at a later point in existence. ME:So what do they create?Considering that it is just a level of density that is lower than the surrounding universe,I can't imagine much. SE3:If they are to work within the planetary confines,then they are restricted to use only the energies that are available within this area.As previously stated,they create things that are of evolutionary importance.Some of these things may be constructs that,in turn,use the surrounding energies and turn them into something else of use that would not have been naturally available using the raw energies. ME:So you are talking about the creation of a new material by creating an energetic alloy of some sort?

SE3:In short,yes,but these constructs may even create a finer energy set than that available in the universe. ME:Are you suggesting that they can create a better universe than the one where they exist but within the confines of the planet they are working with? SE3:Yes,this is one of the major reasons for my entities being in existence-to see if they can create something that is an improvement on where they exist-that being the universe and not the planetary environment that is the bliss state. ME:Is there not a chance that it would create a hole in your own universe,a hole that is filled with an environment of improved/increased/refined frequency? SE3:Yes,exciting isn't it?You see,what my entities are doing when they create an area of improvement is creating a new but localized universe.Within this universe they can do whatever they want,and they do!I will give you an example of an area of betterment that was created by one group of merged entities. This group created a universe and populated it with entities they created themselves.These were then given the power of creativity themselves and,henceforth,created their own universe and populated it.This created a universe within a universe,which was a part of a planet in the total universe.Each of these universes had a dimension and frequency that was consistent with the total universe whilst being a microcosm of that universe.Within the first level of universe,the creating entities also created entities that were not given the power of creativity but were given purpose-that purpose being an automatic response to the needs of the creating entities.

ME:What was that purpose?Was it similar to the roles that the nature spirits have in my universe,or was it something else? SE3:If you are alluding to the need for your nature spirits to maintain the integrity of your earth and its surrounding area,then the answer is yes.The whole point of them being created was to help with the continued existence of the created universe and its contents. These universes or created constructs have a limited period of existence or usefulness if left unattended.As a result,those entities that are created for automatic purposes have but one role:to ensure that the creative intention is maintained. 

### Creative Intention 

ME:You've lost me.What do you mean by "creative intention"? SE3:You have this is your own universe;thought is part of your creative intention.The only difference is that when you use your creative intention and create something-whether an object or a situation-that which you have created remains in existence,unless of course it is transposed into another energy for some other reason.Within the universe that my entities have created,they need to create entities that maintain the intention that created the universe where they have been created to exist.In other words,they are the choir that continue the song that is started by the choir leader/s.Their sole purpose is to maintain the field of energy that keeps the universe inflated and maintains all that was created to exist within the universe,including themselves. ME:That must be quite ajob,knowing that if you lose concentration and any part of the creative intention,you might wink out of existence.

SE3:These entities do not know of that possibility,for they are not sentient.Their existence is infinite or until the creating entities decide to deconstruct the universe they have created, if in fact they do decide to deconstruct it at all. ME:So if these entities need to create entities to perpetuate their creative intention,what are they doing that means they can't maintain their own intent? SE3:They are creating elsewhere within the planet where they have aligned themselves. Therefore,they need to divorce themselves from the creative intention surrounding their creation of their universe before they can continue to create anew. ME:So these entities are the equivalent of pit props? SE3:In a word,yes. ME:Are there any other entities created for the maintenance of the "universe within a planet' creations? SE3:I can see that you are thinking of the equivalent of animals in your own universe. ME:Well,I was thinking of both physical and energetic,not just physical. SE3:Animals have a role to play in your own physicality,for they exist in order to maintain the ecosphere.The answer is no.The other entities created to help maintain other areas of creative thought are and cannot be considered as animals,for they are created purely for the use that they were created for.Your animals have another important role to play;they are your companions in the depths of low frequency physicality. ME:So in that case would you call them energetic machines because they seem to be doing the job of a machine? SE3:No,they are more than that as well.They are cognizant of the needs of the energies that they work with to maintain the intention that creates the universe they are working with, for intention is energy as well.There has to be a certain level of autonomy in their existence to allow them to work with the ebb and flow of intention energy. ME:What do you mean by ebb and flow?Does this energy increase and decrease? SE3:Of course.The energy of intention is made available by the creating entity each time the creating entity creates the intention to create something,no matter how small it is.Once the creating entity has delivered its intention for the universe it is working with/within,that energy has to be continued,especially if the intention is to create a permanent creation.This is what these entities are for-to continue the intention energy that is required to continue the creation.Now let's get back to the ebb and flow.The intention energy is only required whilst that creation is required to be present.When a creation is no longer required,the intention energy that created it is returned to the creating entity;therefore,the energy of the maintaining entity is reduced as is the workload for continuing the existence of that creation. ME:Hold on here.Are you suggesting that the maintaining entity has to sustain,hold in the present,the thought supporting the intention? SE3:Yes,that is its workload.On top of that,one of the main pieces of work it has to do is to maintain the thought that created the intention energy that created itself.It,therefore,has incentive to continue its work.

ME:But at some time the creating entity will need to remove the intention energy that is maintaining its own existence. SE3:Yes,but that only happens when the group of entities that have created the universe decide to close it down and when all the evolutionary opportunities apportioned to that universe have been experienced by those entities destined to experience them.In this instance,the creating entities assume control of their own intentions and remove them from the wider universal matrix--thus,removing the universe.Suffice to say,a decent size universe has a long time before it reaches this point in its existence.Sometimes new entities who were not on the original list may request the opportunity to experience that environment,thereby extending its existence beyond that planned. ME:What would one of these intention energy maintenance entities look like? SE3:You are typically human and need to see everything. ME:Yes,I do. SE3:I was advised of this by your Source Entity. ME:I am sorry,but it helps with my understanding and allows me to explain to others who want to understand in a way that they will comprehend. SE3:I will describe one of them for you then.If you were to see them with your energetic eyes and then overlay that image onto your cerebral cortex,they would appear as a ball that is full of stars of differing colors.Each of the stars represents a level of energy that is related to a particular intention.The color of the star represents the level of attention and intention the maintaining entity needs to sustain to keep it manifest.

ME:I can just see an image in my mind's eye.The image I see is a ball full of stars,but the entity has only white stars with a couple that are blue.

![图4](img/s6-028.png)

SE3:Yes,good.That is an example of an entity that has an even level of attention required but with two intentions that are not so important. ME:Why would an intention be of lesser importance? SE3:Because the opportunities it offers have all been used up;therefore,the intention is close to being returned to the creating entity.The color is representative of the number of entities taking advantage of the intention for evolutionary purposes.The blue color, therefore,indicates that only a few entities are using the creation created by this intention. ME:O.K.,I would like to give the readers an idea of what the universal environment would look like if it were to be seen with physical eyes. SE3:You would need to use the process that I described above because you would not be able to perceive it otherwise.Consider that you are in the center of what you call the northern lights,the aurora borealis.The magnetic properties of the planet where you exist manipulates the universal(cosmic)energy in a way that provides a reasonable example of what it may look like on one of its levels. ME:It's full of different colors. SE3:Yes,but that's not what I am looking to describe.It's the energies and how they are being manipulated by the magnetic flux is what I am referring to.In this instance,the magnetic flux can be used to describe an entity,and the colors in the atmosphere represent how that energy is responding to the manipulation.Of course,the colors are just one manifestation of what is happening to the energies under the influence of the magnetosphere,one that you can perceive,but it gives you an idea as there are many levels of magnetic flux in the magnetosphere.The effect it has on the universal energies is not within your range of perception.Suffice to say the universal environment that my entities manipulate reacts in a way that can be described in this method.The planetary environments would,therefore, be a subset of energies that are held in place by a single energy.This allows my entities the opportunity to use other energies,together with their intention,to manipulate them at will and thus create their own universes and entities. As I have stated before,physicality is not available in my environment.Entities exist in the higher level of frequencies that are associated with bliss,so there is no datum within you that I can use to allow a more in-depth description of me and my creations. I will leave you now so that you can contemplate thatthat you have been given. 

### In Closing:A Word from the Origin

And with that Source Entity Three was gone.There was no more contact.I tried to raise my energies and awareness to encompass my higher aspect,going well beyond the levels where I initially made contact with our own Source Entity and up at the periphery of energy that I knew was the Origin.This was a place that I expected to be able to log back into the entity that I was just in communication with,but all I got was the image of all the Source Entities, all bunched up together forming that part of the Origin that it had dedicated to being separate but within itself to assist in its quest for further self-awareness,understanding, and evolution. The Source Entities below me appeared as a group of dark colored opaque balls.Each ball houses the intelligence that is a Source Entity and its creations,universal and multiversal environments together with the entities that occupy them.I experienced a sense of awe that I was once more in this area of the Origin,outside the boundaries of my Source Entity and in the in-between area-that area that is beyond the Source Entities and before the outer layers of the Origin,that area that is and can only be the Origin itself.I sought contact with the Origin with a view to gaining further insight. ME:It has been some time since we spoke,for I have been concentrating on communicating with my own Source Entity and Source Entities Two and Three O:Yes,and you still have the others to communicate with as well.This is not an easy job you have chosen here because your frequency is in variance to all but your own Source Entity and,of course,Me. ME:I feel that once I have established a link with the Source Entity I am communicating with,I can communicate with it.I do have to say that I end up being far more fatigued communicating with the other Source Entities than I do when I communicate with my own creator.I also feel that, so far,the depth of information that I am receiving is not what I expected. O:You expected more detail? ME:In a word,yes. O:If you would check with the level of detail you have gained from your own Source Entity and compare it with what you have gained from your communication with the other two Source Entities,you would notice that it is of a similar depth.The only difference is that in the first book you have delved a little deeper into the human aspect of Source Entity One's environment. I took the time to examine mentally the information about the first book that was in my mind and found that the Origin was correct.The detail and depth were similar.There was still something missing though.The Origin responded to me before I had the chance to ask the question. O:Remember,it would be an impossible task in your current form to assimilate all the information that is in just one universe that your Source Entity created,let alone what is in any of the other universes,dimensions,and frequencies.The information that you have been given is a microcosm of the greater reality-not that it is unimportant.Any level of information that brings the truth to the lower frequencies is important,and each of the entities that have taken on this noble work is only capable of glimpsing and taking on-board a small part of the picture,a single piece in an extremely large jigsaw puzzle. Something else to consider is that you are not alone in this work,for many have chosen to take on an aspect of the delivery of the truth to mankind.No one of you could do it on your own,nor would it be desirable for you to do it on your own because humankind is not able to assimilate such knowledge in the volumes that would be necessary to support such information.It has to be and is being done at the speed and volume that is optimal for the absorption of such knowledge in the projected consciousness of those who are interested, becoming aware,and exposed to those who are interested and becoming aware. Therefore,the work you are doing is both at the correct level,to plan,and in the correct event period.The only other advice I would give you is to not get despondent when you feel communication is both difficult and slow when communicating with the other Source Entities because you are working with energies that are not normally experienced by entities in Source Entity One's environment.I would also ask you to enter your higher aspect more,for that will allow your energies to become more aligned with my energies than they are now.This will help in making your communication with the remaining Source Entities less tiring because you will be using a more universal energy medium than the one that is specific to the Source Entity that created you.Thus,you will not need to rely as much on the hidden translatory function that your Source Entity is providing. ME:Thank you.I will endeavour to do my best in this instance. O:Just one more word of advice about when you reach the level of your higher aspect.As you work with this level of your "self"more and more,you will feel disassociated with the physical plane of your existence.You must be careful of this as it will affect your physical judgement and ability to discriminate correctly when interacting with those of the physical plane who work around and with you.

Go now and work with this information and commence communication with Source Entity Four.

## Chapter 4 - Source Entity Four 

Source Entities One,Two and Three had proven to be an ice-breaker for me as I was a little bit concerned that I would not be able to hold the energy long enough to be able to communicate for any length of time.That is not to say that I found the communication with Source Entity Three easy.Some of the time I felt very fatigued,especially when I was in a position of receiving information that I clearly understood from a perceptual basis but simply did not have the language to describe it,such as the difference in the environments that I have been exposed to.I was thinking about this and what wonders Source Entity Four(SE4)would expose me to when Source Entity One,the entity responsible for creating everything I/we know,decided that it was time that I got off the proverbial fence and started to learn the communication process that would result in my ability to link directly with Source Entity Four. SE:It is time to be elevated to the next level of communication.The Origin has advised me that you must start immediately since the energies that surround you and those you have been exposed to whilst communicating with Source Entity Three will provide a useful springboard for your alignment to the energies that are fundamental to the communication with the fourth Source Entity. ME:What do you mean?The environments of Source Entities Three and Four are of similar frequency?

SE:No,the frequencies used in the creation of the environments associated with Source Entity Four are even higher than that of Source Entity Three.The problem here is that the gap in the frequencies from those that you are used to and aligned to in my multiverse is too big to make the communication possible without first being elevated for a period of time. In essence,you need to be normalized.The process of normalization would normally take a few weeks to achieve if we were starting from scratch,but as you already have a residual level of higher and differing frequency,we can make the jump to the level and type of frequency required in one go.This is something that will be commonplace with you as you start to work with the other Source Entities,for the more you are in contact with them,the easier you will find the communication.Indeed,the adaptation to such frequencies will also enable you to understand what you are experiencing better and give you the language to use in its description for your texts. ME:From my perspective it would seem that the frequencies in your multiverse are lower than the other Source Entities. SE:That is not the case;it is just that they are different.There is one point to note though- only a few of us have decided to create environments that go down to the lower frequencies and dimensions of the Origin.As a result,you will not experience many things that you would consider to be similar to your own current condition,for your current condition is in the lowest of the physical frequencies. Let us delay no longer,for during this short conversation I have been elevating and modifying the characteristics of your higher frequency physicality so that you can make contact with Source Entity Four.You may start whenever you are ready.

The dialogue with my own Source Entity stopped,and I was on my own again.The dialogues with my own Source Entity were now so common it was like talking to a friend sitting next to me;as a result,the room then felt empty.I concentrated on the task at hand-connecting with the energies that would link me to the entity that I would spend the next three months communicating with.I had no idea what the energies would feel like,just that I had been aligned to them in some way by my own Source Entity.Just as I finished typing the last sentence,I felt my body start to tingle and a great weight suddenly came into my head. 

### Initial Contact 

ME:Is that Source Entity Four contacting me? SE4:It is,I have been waiting for you and you appear to be stalling!So I decided to initiate the contact myself rather than wait for you. ME:This I didn't expect,a Source Entity contacting me.It was usually the other way round. SE4:We have many things to discuss and not much time to do it in.What do you want to discuss first? ME:I have a loose format(I was starting to realize that the rigidity of my initial format stemmed the flow of information).I would like to understand how and when you became conscious,what made you decide on the type of environment you created,and what entities you created to populate that space.Also,I would also like you to describe both the environment and the entities. SE4:You do not want much;let me see how I can help without making it too difficult for you. I will start with the wakening,for your own Source Entity has advised me of your format, what you like to discuss,and in what order.But know this,I will diversify when I feel that the information I am giving you is too similar to that given to you by the other Source Entities for there is a certain level of crossover resulting from the very nature of what we are,facets of the Origin. ME:O.K.,I get it.There are similarities between the environments created by the other Source Entities-similarities that,if included in my texts too often would detract from the message I am trying to bring to the public of Earth. SE4:Correct.I will begin.I was one of the first to become aware of who and what I was.That is not to say thatthat makes me any better than the others.It is just that I had a spontaneous understanding and not a gradual awakening.It was like you being asleep one moment and then awake the next.Although I did not have a full set of memories of my existence like you do about your current existence,I was in the knowledge of the fact that I was created by the Origin and had a job to do.That job,I also knew,was the same as the others that I found around me. ME:What did the others look like from your perspective? SE4:They were just as you see them when you position your perception and intelligence outside of your Source Entity;we were like a bunch of black shiny balls all bunched up together.One or two of them would periodically move out of the bunch and change their shape and form or even create things in front or around them. ME:Ijust received an image of one of the Source Entities creating a pinky purple cloud in front of them.

SE4:Yes,that was the Source Entity you will refer to as Source Entity Six(SE6).It is quite a character and is always up to what you might call "mischief." ME:Mischief?How can a Source Entity be up to mischief?I thought you were all very responsible beings. SE4:Of course,we are,but we do have personality as well.You have experienced this in some ways already.It's just that you have ignored it.As I started to describe my awakening,I will continue in this vein. It took me a bit of time (I use this phrase for your help not mine,by the way)to recognize that I had,in fact,just jumped into existence fully aware.My memory of events started from a single point that was not too far away from my realization of lack of long term memory.I shelved that thought for a number of times as I was becoming more interested in what was going on around me as the other Source Entities were becoming aware and were experimenting with energy and form.Their experimentation was a distraction to me in my self-analysis;as a result,I forgot about my questioning of self.I had started to do what they were doing as it seemed the right thing to do at that time. ME:So what did you do?I have already received some information of what you all did in the first millennia of your existence,but I like to know what each individual Source Entity did directly from itself. SE4:As I said,at first I was questioning my "self,"but my attention was drawn to what the other Source Entities were doing.They were just experiencing themselves in every way possible-from creating what you would call "shapes"out of their energy and external form to creating duplicates of themselves on every possible dimensional and frequential level.I copied them for a while-repeating everything that each of them did to and with themselves.This did not last long though as I was more interested in looking into what I wasn't and exploring that. ME:What do you mean-what you weren't? SE4:Each of us has areas that are not part of us.They are what you would call "voids."I found the fact that there were voids in me most interesting. ME:How can you have voids?Does my Source Entity have voids? This was a bit bizarre to me and is not something that I had come across in any of my previous communications with the Source Entities I had been in contact with or the Origin. SE4:All Source Entities have voids.One of the things I was,therefore,very interested in was the reason why we have these voids.This was my major distraction before I returned to the question of "self"although you could argue that they are both part of the same thing. ME:So where were these voids?I can imagine that they would be areas where you have a local lack of density,energetically speaking. SE4:This is not the case.The location of a void could be directly central to an area of what you might call dense energy;it can also be located within an area of sparsely populated energy as well as on the interface of dense and fine energy.I found out that this is a function of us. ME:Please explain what you mean by "function of us."How can the population of energy be a function of you?

SE4:I will give you the example of function and form. As an entity projected into an extremely densely populated area energetically,you should be aware of the fact that some parts of you are denser than others and all these parts have a function.For example,your liver has the function to help clean the blood in the physical and to regulate the flow of energy in the energetic.The blood itself is not so dense and is, therefore,a fluid,with the job to carry oxygen and nutrients to the rest of the body and the larger organs.Its job energetically is to create a framework of the universal energies that are used in your energetic bodies that your healers call astral levels 5,6 &7,which act as an energy cage keeping the correct energies in and around the body and repelling those that are not necessary to the continued function of the physical vehicle.Within your physical body you have voids,areas in-between organs,bone,muscle,and veins (arteries).These voids allow for the expansion and contraction of these organs during various stages of function. Voids are also present as a result of the "incompatibility in form"factor of the organs,bone, etc.-the form factor being correct for the function they have but not for their efficient fitting together in the jigsaw puzzle that is the physical human body.This is the same for us. ME:Wait a minute.Are you insinuating that Source Entities have organs,areas of energy that have specializations,jobs to do?I thought that you were purely energetic. SE4:We are purely energetic,but we do have areas of energy that have specific jobs to do. This is what I found out when I was making my investigations into self.One thing that you need to understand though is that these specialized areas of energy-and they are all over us -are part of our function that enables us to be who we are,separate whilst still being part of the Origin.The voids are just areas where there is no need for function and,therefore, no need for energy-that is,energy of any sort.The voids are an interesting factor though.I am finding out that some of the entities I created use them to traverse from one part of me to another.With there being no energy,there is,therefore,no resistance to movement.We can talk about this in greater detail later because I want to give you more detail on how my colleagues and I are made up. ME:O.K.,carry on.I find this a most interesting development. SE4:As I said before,each of us has areas that have energies that have function.These functions are for the use and the maintenance of"self"with a view toward perpetuation.It would be best if I list these functions first and then explain their jobs in a little more detail later.They are as follows: .Structure .Form .Volume .Detail .Compartmentalization .Singularity -Diversification Multiplicity .Self .Remembrance .Being Structure is the first function of a Source Entity.It is independent and interconnected with form and volume,irrespective of energy or its type.It is what we are,and it maintains our level of inflation,so to speak.Every entity has structure of some sort,no matter how diverse it is. Form is what we choose to be to maximize the number of environments we create.It is interconnected with structure and volume.Form does not necessarily relate to shape since it is a function of division and the energies required to maintain that division.It can also be connected with compartmentalization when creating independent unconnected environments. Volume is how we choose to inflate ourselves in order to accommodate the environments and the entities we create.It is interconnected with structure and form.As with form, volume also has a link with compartmentalization as I can change my volume in certain areas of myself to allow the creation of an environment to take account of all energy of a specific type if I so wish.This is specifically useful if I want to have an experiment with an environment that is filled with a single energy type.Depending upon what maintenance function is being performed,volume also increases or decreases. Detail is what is being investigated by every one of us,including the Origin.It is the detail of "self"that gives us our individuality,our being,our personality if you like.Although every one of us has been created in equality,it is the detail that tells us apart. Compartmentalization is what we do when we create an environment.It is a function that allows our normal functionality to operate without the need to maintain that environment that has been compartmentalized.We can place the environment on automatic,so to speak, or entrust the environment's maintenance to a group of entities created for such a function. Your own Source Entity has done this for your environment.From a creativity point of view, it is a particularly useful function as it means that neither the environment created nor I contaminate each other. Singularity is a function of being and detail.It is what keeps us autonomous from the Origin. Being a singularity means that we are responsible for ourselves and the maintenance of our creations.We are given singularity by the Origin.It is a most special gift. Diversification is a function of our ability to experiment with the different ways of evolving. When new ways are discovered,it is using these ways in parallel to accelerate our total evolution and ability to give such data to the Origin. Multiplicity is a higher function of singularity and diversification.It is the ability to perform many,many things all at the same time.In your language it is my ability to be in contact with all of my self,my creations,and my environments simultaneously without loss of concentration.This is the omnipresence that your priests talk about.I do this because all my energies and creations are connected. Self is that function of me that "is.It is a result of the correct and harmonious operation of detail and being.Self is what we all investigate at the start of our existence.

Remembrance is energy with a most important function.It is the way we continue to know who and what we are and what we have achieved.It is fundamental to the continued efficiency of the diversification function. Being is a result of the combined functions of detail,self,and singularity.It is a higher function of self whilst being separate and independent whilst also being interdependent.It is what makes us Gods in the shadow of a greater God,the Origin. ME:These don't describe energies;they are all functions.In fact,thinking about it,they describe "conditions." SE4:All functions need energy to perform their tasks,so the basic component of any function is the energy that surrounds it.It's what makes it happen.Moreover,a function "is" a condition.In the examples I have just given you,I have very briefly described functions or conditions of my/our existence.You must take into account the fact that energy is the basis for everything that is in existence,from the smallest inert object to the largest entity,such as the Origin.Without it,there is nothing.That is,"no thing"that can be in existence,for there would only be void.A void does not contain energy;humanity does not understand this concept yet. ME:They seem to rely on each other for their own existence though. SE4:Of course,they do.This is the beauty of existence.It is dependent upon the harmonization of many factors or functions working together to create the whole-the whole entity that is me in this case.You have the same thing if you consider again your own physical/energetic body as an example.All of the components that make up the human physical and energetic bodies have a"collective"of organs that have specific functions to perform;each of them has interdependency with the other even if you don't recognize it yet. Some of them have a level of redundancy,and some can even be removed without too many detrimental effects on the whole.You can survive living with one lung,one kidney,one eye, or no appendix,for instance.You can even lose a chakra or two,provided you are not exposed to the conditions where you need ALL of your organs,physical and energetic.You can still exist,albeit in a state of reduced performance.The problem you have with this reduced state of performance is that you do not know what functions are missing that result in the reduced state of performance because you have not used them for such a long time.Your physical organs,therefore,have a set of higher functions that,in some instances,requires what you classify as redundancy or duplication.For example,did you know that your appendix has a higher function that is associated with the accumulation and distribution of what your spiritual healers have been calling "core star"energy? ME:No,I had no idea. SE4:Well it does,and its dysfunction is due to consumption of the wrong food ME:How do you know this level of detail about the human body? SE4:All Source Entities share the knowledge they gain with the Origin and because we are the first creations of the Origin,we gain that which is given to the Origin from our counterparts. ME:So what one learns,you all learn.

SE4:Yes,this is part of the requirement for existence at my level although to a lesser extent, all entities have the ability to learn from the experiences of other entities.The human part of the multiversal records in your own environment,the Akashic records,are an example of this,but it is more of a manual approach whereas mine is automatic. ME:Thank you.So let's return to functions and structure.The names you have used are not what I would use to describe the functions of the energies that keep you in existence as a Source Entity. I find it difficult to relate to the nomenclature versus the functions. SE4:The words I use are what are available in your vocabulary.In a lot of cases this is woefully inadequate.Hence,the words that I have used to describe my functional energies may not be optimal.Nevertheless,they will suffice. ME:So the voids in the energies,would they also have a function even though they are "void"of any energy? SE4:Their position is useful.The energy has to flow around such voids,and flow creates function.As I have stated before in one of my previous descriptions,the voids allow for the expansion and contraction of those parts of me that have work to do in the evolutionary sense.By this I mean that the environments that I create sometimes need to be bigger or smaller,depending on the number of entities working in them or the type of work they are doing. ME:Tell me more about the flow of energy and its importance in function. SE4:Those parts of me that provide my structure need to have energy flow to allow the function to operate.You see,energy is not and cannot be inert,static,or stationary.It needs purpose.Flow is,therefore,a product of purpose in energy.But let me tell you this:flow is not what you think it is.You think of flow as that which water does when it is moving in a certain direction or around an obstacle.Indeed,flow is and can be described as direction,but in this instance direction is best described as purpose. ME:So when you said that the energy has to flow around the voids in your structure,you meant that it has purpose.So what would that purpose be? 

SE4:Where energy has flow around the voids,its purpose is to maintain the boundaries between the void and the environment.Flow is also used to create a framework for an environmental construct and its habitation.It can be the barriers between environments, and it can allow travel between environments should you wish to do so. 

### Environments 

ME:I would like to move on to the construction and inhabitants of your creations if I may. SE4:Please do so. ME:How is your multiverse/universe constructed?In my dialogues with the other Source Entities, I have been advised on the level of dimensions and frequencies,and I learned that they are based on the number twelve,my own Source Entity having 12x12x12x3 dimensions. 

### 24 Dimensions and 2,322 Frequencies 

SE4:I have a slightly simpler philosophy when it comes to such things,for I believe that too much complexity is detrimental to the task of evolution.In my instance,I have 24 dimensions and frequencies.That is 12x2x0x3 in your language.

ME:Now you have confused me.I would have thought that the method used to describe 24 dimensions would have been simply 12x2 not 12x2x0x3. SE4:There is a universal constant that it is necessary to use in the construction of a dimension,and this is based upon the way that the Origin is formed.That means there needs to be a basis for the first true dimensional platform,which,in this instance,is three.It is also based upon the lowest dimensional condition.It is not frequency-based. This is something that I see you are getting confused with,for you are mixing frequency and dimensional descriptors together in your mind. ME:I thought I had got this straightened out during my dialogues with my own Source Entity. SE4:Clearly not.Your Source Entity has stated that it has 12x12x12x3 dimensions,equating 5,184 dimensional environments,but there are still only 12 dimensions as described to you in your first book.Let me make it a bit easier for you.When you multiply the figures we have just discussed,you end up with a number of separate environments.Each of them has its own frequencies and frequency range.These are dimensional environments,not true dimensions,per se.In one of your previous communications with your Source Entity,you discuss the concept that there are actually ten dimensions-the first three equating to one true dimension with the remaining nine being a dimension in their own right because they all need the first three to be in place first before they can be in existence themselves because the first three are the basis for dimensional existence. ME:So if I use the description given to me during a previous dialogue,you have twelve dimensions within two environments.

SE4:Not quite,for the way that I have constructed the compartmentalization of my environments is not based upon the need for nested or separated areas of existence.For instance,Source Entity Two has four environments with the dimensions divided into these four areas while I have simply used the whole of me to create 24 dimensions.Of course,if you use mathematics to explain the number of dimensions,you would get 72.In actual fact, the last number(three)as we have already discussed is really equal to one. ME:So you have 24 dimensions to play with,so to speak. SE4:Correct.Each of these dimensions is inflated with 2,322 frequency levels. ME:That's a strange number.Why 2,322? SE4:That is the number of frequencies used to create a useable environment without overlap.In your own environment your frequencies have peaks and troughs where it is possible to move into one frequency from another in areas where the peak of one frequency is in direct proximity with the trough of another.This is not possible in my environment since a true and substantial change in frequency by the individual entity is required for translation to occur.This is only possible through a significant change in evolutionary condition. ME:So how many entities have you created to fill these 24 dimensional environments? SE4:Fourteen thousand million,plus or minus a few hundred thousand. ME:I thought that you would be able to pin that down to the last entity.Why the plus or minus? 

### Eternal and Non-eternal Entities

SE4:Whereas you have eternal existence,some of mine do not.This was a result of the creation process that I used.Creativity is not always perfect,a condition that your Source Entity is fully knows.As a result,some of them do not exist long and have to be re-created.In doing so,I create more than I previously created.I do this in order to compensate for those who are imperfect.This circle of creation has not yet been completed;eventually they will all be eternal,but that is a task that will be achieved later in my existence. ME:So you created about fourteen thousand million entities with some of them not being eternal. How do you resurrect those that are not eternal when they expire,or do youjust replace them with another entity? SE4:I don't just replace them for I owe them continued existence due to my creation process,so in this instance,I work on the energies that they are made of and re-create them with the energies they should have.I can see that you are confused by my use of your language,so I will explain again.When I re-create these entities,I copy the essence of what they are both energetically and in experience-that is,those experiences and the resultant evolution content leave an impression on the energy that is the entity.In order for me to resurrect them completely,I need to re-create the energy that resulted in eternal beings and imprint the impression that their older energy had-the evolution content and the energetic personality,if you like,into the new energy that I have created in its entirety.This ensures their continued existence. ME:Do they know that they are substandard compared to the rest? SE4:No.In this instance I have withdrawn the memory of longevity from each of my creations until all of them exist in equality.Once I have finished this work,I will allow the knowledge that they are eternal to permeate into their energy field.Right now they don't recognize or,in fact,understand that they are or are not eternal.They just are,and the work that they are doing is interesting as a result. ME:How can an entity not know that they are not eternal when they clearly are?I am talking about the ones that are actually eternal here. SE4:I am surprised at you,for is not mankind largely unaware of its immortality? ME:You're right.At least currently in the physical we are unaware that we are eternal unaware that the majority of us is energetic and only a small part of us is projected into these low frequencies where we exist in a very solid vehicle,the physical human body,to allow us to experience existence in the material part of this universe.But as both/either bystanders and participants in the death process,we experience the demise of the physical body on a regular basis while remaining totally ignorant of the fact that life in the physical is transitory.Your entities must experience this as well to some extent. SE4:They don't as they do not currently feel the need to experience existence at such low frequencies yet although the do experience physicality. ME:But they must know that they are eternal due to the long time that they have been in existence and the number of memories that they have of their experiences.They must remember these? SE4:As I said before,I remove the memory of longevity from all of my entities so that they do not know that they are eternal.I do this by only allowing them to keep the most recent memories and some other key memories,but I ensure that these key memories have the event location markers removed from them so that the entity cannot place the order or note the event where that knowledge was gained as the result of experience. ME:So where does that knowledge go to if it is removed from them on what I assume is on a regular basis? SE4:I keep it within myself with a view to passing it back to them all when they are all eternal. ME:That's an awful lot if information you must be keeping. SE4:Along with the other Source Entities,I have an area of energy within myself that is just for the retention of experience that is not only my own experiences but all of the experience gained by any of my creations.This is the same energy that passes on experience to the Origin.All I do is provide a level of compartmentalization to occur so that the experiences of each individual entity are assigned to the entity that experienced the experience.It is quite a simple routine and one that is automatically achieved once set-up.You have something similar in your multiversal environment;you call it the Akashic records.The difference between the two records is that in my set of records,the entity will only be able to access them all once I have given all of my entities eternal existence.On top of that,they will only be able to access their own records.They will not be able to access the records of any other entities within any of my environments. ME:I have just seen an image in my mind's eye that suggests that you have compartmentalized your entities into different sections within your twenty four dimensions.Can you explain whatI am seeing here?

SE4:Yes,of course,but I can see that you have an expectation I have separated those entities that are eternal and put them into one environment and those that are not eternal into another. ME:That thought had crossed my mind,but I can see that this is not the case from the way that you are leading this conversation. SE4:You would be right to think in that way.No,I have not separated them in that way and the reason why I haven't is actually quite simple.The reason is that I am gradually changing the energies of those entities that are not eternal to being eternal.If I had them compartmentalized into eternal and non-eternal environments,then I would have to move the entities that I have made eternal from the non-eternal environment into the eternal environment.This would upset the balance of the population of entities within each of my environments,which ultimately would result in the one that was full of non-eternal entities being empty.No,I have not separated them out for this very reason. ME:O.K.,I would like to ask some questions. .What are your environments like? .Do they have physical aspects,such as planets etc. .What are your entities like,how are they made up,and how would they appear to us? .What are your entities doing? .What are your entities creating?Do they need to create to evolve?[SE4:creativity is an essential and universal requirement for evolution]

How are they evolving? .How are they organized/civilized? SE4:You have a lot of questions.It would be best to work on them one by one,as there may be many questions that come out of each.I think you would call them nested questions? ME:I believe that is correct. 

### Constants Involved in Creation 

SE4:One thing you need to note here is that there are a number of constants that are involved in the creation of an environment.These constants are what we are given by the Origin to work with and as a result you may find that some of the descriptions I give you may sound similar to those you have already received. ME:Actually,that is something that I am a bit concerned about.Will the readers of this text not think that this is all made up,that I am using my imagination and that as a result of the magnitude of this task,I am running out of ideas? SE4:They can think what they like.The truth of the matter is that even we have constraints to work within.I will explain further.The energies that we,the Source Entities,work with are essentially energy from the Origin.It IS the Origin's energy,and as such,we all have the same set of energies,the same building blocks,if you like,to work with.As a result,there are bound to be similarities.The similarities are based around the energies we are working with and how we combine them during our creation process.I will give a further example. The similarities that you find in the flora and fauna on your planet are because they are all created by using the same set of building blocks that you call DNA.Using DNA creates a finite set of physical vehicles,some of which are similar,such as humans and apes,rats and mice, all of the fish species,all of the bird species.Commonality is everywhere as a result of the use of the same building blocks.Please note here that I have just been told by your Source Entity that there are many species that you have not catalogued yet,for some of them exist as semi- physical entities,and others have not yet been created as the permutations available are not anywhere near being used up yet.The universe is the limit in this instance.But let's get back to my environments. I have created four main environments or universes,each consisting of the twenty- four dimensions and with 2,322 frequencies.Although Source Entity Two has four environments,this is only a similarity in division.And whereas other Source Entities have allowed all of their entities and their environments to be purely energetic,I have decided that all of my environments have what you would call a physical aspect to their appearance. This means that they have different levels of energetic cohesion,depending upon the dimension and frequency that is being experienced. I see that you are thinking along the lines of your own physicality. ME:I have to admit that I am thinking along the lines that parts of the environment and its entities have a certain level of solidarity that is based upon frequency. 

### Dimensions and Frequency 

SE4:It is a reasonable example,poor but nevertheless useful in description.I will give you the concept in a way that you will be able to understand because there is a difference in how to understand dimension and frequency.

As you rise through the frequencies,you move away from that which you experience at the previous frequency and start to experience that which is present in the new frequency. Using your own frequencies as an example,things like the desk you sit at (of a slightly lower frequency than you and,therefore,solid)will no longer be part of your new frequentic level.However,you will experience other things that are consistent with your experience or expectation of what a solid object,such as your desk is.This is because frequencies overlap to a certain extent,and you are still within a single dimensional continuum.Now if you consider a change from one dimension to another,then you have to consider a bigger picture -that of the dimension and the frequencies.When you move from dimension to another, you also move from one frequency set-one that is aligned with the former dimension- to the frequency set that is aligned to the new dimension.Although the number of these frequencies is the same(2,322),the characteristics can be different since some frequencies can be bigger or broader even when higher in nature. ME:Hold on.I thought that frequency was just that,frequency. SE4:No,frequency has more characteristics than just resonance for it also has the properties you would call magnitude,amplitude,and rotation.Your radio engineers know this and use it to some reasonable effect.Frequency also has the characteristics of spatial position,dimensional position,density,interaction-interconnectivity between different frequencies-and event position--time.All of these can change the modality of the frequencies being experienced and how they operate within a specific dimension.One thing is common though.The relationship between what is supposed to be solid-a solid will not pass through another solid if it is of the same frequency and modality-what is supposed to be non-solid but is in interface with solidity,and the energetic-that which is present in two or more frequencies concurrently.Then add that which is energetic and porous energetically -energies mixing will make a new composite energy if so desired. ME:So what you are saying is that what I am experiencing now in the physical would be duplicated in the next dimension to a certain extent-that extent being consistent with the relationships I have with the objects that surround me and the differences we have in frequency However,this is not the case when I move up and down the frequencies because I will perceive objects of different frequencies going in and out of my perception as I move through these frequencies. SE4:With what you perceive being consistent with the range of the organs or energies being used as the tools for perception/detection;however,if your tools for perception are wide enough in range,you would still perceive objects of your old frequency even though you are in a new frequency.Yes,that is a reasonable summary and one that can be used in most of your dialogues with the Origin's Source Entities when referring to this subject. ME:So your environments have what I would call physical aspect to them? SE4:Yes. ME:Let me get this straight.The environments that you created only allow the entities you created to exist in the physical levels of frequency? SE4:Yes,but don't forget that the physical levels of frequency extend to a level much higher than those that you are currently experiencing.So although there are limitations-physical in nature-imposed on my entities,you in your current physicality would consider them as energy-based beings. ME:O.K.,I think I understand what you mean.Then do they in their higher frequency environment have a universe that includes galaxies and solar systems with stars and planets? SE4:Not as you would recognize them.In your environment and resultant set of frequencies,you have a predominant shape for energy that has purpose,whether it is sentient or not.That shape is the sphere.In my environments the dominant shape for a large collection of energy is more like what you would call a doughnut. 

### The Doughnut Universe 

ME:A doughnut?Now you are playing with me. 

SE4:Not in the slightest.You see,the level of density in my environments dictates whether or not there is a center to the energy that collects to create what you know as planets.You are brainwashed into thinking that a planet needs to be a certain form.In essence,there is no dominant form for a planet-any form will suffice.Please note though that the form of a planet is based upon many factors that are beyond that which exist in the static frequencies. The doughnut form is common in my environments. ME:Do the entities that exist in these environments with doughnut ring planets work on the surface or inside the planet?Does it have a surface to live on or are they gaseous in nature? SE:They can be anywhere within the energy field that is created by the doughnut.That means they can exist on,within,or in the middle of the void centered within the area you may consider to be a solid mass.This center point would be the origin of the radius of the planet.This void is not truly void for it both contains energy and attractivity-what you might call gravity.It is this attractivity that keeps the planets shape the way they are. ME:I have just received an image of a ring magnet with the location and shape of the magnetic field superimposed on it.The field is a series of circles that go around the doughnut whilst also touching in the middle.No,they are interlaced in the middle.This appears to create another field that covers the whole doughnut shape.That can't be right.A magnetic field does not do that,at least not to my knowledge.It appears to be the same as both a ring magnet and a standard solid magnet.

![图5](img/s6-029.png)

SE4:That's because you are not actually seeing a magnetic field in your image.What you have seen are the dominant lines of attractivity that surround and contain the energies that form the shape of the planet at its level of physicality/frequency.

ME:So what entities live in the different areas?By this,I mean inside the solid,on the surface,or in the void? SE4:There is only one sort of entity,and it is able to adapt its form to whatever is best for the part of the planet where they like to exist-either in,on,or by it. ME:You said that they are physical.Are they metamorphs? SE4:As I previously stated,they are physical but not in your level/type/form of density. No,they are not metamorphs as you would describe or has been depicted in your science fiction books and films.They do modify themselves energetically to ensure they function at peak efficiency in the part of the planet they wish to inhabit.By creating their own field of attractivity,they draw those opposing energies that are necessary to allow what you recognize as a tactile response.The field is both personal to the entity and modulated to specifically attract the opposing energies. ME:Can you describe the form or shape of these entities? SE4:They have no specific form that you would recognize as a physical form because they change themselves to suit their local environment.However,if I was to describe the forms they have in a general sense,would that suffice? ME:Yes,of course. SE4:It would be relative to the doughnut-shaped worlds only. ME:That would be fine.

### Three Entities,Three Environments

SE4:The form the entities generally assume when in the central void area of the planet would be like a huge butterfly-type shape with the wings as accumulators of energies that allow their translation from point to point by using the lines of attractivity.They are very high in frequency. The form they generally assume when on the surface of the planet is more like a heavier version of the butterfly form but with the wings deflated to the point of uselessness in a void environment.In this instance,however,the wings attract different energies that ensure that the entity is able to operate in a similar condition to you in a gravitational field.Other appendages also become visible for using energies and areas of physicality that cannot be handled by the deflated wings. The form they generally assume when below the apparent surface of the planet-somewhat similar to the difference in air to water on your earth-is,therefore,a matter of creating a more streamlined form of the butterfly shape that has a repulsive field surrounding it.Its form would be a bit like crossing the surface-based form of the entity with a(Pause).I am thinking of using the word "fish,"but the imagery is wrong.Let me search your memories further.O.K.,I would like to use the word crayfish or crab but with significantly less density. 

Figure 2:The Heavier Version of the Butterfly Form

![图6](img/s6-030.png)

ME:I am not sure I can get my head around this form factor. 

SE4:No,I can see that the description is woefully inadequate in your experience and language,but it will have to do.Suffice to say,the form they adapt is the most effective for existing in the environment inside these planets. 

### The Planets 

ME:Do these planets revolve around a sun? SE4:There is no need to have a local gravitational anomaly to attract and burn energies to create light and heat or all the other energies that are created in the combustion process that is the function of a sun. ME:Why is this? SE:We simply don't have the need for suns in my environments because light and heat is not required to either illuminate the universe or provide fuel or energy for those areas of local density that can be classified as planets.What we do have are areas where some of the planets of similar composition cluster together.You may call these galaxies if you like,but we don't have solar systems.In essence,we simply do not have the low frequency level that results in your sort of universal creativity,such as suns with planets rotating around them with solar systems that cluster together and rotate around themselves or create cloud-like formations.In a universe where heat and light are not required to sustain life,there is no need for a fire to create it. ME:I have just had another image in my mind of the planet you described to me.It appears to be all dark blue in the area of the doughnut that I would call solid.Would this be water? SE4:No,these planets do not have water.Water is a by-product of one of the most common elements you have in your universe,hydrogen.It is not available in my environments because the level of physicality is higher in frequency which negates its existence. Remember that material elements are a result of low frequencies.The fundamental law with frequency(across all Source Entity environments)is that the higher up the frequencies you go,the less material elements exist,and the more energetic elements exist. ME:So what is the blue appearance if it is not water? SE4:It is the visible representation of the major energetic element that makes up the planet. ME:Are you suggesting that these planets are primarily made up of one element? SE4:In general,yes,but the planet in your image also has some other elements.Your own planet is currently very physical in nature.As a result,it is made up of many low frequency elements-more,in fact,than any other planet in your universe.

The blue color is simply an emanation of that major element.It is also a product of the energies'response to being worked with by the entities that exist on and within its energies. ME:So those three entities you described make the planet the color it is. SE4:As I stated before,it is a product of the major element and its reaction to being used by the entities that work with it. ME:Does the color change as a result of the purity of the work the entities do with the planet? SE4:Only in the intensity of the color.You can tell the level of entity and planetary evolution by the intensity of the color of the major element of the planet. ME:I have just seen an image of agroup of planets,all glowing in brilliant colors.It is a beautiful sight. SE4:Yes,it is.That particular cluster of planets all have the same entities working with them in group harmony.They are evolving well,in both a planetary level and a group/individual entity level.I am pleased with them and their efforts. ME:I get the impression then that the planets are not solid in the sense that I know insomuch as the entities do not feel physical resistance when they work below the surface. SE4:No.There is what you call a surface tension that is at the interface between the surface of the planet and the inside part that is contained within the doughnut shape,and this is what some of the entities exist on.This is not to be confused with the crusty surface that your planet has.This is a relatively smooth surface and one that has little opportunity for other entities to exist on,such as trees or bushes.It does have other more mobile entities though,and these are entities created by those that exist in,on,or outside the planet's physicality but still within its energy field. 

### Mobile Entities - Living Cities 

ME:Tell me a bit about the mobile creations that the entities create that use the surface of the planet. SE4:They create areas where they can work together in the manipulation of energies to further create what you might call biological forms.Biological is not the correct term,but the concept is the same.By this I mean that the entities they create are designed to be self- sustaining energetically.To enable them to be self-sustaining,they need to be able to roam the planet's surface,so to speak,seeking areas where the energies they use are at their prime. These entities are singular and collective.The collective ones are usually much larger in size. They are seen as the areas where this planet's entities work within to further interact with the energies of the planet.It is for this reason that they are mobile,for they need to move themselves to the next location that is required energetically to support the work of the higher entities. ME:I have just received an image,and I thank you for all these images.They help a lot in my understanding of whole areas of what I can only describe as buildings,moving together to the next location.Wait a minute.The number of these buildings-they are of all shapes and sizes- is massive.It must be as big as a city in earthly terms. SE4:If you were to draw a comparison,then you would need to say that they are bigger than your biggest city on Earth.That is a true city,not including suburbs.
