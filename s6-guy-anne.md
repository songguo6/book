## Introduction 

This was not a book I expected to write.Indeed,it came as a complete shock to me.I was within a year of finishing The Origin Speaks and was five months into being a widower.We, the UK that is,had been having some great weather for a change and I was making the most of it by taking my laptop outside,setting up a refreshment table and power cable,while wearing my Levi's shorts.I like a relaxed environment when conversing with any of the energetic entities,Source Entities,or The Origin I communicate with,and the more relaxed I am the better the link with them. For some reason my mind wandered away from the dialogue I was having with The Origin and I began thinking of my late wife,Anne.I think about her every day and am fortunate enough to be able to communicate with her using the same methodology as that used in my previous work,so it came as no surprise that I heard her voice in my head,saying hello and letting me "know"that all was well and that I should "keep going."What was a surprise, though,was the intensity of the message she was about to deliver. A:We have to write a book together. And then The Origin added... O:It will be called The Anne Dialogues.

Such was the intensity of the message that I almost fell off my chair.I laughed and cried at that thought and then wondered what the subject matter would be about. A:It will be about the incarnation process. As a result,over the last twelve months,I have been receiving some of the conceptual information that will be presented in this book(to whet my appetite I guess!).It plans to provide a leap forward in our understanding of the incarnation process and what happens behind the energetic scenes,dispelling a few myths and removing a few humanisms in the process.This,I thought,is worth doing as it will change the way we see ourselves,removing the human clothes from the current set of knowledge and deepening our understanding in the way that it should be understood.It would be done without metaphors and the limitations of the use of previous language/vocabulary. In putting this to one side,I recall a very interesting event that took place in June of 2013.I was presenting one of my Traversing the Frequencies workshops at a very nice venue in Oxfordshire,UK.On the first day of the workshop one of my students,an extremely intuitive lady in her own right,said that she had a message from Anne for me,presumably to give me evidential proof of my communication with her from a completely different and independent source. As if I needed proof!

This lady had never met Anne and neither had she communicated by telephone or the Internet.She said that she knew where I was to write a book with Anne,that it was to be on a bench with a green wall behind her and a bird table to her right or on the porch of a "log cabin."Both were places,she said,where Anne used to wait for me to come home from work or from a cycle ride.This was correct and that night I took some images of the area, presenting them to her the next day.She was excited and emphatic that these were the clairvoyant images she saw in her mind's eye.The green wall was a high evergreen hedge and the log cabin was our wooden summerhouse.The paneling looked like logs to the observer if seen from a distance but it was the same scene.Later that day this lady gave me another message from Anne. A:Tell him he is going to Japan. That was it.A flood of joy came over me and I had to hold back the tears.No one,certainly not of this group,knew that I was going to Japan to practice Aikido.I had only purchased the flights a few days before and made the decision to go a week or so before then.Moreover, no discussion was had with Anne about a Japanese trip before she returned to the energetic. Everything told me that this was a job that had to be done as soon as possible,and the previous plans for a book were put to one side in favor of this. I have since been given another title for another book,The Om:Dialogues with the Uncreated, announced in the final pages of The Origin Speaks,making the number of "published/ known"titles to equal seven.I will not bore you with yet another three unknown titles as they will be announced in due course.However,no more than five days ago(from writing this introduction)I was "told"that this "total"of ten books,five completed and five works in progress,is incorrect,and that two more would be necessary,making a total of twelve."Now where have I heard that number before?"I thought with a smile. A:Come on,you need to insert the eulogy you wrote for me before we can start proper.It's a nice summary of our/my life. Some of the concepts,the chapter headings if you like,started to flood into my mind. This was going to be a very interesting and different direction to go in-certainly from my perspective. I was going to enjoy this!

## 1 A Life Remembered 

From the moment I met Anne,during an Aikido course in 1985,I knew we were to be together.Indeed I couldn't take my eyes off her while practicing with the other students!I was also a keen SCUBA diver and six months after asking her to a "Diving Club"BBQ I asked her to marry me.We had hit it off from the start and had in actual fact put a deposit on an engagement ring only two months into our relationship.I presented the ring to her on one knee on a canal bridge in the country near our parental homes.She was so excited,as was I. Anne was to be our home hunter,and one night in 1987,after an Aikido class,I dashed over to the local phone box(no mobile telephones then)and asked her about the cottage she had seen in the paper.She was about to put an offer in.I asked her if she was sure.She said, "I love it,it can't get any cottager."We bought our cottage in August 1987 with a bridging loan and thankfully completed the purchase one day after the loan deadline of affordability. Anne loved it and called it her only home,never wanting to move.I remember having to repair the roof the day after we got the keys.Five slates were needed!The next six years were financially hard with the interest rate in the UK soaring to 15 percent and our combined salaries barely keeping up. We worked on,though,building a front porch and a garage and enough internal decoration to make the cottage livable,with the help of my father and a couple of short-term loans. Later,with a small inheritance from Anne's grandmother,we built an extension upstairs and gained an additional bedroom and a full-sized bathroom.We installed an AGA(cooker) in 1992.The year 1999 saw the last room redecorated and LPG central heating installed, with the final touch,a rear porch,being installed in 2003.In our cottage,Anne was in heaven. Outside of home life Anne had a great affinity for the city of Birmingham,specifically adoring its university and multicultural roots,and very much felt the need to give something back to the city that had,in her mind,given her everything she had.Her desire to pay something back resulted in the creation of the "Friends of Birmingham Society"(FOBS) Helped with three other cofounders,the FOBS held its first multicultural concert in the City of Birmingham Symphony Hall in 2002.Anne raised f38,000 over ten years to support these events,the last one being in 2011.In 2005 the FOBS gained charity status and was awarded the rather rare number of 1110444. Anne's career was in the biological sciences,which resulted in her gaining a PhD in 1991. She was a naturally adept scientist and found herself at the forefront of what was then a new area of research,to investigate the functions of programmed cell death,cell apoptosis. Scientists do not have it easy,though,and funding for grant-based research was starting to get difficult.As a result,in 1996 Anne traveled to Chicago for three months just to "keep working."Indeed,Anne never really gained a full grant from that date,and such was the nature of her resolve and excellent work,that she managed to continue to find work in Birmingham University on the residuals from other grants right up to the date of her (forced)retirement in 2008.Anne authored over thirty papers in her career. Anne loved traveling and we had holidays all over Europe,America,the Far East,China, Japan,and Australia.We enjoyed Aikido,skiing,diving,cycling,and other activity holidays. This didn't include the visits to other cities resulting from university seminars or our city breaks.Anne loved the theater and enjoyed seeing Royal Shakespeare Company plays at Stratford and going to the ballet.She especially loved Christmas,and seeing the Nutcracker ballet with her goddaughter was one of the highlights of the year for her. In the early 1990s we fell into a routine of going to a marina,"The Marina del Este,"in Almunecar,Spain.In this era,from 1991 to 2001,we had many skiing(Sierra Nevada)and diving holidays as a result.Indeed,we wanted to buy a villa in Spain but it was just too expensive.However,on the flight back from a holiday in spring 2001 Anne saw an article stating that old properties in Crete were still affordable,and so she went to Crete to check out a few "plots"in July that same year. In October 2001 we bought a derelict property at the very edge of a traditional Cretian village,and we had it renovated over the next eighteen months.Anne was enchanted by it and the nature around it.She called it her"secret garden."The garden was,in fact,part of the local mountain,and pine martins,owls,bats,praying mantis,and scorpions are to name but a few animals and insects we saw there,not to mention "her"feral cats. Anne shared my appreciation of old British sports cars,specifically MG's,and in 2004 we drove an MG BGT I rebuilt to Crete-it's still there and works perfectly.It was our car in Crete!

Anne practiced Aikido with a passion for thirty-one years,gaining second dan along the way.She loved the community spirit surrounding national and international Aikido,seeing and wanting to take part in the work surrounding our organization.She was a past newsletter editor of the United Kingdom Aikikai newsletter and planned to be the treasurer of a new national governing body,the Joint Aikikai Council.She very much believed that we should all be one,a theme that permeates through our spiritual work. Anne was(and still is!)an integral part of the workshops relating to my books,traveling with me during my attendance at the Ozark Mountain Publishing Transformation Conferences in 2011 and 2012,the US tour and the New Earth Cruise in 2012.She has seen the work go from strength to strength and was both amazed and proud of the interest,while also providing essential support.She graduated as a "Traversing the Frequencies"Level 3 Student in November 2012. Retracing our steps a little to Anne's health,in September 2003,Anne had had a seizure, which was later diagnosed as being the result of a rather rare and diffuse brain tumor.A biopsy in January 2004 proved its morphology as being polyclonal,with one of the cell types being potentially aggressive. January 2007 saw a de-bulking operation,removing a very large area of the tumor.Anne, in typical style,undertook this operation fully conscious,only taking a local anesthetic.The consultant surgeon was amazed at her resolve. Daily life progressed and the tumor was monitored via MRI scan on a regular basis,but unfortunately the tumor was insidious and Anne suffered a major seizure and relapse in May 2009.After two months she was fully recovered but needed regular chemotherapy. The chemotherapy continued for eighteen months and during the Christmas/New Year of 2010/2011,Anne,feeling OK,took a therapy break.This break lasted through 2011 until she suffered another relapse in late December(two and a half years since the 2009 relapse). Recovering again she commenced therapy with a new series of drugs,one of which resulted in a reduction in liver function.This drug was removed from the regime during June 2012. Anne appeared to be OK,though,and a scan in August showed some improvement. However,just before and during the Ozark Mountain Publishing New Earth Cruise,where I was working together with Dolores Cannon,we noticed a few,but increasingly progressive signs that the tumor was having an influence again.The latest scan showed massive infestation of the area where the tumor was.It was a complete and aggressive change to its function and resulted in Anne relapsing on 27 November 2012,spending three weeks in hospital.Although Anne initially responded to treatment,she continued to relapse and on 18 December was admitted into a hospice. Sadly,one-half hour into Christmas Eve 2012,and with me holding her hand,Anne lost the battle and returned to the energetic.

Throughout this illness Anne was full of positive thoughts,actions,and resolve.She was, and is,an inspiration as a result. We were married for almost twenty-five years and shared many wonderful experiences together.None the least,we both shared the recent excitement over the gradual,but accelerating,worldwide interest in my channeled writing,which was"our"work-we were, it seemed,finally "on plan." Anne achieved much more than one can expect in a single lifetime.Indeed,we often conjectured that she was living two to three lives simultaneously.It is perhaps because of this that I feel that she had achieved that which she was destined to do.She had done her job, and now it was time to leave,mission accomplished,the tumor being the way out. I am eternally grateful for her love,help,support,companionship,and advice.I of course miss her physical presence but because I am currently communicating with her, experiencing daily communication and gaining further insights as a result,I know that she has never really left me. My love is with her-always and forever.

## 2 Communications with the Energetic Anne: The Start of a New Relationship 

A:You should have put the poem at the front of the book,not at the back. I felt the joy of hearing her voice in my head simultaneously with the realization that I was being reprimanded.I smiled. ME:It didn't take you long to get stuck in.That being,kicking off our dialogues. A:I have been here for ages waiting for you to finish The Origin Speaks. ME:I thought time would not have been an issue for you now. A:It isn't,matey.But I am doing my best to align myself to you so that it is easier to maintain the harmonic resonance necessary to complete this work in an efficient a way as possible.I had forgotten how low the frequencies are on Earth. Anne called me "Matey"when she meant business.I was called other terms of endearment as well in more intimate circumstances-as you can imagine.I had the feeling that this series of dialogues was going to move in some interesting directions. ME:The Sources and The Origin didn't seem to have this problem. A:Of course not.They are the environment we are working within.Because of what we are, we reintegrate back into the True Energetic Self(TES)at a significantly faster rate than energetic mankind does when newly disincarnate.I have had to maintain myself,as an Aspect of our TES,in a reintegration holding pattern. ME:For how long? This was a new one on me.I was instantly interested and wanted to go down this investigative route straight away. A:At least until I have finished my work here,which includes this book. ME:How long will you be able to work with me?I mean,is it just for this book,or do you have other work to do? A:I have been working with you/us for the last sixteen months,Earth Event Space,almost from the start of my ascension from the physical.I have been putting certain events, people,and actions in place to help with the dissemination of this new order of information you are currently working on.Feeding the flame,so to speak,maintaining the momentum.But in terms of what I will be doing beyond the collaborative work on this book,it is not yet fully decided. ME:What do you mean,not yet fully decided? A:You are aware that we are one and the same,that we are the Aspects of a single TES,one that is beloved of the Om? ME:Yes.The Origin has ensured that I am aware of this information. A:Then you should be aware of the fact that at some point this Aspect will NEED to reintegrate with the TES. ME:Yes,I understand that as well. A:Then understand that the maximum period for which I can stay in this frequential environment is governed by the amount of work I have to do to assist you in your work, your project,the amount of work that I still need to do on behalf of our TES,and the amount of work that you need to do to support that Aspect of work which you have taken on board on behalf of our TES. ME:We have our own work and the work of our TES? A:Yes. ME:How does that work?I thought that we would only be working on that which we have been projected into the physical to perform on behalf of our TES and not anything that is associated with the individualization of the Aspect resulting from being in the incarnate state? A:Normally this is correct because the Aspect of any TES is in fact only a method of the holographic processing of singular or multiple experiences.I use the word "holographic"because it would not have been descriptive enough to use the word“parallel." ME:So what you are saying is that other Aspects,i.e.non-Om,only incarnate to experience that which their TES has decided it wishes to experience and nothing else. A:That's right.You see,although autonomous while incarnate,the Aspect is responsible only for the experience/s that the TES has decided to work on using that specific Aspect.That Aspect is chosen due to the specialized functions it has accrued over the number of incarnations it has experienced,and the genre of those experiences within which it has become specialized in. If,for instance,the Aspect in working on this task decides it is better able to work on the task in a holographic sense in its own right,desiring to create a state of a holographic experience/s within a holographic experience,it can elect to create a number of Shards to help it experience the most important angles of the experience concurrently.But it has to decide on this before entering into the incarnate state itself.This,of course,also includes those fracturalized versions of the Shards and Aspects created by Event Space. ME:As an Aspect of an Om TES then we have the capacity to work on our own projects as well,whereas the normal Aspects don't?

A:That's right.But also note this.We don't really have a TES in the pure sense of the TES ME:Explain. A:We are pure sentience and elect to use a body of energy when it suits us.The entities created by Source Entity One,in general,have a body of energy(TES)assigned to them by their Source,which they can elect to move their sentience out and away from at some future point.Om are pure sentience "per se"and never really had a body of energy originally assigned to them,except in the first instance,but that was for the creation of a Source Entity and not an Om. ME:So it was the sentience that separated itself out from The Source Entities and not the energies? A:Yes,but only in the case of the Pure Om and in some rare cases the non-captive Om. ME:So when you talked about reintegration you were talking about the reintegration of the sentience that is split between the incarnate vehicles that "was"Anne and "is"Guy? A:Yes,except in this instance our sentience,our True Sentient Self (TSS)if you like, commandeered a body of energy (grouped energies together for a common purpose) to allow the incarnate process to take place.That being,we had to integrate with a body of energy to allow us to integrate into a gross physical incarnate vehicle.That body of energy our transient TES created by our TSS is only split between the two of us with a larger percentage of the body of energy remaining in the energetic.So in this case we reintegrate back and become one with the transient TES-later the TSS, with specialized Aspects of experience that create the Anne and the Guy functions of sentience or personalities within the TSS. At this point I received an image in my mind's eye.It was like a banana,no a horseshoe with the two ends of the shoe projected into the gross physical,spirituo-physical,and energetic components of the construct that creates the human incarnate vehicle-most of it being external to the "vehicles"-that which was external being classified as the transient(temporary)TES. I chuckled for a moment as I made a lateral link with the word "transient"and the word that the late Steve Jobs of Apple Computers used when he returned as chief executive officer(CEO)on a transient basis.He used the word "interim"with a lower case "I"calling himself the iCEO.He subsequently went on to use this acronym for the iPod,iphone,and iPad.Would this mean I could use the same for the transient TES,calling it the iTes?I suspect I might get sued! A:By the way,I like what you have done to the garden;you have kept it under control while maintaining its natural state.I approve,the trees approve,and the elementals approve. I changed the focus of my eyes to that of the third eye and saw myself surrounded by elemental entities,The Source's maintenance entities,those who were here to maintain the functionality of the flora and fauna of the Earth in all its minute detail.Empathically I logged into them.If they would have adopted human form they would have appeared like small children lying on their stomachs,heads perched on the cups of their hands looking at me in wonder and admiration.It was an incredible feeling to know that they were also with me and were supporting me.

I had been receiving and typing up this information in the place within my/our garden where I was advised to be while working with the energetic Anne.The bench I was sitting on was not totally comfortable and my spine cracked as I sat up straight.My right leg had gone numb as well!If I had expected a rather cuddly start to this book I was grossly mistaken.We appeared to have jumped into the deep end straight away.And,the use of this bench was designed to keep me aware,awake,and alert,no doubt!

## 3 The Cats of Voulismeni: Anne's Influence with the Local Nature 

As I stated at the end of the last chapter,I very much felt that we hadjumped in to the deep end, and as a result I felt the need to start at the beginning of her transition from the incarnate to the energetic/sentient state that she was currently in.At this point I noted that I was using the feminine "she or her"to describe Anne in the third person,and being acutely aware that gender was not a consideration when energetic,I have decided to refer to Anne as "Anne,"and not "she or her,"using instead only the name,the label,that was given by Anne's birth parents. Before I start on this,though,I have one final interesting story to tell about Anne prior to moving on to the subject of the next chapter title.I feel drawn to this because I don't always work on my books or other work while in the UK.Those who have read The History of God will know that we bought a property,a traditional Cretan cottage on Crete,Greece,during 2001,and will note that I made contact with other incarnate,but higher frequency,entities while meditating on the roof terrace of this property.Right now (April 2014)I am on the roof of this cottage and very much feel their presence.The activity of their coming and going is a wonder and delight to perceive. They acknowledge my presence by surrounding me in their love.Also note that all around me is the energy of nature,of our Source.It is largely pure and unspoilt and I hear the birdsong,hens clucking,and goats chewing the grasses.I also hear the meowing of a mother cat in the distance, calling to her kittens.It is the cats that are the focus of this short story,for the local feral cats were Anne's cats. One of my oldest friends and his partner have lived in Crete for ten years now.They were not able to attend Anne's funeral service due to flight availability and so decided to hold a short service on the roof of our property at the same day and time as the service in the UK.They brought a photograph of Anne and the attendees lit a candle.As they started to assemble on the roof a very strange event was observed.A number of cats appeared from nowhere and walked in a processional line,in single file,making their way to the little wall that surrounded the roof.They then split up with each of them sitting on a corner of the roof,looking out toward the countryside. The cats stayed there until the end of the service and then regrouped,reversing the method that they appeared in as they exited the roof,dispersing once on the ground.The attendees were both amazed and delighted at what they "witnessed,"stating that they all felt Anne's presence.I was not surprised to hear this story but was both delighted and overjoyed that Anne was making sure that we knew the truth of Anne's continued existence.The cats had saluted Anne's physical passing in the only way they could,by just "being there"in a way that would be noticed. The Cretan cottage was and is Anne's Secret Garden;it is now named as such and will be the basis for further enlightenment,Ifeel.It has a role to play in the dissemination of my work. A:I am pleased that "Little Momma"is still alive [Little Momma was one of Anne's favorite cats -GSN].Make sure she has plenty to eat while you are there.

ME:Yes,of course.She has just given birth-again! A:Mmmm,that's nice,but hard work for her.You must "feed her up"as much as you can. ME:I put food and milk out morning and night for them.In fact,I have noticed something interesting as well.I can get VERY close to these cats now. No one could get anywhere near them before. A:That's because I can use them as a vehicle for my sentience.You can only get near them now because I am with them.I can use them to be closer to you in the physical. ME:This is a transient condition,I take it? A:Yes.Their bodies,their incarnate vehicles,are not as easy to work with as the human body. Not that the human body is an easy vehicle to work with anyway,but I can use them to experience transient physicality when I want to.Why do you think that Chiki cat [one of our UK cats-GSN]is more "Lovey Dovey"than she used to be!It's me getting close to you to give you company. ME:I thought it was,and thank you for confirming that to me.This makes me want to ask a question. A:Go ahead. ME:Is it common place for disincarnate entities to experience physicality via the physical vehicles that the energy beings that incarnate as animals use? A:Not from an incarnate perspective,not now.That being,not as much as it was.There was a time when the incarnate vehicle available on Earth was lighter,frequentially higher, and during this time the Aspect that occupied the human vehicle was still able to use certain functions that were associated with the purely energetic levels of existence. One of these functions was the ability to move the Aspect,or a portion of the Aspect, temporarily out of the human vehicle and into another vehicle,human or other,such as the animal.You can call this a type of"Walk-In,"if you like,a temporary Walk-In. ME:From the perspective of the disincarnate energetic being,though,this would be common place? A:It happens,provided of course that there is an agreement between the entity that is occupying the animal vehicle and the entity wishing to "Walk-In"to the vehicle being used. ME:They still need to have permission to "Walk-In"to an animal vehicle? A:Yes,of course,but it is more easily obtainable because the incumbent entity is usually delighted to be of service in this way. ME:Because it is only temporary. A:Because it is only temporary and because the requesting entity is usually of a higher quality and evolutionary level.

ME:I already know the answer to this question but I will ask it anyway.Does energetic mankind incarnate into animal vehicles? A:They can but they don't-primarily because it is generally not to their evolutionary advantage. ME:So what about those religions that state that we regularly reincarnate as animals,plants, or insects,etc.? A:That is based upon residual and now inaccurate racial memory of what energetic mankind used to do on a temporary "Walk-In"basis,and not on a full incarnate basis. ME:Do you ask for permission to use animal bodies as a temporary physical vehicle?

A:Because of what I am,I don't need to.But I do anyway out of respect to the incumbent entity.It's only good manners to ask if you can borrow someone's car,isn't it? ME:Yes,of course it is. A:Right.It is time to move on now.We have to explain my experiences resulting from the demise of my last physical body. I got the feeling that Anne was well and truly in the driving seat here.

## 4 The Demise Process 

4.1 A Shocking Discovery about the Use of Sedatives and Painkillers I have to admit at this point that I appeared to be somewhat divorced from the demise process that Anne went through.It appeared,at least to me,that I needed to be as "normal"as possible when Anne was suffering from the effects of the brain tumor.I felt that Anne had realized that it was time to ascend beyond the physical but still had some resistance(a very human thing).If I was normal and optimistic of another reprieve,then so was Anne.If I was busy with everyday things while being with Anne,then all was well in Anne's mind. In the flesh Anne was a sensitive soul while also being an incarnate master-Anne was and is a saint in every sense of the word.Being Anne's husband was a rare privilege and seeing the demise process,ultimately chosen as the exit route prior to incarnation,was so painful for me that ever since the initial diagnosis almost ten years prior,my emotions had shut down.In the hospital Anne knew very well that the administration of morphine and sedatives was not good news and made it known by quoting those immortal words "I am on my way out"-"I am not going to ascend"(this was on 18 December 2012,ascension was supposed to be 21 December 2012).She went on to further say,"You had better have my rings!"I retorted that of course she was not on her way out,that she would ascend,but not in the way Anne thought,and that I would not take her rings-comforting proof for Anne of my expectations,I thought. In all of this I was being swayed by the human side of me,while my "knowledge"of the greater reality was keeping me on track.During the World Satsanga I held on 22 December 2012 at Anne's bedside at the hospice I conducted a metaconcert,a meditation designed to create a synergetic response based upon a multiple of the number of attendees,to give an energetic boost to help Anne move on ASAP.Anne's response of being uncomfortable told me that even under sedation Anne was able to hear what was being said and could respond in a limited way.Anne,I felt,was not too happy at me wanting the demise process to end.I felt guilty beyond belief.Two days later Anne left her body of almost fifty-six years,and me stunned-feeling very alone. A:Ah,but you did me a favor. ME:Sorry? A:I moved on so quick,it was amazing.One moment I was incarnate,the next I was in the energetic. ME:Please accept my most profound and humble apologies for wanting you to leave your body.Seeing you,my darling,suffer in this most undignified way was too much for me to handle so I shut down my emotions. A:Yes,but you have them back now,in buckets.

Anne was right.I had been experiencing emotions on a level that were well beyond my previous experiences.I know it was something that I had signed up to before this incarnation as well.It was like I had inherited Anne's emotional content and empathy for other entities. ME:You are right there.I have noticed a big change in me.I have even inherited your like of turbulence when flying! A:It's there to help you with your travels and to show a side of you to the public that is in ultimate understanding of what people are experiencing while incarnate.It's designed to make you more accessible. It's time to explain the demise process,the function of separation of the Aspect from the incarnate vehicle. ME:Before we start,can I ask if this is a common process for all incarnate vehicles? A:This is the process for those vehicles that operate in the same frequencies as the human vehicle-that being,the lowest frequencies of the physical universe and ultimately the multiverse created by Source Entity One. ME:So it will be generic. A:Yes and no.An Aspect has many ways to disassociate itself from the incarnate vehicle. My disassociation was both typical,and not typical because of the help you gave me.Because of this,my description will be based upon my own recent experience.I may explain other ways later on in this dialogue as this will provide a better level of understanding for all of those incarnate truth seekers while addressing a few inconsistencies. ME:That's my girl!Removing the veil of mistrust created by different reports of the demise process is what I am ultimately looking for. A:Don't forget that some of these differences are due to the lack of understanding,poor education,and existence in frequencies that are even lower than those currently experienced by incarnates.Incarnate mankind is now ready to experience a more profound level of knowledge.That's what WE are here for. I felt Anne smile the smile of one who has access to ALL knowledge now.Having no inhibitions, no misconceptions,no beliefs-only knowledge based upon ultimate personal experience.It was time to get to the detail,detail of a level that is relative to incarnate mankind's new level ofgroup ascension-its new level of incarnate evolution.We had graduated,I felt,to a level where we can now cleanse the knowledge-based system,moving away from hearsay and conjecture to raw knowledge.The incarnation process,I felt,was to be at the bedrock of this knowledge,for this is the starting point for many newly awakening incarnates and therefore,more than ever,needs to be accurate to give it credibility,and those new truth seekers the confidence to continue their quest for the truth without the need to question its validity. A:Owww!It hurts,it hurts so much,can't you take the pain away?-HELP ME! ME:What?

This is almost too much.I am in tears now.I remembered a rather intense moment when Anne suddenly woke up from sedation,looked at me directly in the eyes,andjust said HELP!I instantly went to the nurse to increase the sedative and morphine pump throughput.By this time Anne had passed out-presumably the result of a protective device within the incarnate vehicle to spare the consciousness from the physical and mental discomfort. A:That's what I was experiencing and thinking in those last few days.Brain tumors are painful things to have when they are in their last stages of development.The headaches are intense beyond belief when your poor brain is being squashed by a cancerous growth.Know this,the brain does have a sense of feeling,irrespective of what the neuroscientists tell you,and my brain was in pain-big time. ME:I didn't expect you to relay what you were feeling pain wise as well. A:It was part of what I was experiencing. ME:OK.I understand.I will let you do the explaining in the way that you want to. A:Good.In those last days I was not really associated with the energetic nor part of my incarnate vehicle.The sedatives put me in a state of limbo.I was not yet disincarnate, but I was also not conscious as an incarnate.I was under a very high level of sedation and so was unable to leave at will,which requires a conscious decision process only available while fully aware when incarnate. ME:Are you suggesting the sedatives held you back?

A:Yes.If I was conscious,irrespective of the pain and the level of pain the morphine was able to remove,I would have been able to leave my body at will. ME:How does that work? A:There is a time during the demise of the incarnate vehicle when the bonds to the Aspect are loosened to the point of ineffectivity,that the Aspect is back in communication with its True Energetic Self(TES)and is aware enough of the greater reality to know how to move out of the incarnate vehicle before its demise.If the incarnate vehicle is sedated,the energetic function of the sedatives places this process in stasis because it relies on the removal of the ego,the transient personality created as a result of the incarnation,to allow the personality of the Aspect,a lower function of the TES,to take over.At the point the personality of the Aspect takes over,the decision to return to the energetic or wait to experience the full demise process is taken and the incarnate vehicle either lingers on(the incarnate Aspect sometimes departing mid-conversation) or demises straight away. ME:So again,you are suggesting that the sedatives given by hospitals and hospices actually stop the Aspect from returning to the TES? A:Yes. ME:And that means that the supposed "help"that hospices give to those terminally ill patients are detrimental to them moving back to their TES and liberation from the diseased human vehicle.

A:Yes,it is. ME:This information isn't going to be good news to many people who have "helped"their loved ones depart by easing their pain;in fact,I can see it causing a lot of confusion and concern. A:Yes,I know.Incarnate mankind is like a child who is in the dark trying to operate the most complicated computer Earth has ever seen without any idea of what does what, let alone see the keyboard or command structure. ME:I didn't know that you could use technology as an example? A:[Smile]I picked it up from you.You did have some good points as my husband,don't you know. ME:Well,thank you for that vote of confidence.[I am also smiling here.]Tell me.It's the energies or frequencies associated with the sedatives that create the stasis effect then? A:Yes,it is.Unlike drugs like LSD,cocaine,or vast amounts of alcohol which crack open the auric layers,ejecting the Aspect from the human vehicle through severe disharmony, sedatives have the opposite effect.They actively reduce the frequencies of the human vehicle's energy field because they are low frequency themselves.They create a condition that makes the human vehicle energy field,the auric layers,act as a very effective barrier. ME:Why is that?

A:Because they are so low in frequency they reduce the frequencies of the energy field,the auric layers,almost to the point of full physicality. ME:But I thought that the Aspect,as an energetic condition,would be able to transcend the physical frequencies. A:Of course it can,and ordinarily this is not a problem,but it's the frequencies of the sedatives themselves that create the barrier and not the frequencies of the gross physical Aspect of the human vehicle. ME:Can you explain in some detail for me? A:Yes.The frequencies of the sedatives blend in with the frequencies of the Aspect,the soul, and actively slow them down almost to the point of inactivity.Think of it like trying to swim in a swimming pool full of treacle. ME:That would be impossible,it would be too sticky! A:And that is what the frequencies of the sedatives do to the frequencies of the Aspect.They make the Aspect too sticky to move away from the frequencies of the gross physical, spirituo-physical,and energetic components of the human vehicle. ME:But that's appalling. A:You had better believe it.I was there! ME:I am horrified that the sedatives would have made that much difference to your/an Aspect's ability to return to the TES.

A:What's more,it's compounded by the use of the morphine,which is a most effective painkiller. ME:Carry on. A:Morphine,on its own,is an effective painkiller,but if used in the correct quantities will cause the human vehicle to become ineffective,to pass out,or even cause its demise. ME:I think this is well-known and recorded knowledge. A:Yes,it is,but what is not known is the synergetic effects created by the use of morphine together with sedatives,especially powerful sedatives. ME:Are you suggesting it creates another type of frequency,a hybrid frequency? A:Not a hybrid frequency,a new frequency.Consider the periodic table and how it identifies how materials can change totally by the addition or subtraction of electrons,neutrons, or protons. ME:OK. A:Then consider how two separate materials added together will create another new material that has the best of the two parent materials. ME:This would be called an alloy. A:Agreed,but think again about the periodic table.It's the addition or subtraction of the electrons,neutrons,and protons that create the stand-alone material.This is at the subatomic level.Alloys are at the atomic level and above.

ME:Carry on. A:Using this as an example we can look at frequency,a dominant frequency,in the same way.If we consider that the dominant frequency is the gross physical material in the example,the atomic and above,and the subfrequencies associated with the dominant frequency are the subatomic components,then the subfrequential Aspect of the dominant frequencies are at the subatomic level and therefore create a new frequency and not a hybrid or an alloy.It is this new frequency that acts as a major blockage to the Aspect and not the energetic or gross physical because it acts like frequential treacle. ME:But we only see the physical Aspect and the subsequent results of the physical's response to physical applications,and... A:..and not the energetic,let alone the frequential response!ME:You took the words right out of my mouth. A:Naturally. ME:Mmmm!This is radical new information.It's going to cause quite a stir.It's going to frighten a few people. A:The truth always hurts,and the truth always comes out. The truth always comes out (the truth always outs)was a classic Anne response and it made me smile.Anne was clearly on form and eager to share every Aspect of her ascension,no matter what paradigms it shook!

ME:So what can we,that is,the rest of incarnate humanity,do in this instance?We can't just place a ban on the use of such drugs,can we?It brings a kind of peace to those who are going through the trauma of seeing their loved ones go through the process of physical demise,demise in some extreme circumstances as well.We believed up until now,and that included me,that you/they are being spared the pain and trauma of the process. A:Well,it's time to wake up and smell the coffee,so to speak. ME:Again,what can we do? A:What you did. ME:Sorry? A:If they must help the physical vehicle and the ego,while it is still in existence,by sedating it using drugs to supposedly assist in the demise process,then they must research the effects that the drugs have at the frequential and subfrequential levels to ensure that they don't create a synergetic effect that arrests the ability of the Aspect to leave the human vehicle. ME:That makes the assumption that medical science or centers of palliative care want to believe this information. A:There will come a time when they will understand and make the right moves to ensure that such drugs both assist in both the pain and anxiety and help to project the Aspect out of the energies associated with the human vehicle.

Alternatively they will recognize that certain individuals are adept energetically and frequentially,and can assist the Aspect's departure from the human vehicle,creating a fast-track route through the inhibiting frequential conditions created as a function of using such drugs individually or together.This is what you did for me.You created a rift in the treacle,so to speak.You tore it wide open while also pushing me up and out, back toward communion with my/our TES. ME:But you aren't in communion with your/our TES right now,are you? A:No,I stopped short of that.[Smile]I put the brakes on so that I could fulfill the rest of the work we agreed to do together,with me working from this side.You gave me quite a shove,you know.I almost couldn't stop the acceleration. ME:Sorry!OK.Do you want to describe the process of your leaving your physical vehicle,the vehicle I knew as Anne in the physical? A:Yes.Let's start right now. 

### 4.2 The Light at the End of the Tunnel 

I knew that this part of my dialogue with Anne was going to be traumatic.I could feel the energy associated with it already taking hold.It was a very emotional energy and one that I knew was absolutely necessary for me to enter into to remove my association with it.I had to feel the emotional energy to continue-not the sort of thing I was used to.In fact,I have no experience of any really deep emotions at all-not even when I first discovered that I had met my "wife to be,"Anne,over twenty-seven years ago.This may seem like a strange position to be in from the perspective of the reader,but from my position it was a necessary hurdle to get over.This was another level of karma,association with the physical universe,that needed to be conquered. I knew that I was not only going to experience the demise process from the position of Anne,and myself as a neutral observer,but that I was going to be catapulted back into those last moments of Anne's physical existence and actually experience "those"emotions that I was not able to experience at that point in time. When they came they hit me like a sledgehammer.Able to traverse the frequencies of Source Entity One's multiverse,to rise to the challenge of moving through the voids-the distances between the twelve Source Entities and area of The Origin's polyomniscient self-awareness-I may be,and with relative ease,but when it comes to feeling emotions...I am a raw beginner. A:Don't let me go!I don't want to go,I want to be with you!!!! I see an image of the scene associated with this plea.I am sitting by her side,holding her hand in the hospice room Anne was assigned to,and I was summoning the energies required to allow Anne a fast,an unnaturally fast,exit from the human form.Ifelt that I was betraying her!I was feeling remorse (of helping Anne go quickly),betrayal(of Anne leaving me),and grief(of missing the only one incarnate on Earth who fully understood me).

A:I was scared for a moment.I had reentered my body to say goodbye in the physical and was feeling anxious,worried,and frightened beyond belief.I was experiencing the end of my physical life and had forgotten the preparation I had gone through over the previous couple of days. ME:You had forgotten the preparation?What preparation? A:How to disassociate myself from the energies of the physical and the "knowing"of what I truly was that came with it.Entering back into my physical form stripped away the knowledge of this functionality.It does that.My cry out,you could not hear it of course, was an automatic response that I was not in control of at that point in time.It surprised me just as much then as it surprised you now when you just heard it in your mind's ear.It was a very human response,one that is borne from the absence of no "real" knowledge. ME:But,but the energies I felt were just immense.I felt horrible,lost,alone,helpless.From a human perspective I was losing the only person that understood me,who gave me incentive,who shared my vision,who was my vision. Hearing you say that you didn't want to go just cut across everything that I/we knew was correct.It caused doubt!!!! A:It would do.Especially when you are in a place of fragility,as we both were.Now we are communicating again,in a way that is most profound.The feeling of loss should diminish soon.

ME:Thank you,it is.So what happened after you made that automatic call for help?Did you go unconscious or were you conscious during the whole process? A:I was conscious and it was wonderful,and it was so fast.Actually though,I bypassed the experience that most incarnates have. ME:Go on. A:Normally a "newly disincarnate"entity experiences a certain level of confusion overlaid with wonder at what they are experiencing.The confusion,really a state of disorientation,makes them observe what is happening as if they are watching a film at the cinema,that they are surrounded by a darkness that is all around them and that there is a light in the distance.Hence,the constant reports from near-death experiences that state that the person feels that they are moving through a tunnel. ME:So they don't move through a tunnel then? A:No.The darkness is a phenomenon that is created as a result of the lack of experiential knowledge of the frequencies that are an essential part of the human form,but that exist above the gross physical.The darkness is a result of the incarnate having no reference during their incarnate existence.Incarnate existence gives an entity a vocabulary,one that is not aligned to language,one that is aligned to their lifetime of experience within their physical form,one that is essentially limited to this existence and only this existence.Because the demise process is usually only experienced at the end of the life of the human vehicle,the ego of the incarnate entity has no prior knowledge of this experience,this process,and therefore has no means of understanding what it is experiencing.It has no reference point to work from.In this instance no images can be used as a form of translation,so a blank screen is returned.This screen is either black or white depending upon the levels of frequency being experienced.Simplistically put,the lower the frequencies,the darker the image returned;the higher the frequencies,the lighter the image returned. ME:So the "tunnel effect"is the imagery received that results from the transition of the Aspect from the low frequencies of the gross physical to the high frequencies of the purely energetic.And,this is simply the result of the transient personality of the incarnate entity,the ego,having no memory of such an experience during its own limited existence. A:Correct.What's more,there does come a time during the demise process when the feeling of being in a tunnel subsides and the feeling of expansion takes over. ME:And the feeling of expansion is the result of the dissolution of the ego and the reintegration of the Aspect with the energies of the True Energetic Self,the TES. A:And ..this is the light at the end of the tunnel,the light at the end of the darkness,the expansion from limitedness to omniscience. ME:The expansion into omniscience provides too much simultaneous information for the ego to assimilate in the short time it has been in existence,and this results in the experience of seeing a blank screen,a light. A:Yes,good,you are catching up-fast.

ME:There is talk of the disassociation from the human form taking three days.Is this how long it takes to get to the end of the tunnel? A:Sort of.Although the individual experiencing it states that it happens very quickly,the actual disassociation of the Aspect from the energies of the human vehicle takes some time,especially when the Aspect is not exposed to the greater reality when incarnate. There is a sliding scale if you like,one that illustrates the speed of disassociation as a function of the level of knowledge of the greater reality while incarnate.It shows that the higher the knowledge,the faster the disassociation from the physical-the lower the knowledge,the slower the disassociation from the physical.The slowest takes three days,the fastest is instantaneous. Most are slow,hence the unwritten rule that a newly demised vehicle should lie in state for at least three days. ME:So,if this is what normally happens,what happened to you? A:Simultaneous integration.This was a result of my own knowledge and your help.That is why I had to put the brakes on,so to speak. Before I elaborate on my ascension process,which was akin to that experienced by adept yogis,I would like to add some more information to the"tunnel effect. ME:Why? A:Because there is another reason for an entity to experience the egress of the Aspect from the physical vehicle in terms of "being in a tunnel,"one that is based upon knowledge of the process which therefore allows the entity to experience the truth and not a blank screen (black or white). ME:Please explain.This may help with our understanding. A:Think of the Aspect (soul)as being compressed into the lower frequencies as it is projected out from the TES.In this compressed state it has to associate itself with the human form,or other,it has decided to use as its vehicle on or off the earth. This can be considered as the Aspect being compressed to a point of focus,that focus being from the energetic to the spirituo-physical via a small energy vortex you call the hara line.The energies of the Aspect are positioned predominantly within the hara line as it descends the frequencies to the point of the highest frequency of the gross physical.At this point it balloons out from the tan tien and establishes energetic control of the incarnate vehicle by the use of the energetic system,which,although it is predominantly supported by the spirituo-physical (frequency levels 4,5,6,and 7), allows control of the gross physical(frequency levels 1,2,and 3)and contact with the TES via the energetic Aspect(frequency levels 8,9,and 10)of the incarnate vehicle. I will call this the point of absolute energetic control.This point of absolute energetic control is via an area popularly called the Core Star and it is positioned very close to the tan tien.Another area close to the heart chakras,sometimes called the Soul Seat,is where the essence of the Aspect resides.It is the personality of what we,as a projected Aspect of our TES,are.

ME:I have just received an image of a balloon being squeezed through a straw and then inflated so that the balloon inflates from the opposite end of the straw that it was inserted into.The balloon then extends out and back on itself,engulfing the very straw it was inserted into and inflated via. A:Good,you received the imagery OK. ME:Yes,it was a very clear image and one that was very informative. A:Thank you.If you consider the hara line as an energetic tube(vortex)then,a tube that assists the Aspect to be projected down into the frequencies of the physical universe, and that the Aspect has to go through it,you then have half of the imagery explained. It then makes sense to build upon this imagery by noting that it must return the same way when the Aspect withdraws back into the energetic and the location of the TES. ME:I have just received the "knowledge"that the hara line acts as a form of protection from the effects of the lower frequencies of the physical universe for the line of energies that attach the Aspect to the TES.It allows rudimentary communications to be maintained. A:Yes,it does.As you are aware,the lower down the frequencies an entity travels,the lower its energetic functionality.This rule affects the line of projection/communication as well as the entity or projected Aspect.The hara line allows the basic communication necessary,via the projected energy within it,to ensure the Aspect stays in unison with the TES. ME:And so as you just stated,it must withdraw via the same way it was projected into the lower frequencies of the physical universe,back through the hara line. A:That's right.When the physical body demises,the energies that were inflated out from the tan tien,settling at the core star,disassociate themselves from the energetic network that is predominantly formed by the spirituo-physical,the chakras,and auric layers. The Aspect then deflates,so to speak,moving back through the hara line,back up the straw in your imagery,to the energies associated with the location of the TES.In your image the balloon would then be withdrawn from the straw,the air being released back into the atmosphere (the atmosphere representing the energies associated with the TES and/or its location). ME:And in the case of the more spiritually aware incarnates,they experience the withdrawal of the Aspect through the hara line as moving through a tunnel,into the light. A:The effect of the Aspect withdrawing would feel like the incarnate was imploding and then compressing to a level equal to its ability to contract back through the hara line. The imagery the incarnate Aspect experiences varies depending upon their spiritual education and level of connectivity with the TES just before the point of the demise of the physical body.Suffice to say,though,it would appear like the Aspect was traveling through a tunnel-that tunnel being the energies associated with the hara line, organized like a small vortex,which is also withdrawing itself from its association with the incarnate vehicle at the same time.The light at the end of the tunnel is when both the Aspect and the hara line are fully disassociated from the incarnate vehicle to a point where the hara line is no longer necessary.In this instance,the hara line dissolves and the Aspect is exposed to the energies associated with the TES and/or its location,which would initially be a bright light and would then be converted to any imagery the newly disincarnate Aspect expects to see.This imagery is a product of expectation based upon earthly education or actual real imagery based upon ultimate knowledge of the greater reality and a full acceptance of what it will be represented by. ME:You just said that the imagery is or could be based upon what the newly disincarnate Aspect expects to see.Are you suggesting that the Aspect creates the imagery within the environment that is of the energies associated with the location of the TES? A:Of course.Once back into the energetic the Aspect has access to all of its functionality, which includes creativity,but not all of its memory,so it creates what it expects to see, or not as the case may be,until it regains its full memory. ME:What do you mean,"or not as the case may be?" A:If a newly disincarnate Aspect expects to see a certain environmental image,an expectation resulting from its earthly education,it creates it.This environmental image is only dissolved once the Aspect recognizes that it is created by itself and is based upon false education while incarnate,i.e.,it regains its memory.The Aspect is allowed to keep this "temporary"environment for as long as it needs it or until it recognizes where it is.This is part of the experiential process of being incarnate. This also includes those who expect nothing and therefore see nothing,or experience a nothingness-a limbo.Those incarnates who work with the higher knowledge will experience what is correct and true and will go straight into the review process. We should talk about the post-demise process in the next chapter because right now I want to explain what happened to me,which is aligned to that experienced by those who work with higher knowledge. 

### 4.3 How Anne Ascended 

ME:So if the process you just described is a general process for separation from the physical form,how different to this was your own separation from your physical body? A:It was a completely different method of separation.It was as if the rules associated with the connectivity of the Aspect with the physical form were not applied to me. ME:Can you explain? A:Of course I can.In the process I just described the Aspect has to be inserted into the physical via the hara line to allow it to integrate with the physical body and animate it via the tan tien and core star.The hara line acts as a level of protection against the loss of functionality resulting from being exposed to the low frequencies associated with the physical universe.During the demise of the physical the process of separation is required to be an exact reversal of the insertion process.That being,the Aspect's energies withdraw from the energetic network associated with the chakras and coalesce within the area assigned as the core star.Once in the core star the energies move back to the point of insertion,the tan tien,and then move back up to the TES via the hara line. With me it was different. Normally the energies gradually withdraw and coalesce at the core star over a number of days.This is the three-day rule.But when an advanced Aspect (soul)is fully aware of the process,this can be accelerated to the point where,when the physical body demises, the Aspect can leave instantaneously.This can only be achieved when the energies associated with the Aspect are withdrawn to the point of ineffectiveness in terms of animating the physical body prior to its demise. ME:Would this be when the person who is dying appears to be asleep for most of time immediately before the demise of the physical body? A:Yes,but not always.You see,in general and during demise based upon disease or plain old age,an Aspect enters into stasis before the actual separation.This means the body appears to be asleep while the Aspect enters the separation process,allowing the Aspect to leave as soon as the physical body ceases to function. ME:Stasis can't be a general thing,though,because many die with knowledge of dying and others are alive one moment and dead the next,such as with heart attacks,strokes,and accidents to name but a few. A:Clearly,some Aspects choose to be in control of the physical body right up until demise, but in these instances they are subject to the three-day rule. Other advanced Aspects can leave the physical body at will,the so-called Maha Samadhi experienced by advanced Hindu yogis.But even in this instance the Aspect will have voluntarily withdrawn most of its energies prior to leaving the body.The Hindus know this and therefore recognize that they can dispose of the physical body before the three- day period is over.But in any event all of these methods require the reversal of the process of Aspect insertion into the physical body.It's just that the timing is different. ME:OK,so how did you separate from your physical body? A:I have already said it-with a whoosh! Me:That's not very descriptive. A:No,it's not.I am having some fun with you.As I stated earlier I needed to prepare,to place my body in a state of stasis,of infectivity but that was thwarted by the drugs.So I was a bit stuck.My body was sedated and so was my Aspect,if you know what I mean.On the night of my physical body's demise I was stuck in a dead body that would not let me go until the drugs became ineffective.That could have taken anything up to six or seven days. ME:Almost doubling the three-day rule. A:Exactly.The positive thing here,though,was that you were holding my hand,and you were willing me to go.A very noble act,I have to say.Because of this I had a physical coupling of energy from you and two powerful intentions for me to leave my body, mine and yours,and so I was catapulted out of the physical,rather than staying with it in a limbo state. ME:What did this "catapulting"feel like? A:It's not what it felt like,it's what it was.Not being able to withdraw my energies back to the core star and tan tien,I was stuck.OK,it was only a temporary paralysis that would extend the three-day rule to six or seven,but it was still paralysis.This meant that the connectivity of the hara line with the physical was starting to become unstable as it expected the gradual migration of"Aspect energy"back into it. Noting that the hara line is a temporary construct only in use to place the Aspect into the energies associated with the spirituo-physical components of the physical body anyway,it ultimately dematerializes once the Aspect is back in the energies associated with location of the TES.It was this instability and the impending dematerialization of the hara that made my Aspect's association with it weak. ME:So what are you suggesting here?That you bypassed the need to faithfully reverse the insertion process in your demise/ascension process? A:Not me-us.Our energies and intentions,when coupled together,were so strong that the hara line was literally blown away and I was projected,"catapulted,"back toward our TES.Like I said before,I quite literally had to put the brakes on,otherwise I would have reintegrated with our TES. ME:There was no "tunnel"effect then?

A:Not in the slightest. ME:And you bypassed the need to return through the hara line? A:Yes.It was a quite amazing experience.All of a sudden I felt acceleration.Not in a speedy sense but in a frequential sense.I was going up the frequencies at an extremely rapid rate,one that gave me almost instantaneous expansion-expansion from every functional direction that is available.All of a sudden I was in an omniscient state of awareness,of memory,of observation,of beingness,of connectivity,and of love.I could go on.The list of what I experienced in an instantaneous moment was only limited by my recent human thought processes.It was like a sensory explosion of universe- creating proportions.Being in the human body is like being squeezed into a matchbox! Everything that I was,I am,I will be,I can be,I could do,came back instantaneously. I knew where every galaxy was positioned in the physical universe,where all of the entities created by Source Entity One had incarnated and what they had done,where their TES's were located in the structure of the multiverse and how long and how much work it had taken them to achieve that position.I even knew what the other Source Entities were doing and how they were doing it.And,if I concentrated,I could "zoom in"to the detail of what their creations were doing and how they were doing it. ME:I would expect that level of ability to be reserved to one of the Om. A:Well,as we are both Aspects of the same Om TES that makes perfect sense. ME:So why can't I access the level of detail you are experiencing now?

A:Simply because you are still incarnate,at a VERY low frequency and your physical vehicle could not possibly cope with the energies associated with such levels of connectivity. Note this,though,what you are achieving while writing these books and teaching your workshops is phenomenal in comparison to what normal incarnates can achieve,so don't get jealous on me. ME:I'm not,well,yes,I am,and that is a purely human and karmic trait.I suppose it's a good job I/we recognized it and nipped it in the bud when I/we did. A:You bet it is. ME:OK,you experienced explosive expansion and rapid ascension upon the demise of the physical. A:Yes,but this was only achieved because we were working together. ME:Yes,but what was it like to see your/our TES? A:It was like nothing you can ever imagine.In fact,I will have difficulty describing it in human terms. ME:I am used to that.Give it a try. A:I talked about being expansive and regaining my memory set all at once.Well,the feeling of connectivity is the most amazing thing you will ever experience.Your ability to connect with any part of The Source,and in our case The Origin,is both instantaneous and multidimensional from a sensory-based perspective,so when you say what is it like to "see"your/our TES it is difficult to explain. ME:Why? A:Because we don't just "see"things,not in the human sense.Everything we experience is on so many different levels of sensory connectivity that the so-called visual Aspect of our senses simply pale into insignificance.However,I will put it in human terms for your readers. When I became expansive I could see,perceive,feel,touch,taste,empathize,love, connect,sentiate,intelliate,and omniciate [see the glossary-GSN].And this list is not exhaustive by the way.The so-called visual appearance of the TES is like a ball of energy with lines of energy extending from it to all the Aspects that are projected from the TES and the Shards from the Aspect.The ball of energy that is the TES is not actually a ball,though;it is more like an amorphous mass that is nominally spherical in shape but that is dimensionally permeable.I would like to say that it has a color but that would not be entirely accurate as the color effect is a result of the energies associated with the TES.The energies (color)swirl around within and without the nominal spherical shape pulsating,rotating,irradiating,and dimensiating.The dimensiate condition is most interesting because you can see all the dimensions that the TES is being projected into.It's like you can see the localized content of all of the frequencies,subdimensional components and full dimensions that the TES is projecting Aspects into or that the Aspects are projecting Shards into.Sometimes it is mirror like.Other times it is,for example,like seeing the surface of Jupiter and the Sun together but in a sort of transparent intermingled condition.I prefer to think of it as being like quicksilver (mercury)or a chunk of sodium that has been dropped into a bowl of water. ME:You can see where the other Aspects of our TES are projected into from a total environment and structural basis then? A:Yes,but as you are the only other Aspect of our TES,it only goes to the first full dimension and the physical universe.If I were to look at other TES's that are projecting Aspects into the multiverse I can see a vast network of intertwining connectivity between the TES's and their Aspects and the Shards of the Aspects working within the multiversal structure they are working on or within.If I then focus on,say,one of them,I can see and experience everything that is being experienced and assimilated by the particular TES I am focusing on.What's more,I can see and experience any or all of the Event Spaces created by them as a result of their decision process/es.I also see where you go to when you are communicating with The Origin and other Source Entities,which of course includes all of the current and potential Event Spaces you create in the process. ME:You can see,or should I say experience,all of this concurrently? A:Yes,of course.You don't realize just how constrained you are when in the human form.It's as close to being nonexistent as an entity can get without actually being nonexistent. ME:Mmmm.Don't you get information overload? A:Not in the slightest.Everything that is presented to me,or that I focus on,is really already part of me anyway.

ME:And I guess that is because you/we are really just individualized units of The Origin anyway. A:Sort of,yes.You see,when I focus on what a particular TES or group of TES's are experiencing,I expand exponentially until I reach a point where I have enough capacity to cope with the information being received.It's a bit like gaining access to more memory and processing power,but only for the duration of time that I need it. ME:I somehow get the feeling that you are linking into The Origin in some way and becoming more like it. A:Not quite.That's a higher function.What is happening is that,because I am still an individualized Aspect,I am using the resources of the TES. ME:OK,but our TES is only so big.It must have an expansive capacity that it can't go beyond. A:I don't see any limitations with our TES so far. ME:Why is that? A:Because two things come into play.The first is that it is Om and it is essentially working outside of the structure of the multiverse and the structural functionality of Source Entity One.The second is that another two things occur.The first is that our TES uses the residual expansive and functional capacity of the TES/TES's being focused upon,expanding into them,being them while remaining independent.The second is that it also uses the localized functional capacity of the structure of The Origin that is specific to the location of the TES.Once linked into the structure of The Origin,our TES becomes more than an Om TES,it becomes The Origin from the perspective of the location of the TES and the required expansion and subsequent functional capacity required to experience all that is being presented to the TES.There is a third thing that can come into play. ME:And what is that? A:That our TES,and any other TES for that matter,commandeers more energy to increase the,shall I say,the operational energetic "Mass"of the TES.From the perspective of an Om this is either the energies within The Source Entity they are working with/within or it's the energies of The Origin. ME:But this is all expansion rather than actual TES capacity. A:Of course.Generally,our TES is more than capable of coping with any level of informational experience,and usually it does not need to use these expansion methods. ME:So our TES,a pure Om TES,is infinitely expansive. A:Yes,as are non-captive Om.Captive Om do have limitations. ME:And they are? A:The point of capture.For example,the expansive capacity of The Source Entity they are captive within.But for all TES that are created by a Source Entity this is mirrored down the hierarchy,so to speak.So what I have described about our TES's functionality and how it interfaces with the functional structure of The Origin in this particular instance is also the functionality of a Source Entity TES,but with the TES connecting or expanding into the functional structure of The Source Entity that created the TES,and not The Origin. ME:I would expect that a Source Entity can use the same methods to expand into The Origin, should they wish to do so? A:Yes,but that is their functionality and not the functionality of their creations or those entities such as the captive Om,the Om that are unable to move unaided,outside the energetic boundary of their Source Entity. ME:And you can see where our TES is now? A:Yes,of course. ME:And where exactly is our TES located frequentially? A:You mention frequency.Frequency is relative to energy.It is not "located"energetically,it is more multilocated sentience. ME:Explain. A:It is both within the structure of Source Entity One and within the structure that exists between The Source Entities-the structure of The Origin that is its area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.There is also residual sentience that is still expressing your/our TES's sentience within the energetic boundaries of the other eleven Source Entities.This,my dear one,is how you move outside of the structure of the multiverse,and that which forms the greater part of Source Entity One,out into the wider structure of The Origin and its creations. ME:And how exactly do I do that? A:The same way as I do,by relocating the focus of your sentience,or should I say,that Aspect of our TES's sentience that has created the smaller individualized version of itself that is now occupying the human vehicle known as Guy Steven Needler. ME:So the fact that our TES is outside the structure of Source Entity One is the main reason I can project my consciousness beyond its energetic boundary.

A:Yes and no.Yes,it helps,but,no,it is not a necessary requirement. ME:Why not? A:Because Pure Om can move anywhere and within and without any entity,whether created by The Origin or one of The Origin's creations. ME:The Om appear to be Om-niscient,please excuse the pun here! A:Good to see you are getting your sense of humor back.Yes,they are,especially when energetic or should I say,in the state of pure sentience.

## 5 Integration with the True Energetic Self 

ME:Thank you.You just described what our TES looked like when you were ascending from your physical body.You also stated that you had to "put the brakes on"as a result of the help you had.This means that you are still individualized from our TES. A:Yes,it does. ME:Could you explain what it would be like to integrate with our TES. A:Yes,I still have the knowledge from before our current incarnation.Although somewhat different energetically,the experience would be similar enough to that experienced by the Aspect of a Source Entity TES to be useful to you. In essence,the Aspect of a TES is a specialized function of its overall sentience and the energies that the TES sentience has commandeered or been assigned to.When the Aspect ascends from the physical vehicle,it regains full connectivity from an energetic perspective and the individualized Aspect regains full functionality and memory. When,however,the Aspect reintegrates with its TES,the Aspect loses command of the energies that its individualized sentience was assigned to,and attains access to an area of energy within the TES that is assigned to it within the energetic boundary of the
