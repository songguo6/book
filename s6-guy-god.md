### Foreword（前言） 

When I initially started to write this book, I fully expected to focus on the technical aspects of the universe and not the personal progression side as well. Indeed, the start is very mechanical in nature, which can be seen from the way I initially prepared myself to talk about content that was based upon the physics of the universe with the entities, the Origin and the Source Entity. In the early days I needed to literally count myself up the energetic levels to reach those with whom I would spend the next couple of years communicating. The process would occur via my computer on Friday afternoons unless I was on holiday or out of the UK. The subject matter that we discussed over the years chopped and changed from week to week and has had to be edited to make it flow. I also seemed to develop a style of contacting the entities only long enough to generate only a thousand words or so, plus or minus 10-20%, which was interesting, to say the least. 

最初写这本书时，我一心聚焦于宇宙的技术层面，并没有打算谈及个人提升方面的事。的确，本书一开始大概会有些无趣，从我与各类实体、源头实体（以下简称源实体）以及起源谈论内容的方式可见一斑，因为这些内容主要是基于宇宙的物理学原理的。在最初的一段时日，我需要一层一层的让自己在能量层级上往上提升，才能接触到那些后来与我沟通数年的实体。每周五下午，这个过程都会在我的电脑上上演，除非我在度假或者不在英国。在过去的几年中，我们之间所讨论过的主题内容每周都可能会中断或改变，因此我不得不重新编辑以使其流畅。我似乎也养成了一种习惯，即和实体们联络的时长总是只能够写出千字左右的内容，上下浮动10%至20%。这其实也蛮有趣的。

Some of the chapters are clearly longer than 1,000 words while others are 2,000+ words. This depended upon the difficulty of the subject being discussed, or, in fact, how broad it was. Sometimes these words took a couple of hours to generate with every word being painful. At other times it flowed like a river, and it was all that I could do to keep it in my memory long enough to type it into my computer. As you can imagine, this, in itself, generated a level of frustration that at times could stem the flow of communication. 

当然也有些章节显然是多于1000字的，有些甚至2000多字，字数多少取决于所讨论主题的难度，或更准确的说，取决于主题的深度和广度。有时，一些内容要花好几个小时才能诞生出来，每个字都似乎伴随着阵痛。但有时候，他们又如何留般一泻千里，一发不可收拾。我所做的只是尽量记住它，好敲进我的电脑里。你可以想象这个过程本身会产生一定的挫败感，因为输入这件事只会阻碍沟通的流动。

Nevertheless, I have gotten to the stage now where it is time to cut and run, to publish and be damned. I am not a fan of books that are as thick as door stops as they tend to bore me. As a result, I have a deep sense of not wanting to bore my readers with 600+ pages when they could get more enjoyment out of the staggered introduction of the information that I received. It also gives me a break and allows me to pass it on to my editor, who while I am writing this text, does not know this is about to come over the wall. In actual fact, the reason for stopping here is this:(1) I need a rest; and (2) I want to contact the other Source Entities that have been mentioned in this text with a view to describing their universes and giving the world the opportunity to see the wider reality through their senses and achievements. 

不管怎样，现在到了我该放手抽身的时候，是时候让它出版并接受大众的品评了。我个人可不是个对鸿篇巨制的作品甘之如饴的人，因为他们常常会让我的气力吃不消。所以，如果我的读者可以通过阅读我这些原汁原味的接收到的信息而乐在其中时，何必要用一本六百多页的绞尽脑汁润色修饰的巨著来赶走读者呢？这样，我本人就可以喘口气，并把书稿丢给我那在我落笔的此刻还对本书即将交付一无所知的出版编辑。开个玩笑。事实上我在此时执笔的原因有两个：一，我需要休息；二，我想连接在本书中提到过的其他源实体，好一瞥他们描述的宇宙，使世界有机会通过他们的知觉与成就窥见更广阔的实相。

I apologize for the changes in style as I progressed, but this is how it came to me. I guess that this in some way adds authenticity to it. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy the reading the text and the things that I gleaned as a result of being able to communicate with these entities. 

因此，我要为我写作过程中的多变的文风表示抱歉。但它们原本就是这样来到我这里的，我想这在某种程度上也证实了它的真实性。不过，我希望你们能真正享受这本书，享受我在与各类实体交流中获得的一些感受。

So just what does one do when a channeled work is finished? For one thing, I knew that this would not be the last, for I knew that I personally was interested in the universes that were indicated to be controlled by the other 11 Source Entities, each one trying to understand itself and its creativity and feed its own learning back to the Origin. 

那么当传导工作结束以后，接收者还能做什么呢？首先我知道这不会是我的最后一次传导，因为我个人对其他11个源实体主宰的各个宇宙也很感兴趣，他们的每一员都在努力了解自己和自己的造物，并将所学所获反馈给起源。

Next, it was clear that the concepts that were being presented to me would, in a lot of instances, go straight over my head. Indeed this was the most annoying side of what I was doing, for I really like to understand the mechanics of what I am being shown, no matter how rudimentary that understanding may be. I felt that if I could understand the information being presented to me, then those who read these texts will also understand. I guess the fact that my dear wife, Anne, also understands a great deal of what I have channeled in this book is a result of the high level of understanding that the Source Entity and the Origin have of humanity’s ability to assimilate information in our low frequency existence. In essence, they know what we can digest and offer concepts to wake us up in a manner that we can understand in our limited capacities. 

再者，显然那些呈现给我的概念很多时候都让我无法理解，这的确是我所做的事情中最令人头疼的一面。因为我真的很想了解呈现给我的那些事物的运作机制，哪怕只是粗浅的理解也好。我觉得如果我能理解呈现给我的信息，那么所有阅读本书的读者也会理解。我猜想我挚爱的妻子安妮，也能理解我在本书中传导的大部分内容的原因是源实体和起源非常清楚人类有限的领悟能力，从而能将很多深奥的信息融入到我们所处的低频环境能接受的信息中。实际上，他们知道哪些是我们能消化的，因此会提供在我们有限的能力范围内可以理解的概念来唤醒我们。

I was surprised at the duality of the book as it unfolded. First, I would like to remind the reader that this was supposed to be a work that focused upon the history of God and the universe He/She/It has created. I was not comfortable with the dialogue dipping into the more esoteric aspects of how to live our lives to the best of our ability while being of service to others. Also, there seems to be a strong link between the two subject areas, not because of its spirituality but because of the interconnectedness of living life according to the rules of the universe. Going against the physics of the universe ultimately results in our early demise as physical beings but also irrevocably links us to the lower energies of the physical in a way that is truly difficult to reverse without a significant change in our personal nature. Learning to forgive what others do to us is one of the hardest things to do as is shrugging off the greed that we have acquired from living in a materialistic society; however, these two together are without doubt the route to our own personal evolution and ultimately the evolution of humankind incarnate, the route back to the Source and the Origin. 

另外，我也没想到随着本书的展开，会有如此偶然性的呈现。首先我想提醒读者，这本该是一本有关神及其所创造的宇宙的作品。而对于像如何在服务他人的同时尽可能过好自己的生活这种深奥的对话我其实不太擅长。但是这两方面主题之间似乎又存在很强的关联性，这种关联不单来自于灵性层面，而是来自于跟随宇宙法则生活的内在逻辑。因为违背宇宙的物理学原理不仅会最终导致我们作为物质生命的过早终结，而且还不可避免的将我们与物质世界的低频能量连接起来，这种连接难以反转，除非我们在个体层面上的人性发生了巨大转变。学会宽恕他人对我们的所作所为也是其中最困难的事情之一，这和摆脱我们在物欲横流的社会中养成的贪婪习性一样艰巨。但是毫无疑问，这两者是我们的个人进化以致整个人类化身种族进化的必经之路，也是回归源头和起源的唯一道路。

We have to understand the physics of the universe to understand the esoterics. The two are intertwined as they create the path to correct efficient existence in the other. This helps us go with the flow rather than against it. For this reason, I decided to keep the two types of channeled work under the same cover. The physics and the esoterics. The one provides the living space and how it evolved; the other provides the rules for existence in this space. It would have been logical to create two books and maximize on the sales potential, but that would have been materialistic and would have missed the opportunity for people to have it all in one place, for why would you buy a book when it has only provided one side of the argument and not offered an answer or a way forward? 

有趣的是，为了更好理解所谓的神秘学，我们一定要懂得宇宙的物理学原理。二者互相交织着，创造了校正对方的有效通道。得益于此，我们才能顺流而行，而非逆流而动。因此，我决定在这同一本书中保留两种信息，物理学与神秘学，一个讲述我们生存的空间及其如何演进，另一个讲述我们在此空间中的存在法则。在这个话题上，创作两本书并最大化销量似乎更加选择，但那不仅将是一种唯利是图的行为，也会有读者措施一次性得窥全貌的机会。试想，有谁会买一本只呈现一方论据，却没有给出答案和指引的书呢？

Approximately two years prior to starting this work, I had written some 180 pages of my “meditational meanderings,” some of which I noted later were relevant to this work. These I have also included as I now know that they were, in effect, the start of this dialogue and have their own relevance within the text. As such, they are now fully integrated and help to provide a fuller picture of God’s universes and the energetic creatures that exist within them, each of them helping the Origin to understand Its Self and the universe It created through the Source Entities and ourselves. The universes are truly full and vibrant environments, offering myriad opportunities for entities to evolve and, therefore, grow closer to the Source and go home to be part of the whole, but this can't be done without understanding and working with the rules. In reality, this is what this book tries to do—offer us all a way out of the darkness with a light to help us on our way home.

事实上，在创作本书约两年之前，我已经写过180多页的冥想漫谈。后来我发现其中一些内容与本书有关，因而也将它们囊括进来。我现在理解了，其实那些冥想正是本书对话的开始，而且与本书的内容都有紧密的内在关联。有鉴于此，我将他们做了整合。以便提供一幅更加完整的神之宇宙以及存在其中的能量体造物的画卷，这些造物的每一个都在帮助起源理解自身，理解通过源实体和我们自己所创造出的宇宙，这些宇宙生机勃勃，为各种各样的智慧实体提供了无数进化机会，使他们成长向源头靠近，并最终回归为整体。但是，如果没有对宇宙法则的理解和遵循，这些就无从谈起。事实上，这正是本书想要传达的内容，为所有人指出一条走出黑暗的大道，用光明帮助我们所有人回家。

## Part 1 - The Mechanics of the Origins Universe and Where We Fit In

**第一部分：原初宇宙的运作机制与我们的安身之所**

### The Author Awakens 

**作者的觉醒**

Throughout my life I have been interested in the paranormal; indeed, I had a constant feeling that I was more substantial than my current self. In one of my earliest memories on this subject I distinctly remember being told by my mother that I could not see the wind when I clearly saw it whistling up and over the roof of a building. I practiced meditation as a young teenager and felt that I could astral travel and levitate/perform telekinesis, even though I couldn't when I tried. I had previously awakened several times in dreams to find that I was out of my body, levitating at will, outside our house. In my late teens I practiced meditation diligently every night trying to gain control of the faculties I was sure I had. Then one morning I had a waking dream. In this dream four white robed individuals stood before me, each of them smiling. They communicated with me by telepathy and told me that all that I believed in was correct. I could do everything I felt that I could do, but not yet! They told me that it was not the right time and that I needed to learn my Earthly lessons first. From that day forward, my interest in the paranormal waned, and I concentrated on doing the best I could in the physical world. That is, until a friend introduced me to Reiki, which led me to other energy healing arts. I became a student of a direct student of Barbara Brennan. My interest was reawakened! 

纵观我的一生，我一直对超自然现象感兴趣。事实上我一直有种感觉，那就是我比目前的自己更广大。在我早期的记忆中，我清楚的记得母亲告诉我说风是看不见的，但是我却清楚的看到呼啸而起的风从建筑物的屋顶上翻过。十几岁的时候，我练习冥想时，感到我能进行星光体旅行，漂浮，还能心灵感应，尽管在现实中我屡试不成。我曾有几次在梦中醒来，发觉自己离开了肉身，可以随意在房子外面漂浮。在接下来的少年时光，我每晚刻苦练习冥想，想掌握这些我确信自己拥有的能力。后来一天早上，我做了一个清明梦，在梦里有四个身穿白色长袍的人站在我面前，每个人都面带笑意。他们用心灵感应和我交流，告诉我说，我相信的那些事情都是真的，我能做到一切我认为自己可以做到的事情，只是暂时还没有做到而已。他们告诉我时间未到，我首先要学习地球上的功课。从那天开始，我对于超自然现象的兴趣消退了，我则竭尽所能致力于在物质世界做到最好。就这样直到多年以后，一个朋友将灵气介绍给我，我又因此接触到另一些能量疗愈技术。我跟随芭芭拉布莱能的亲传学生学习，而我对超自然现象的兴趣也再次被唤醒。

During the years of being trained in the energy healing arts, I noticed that I could sense and feel energies. Not only this, I could talk to the chakras to find out what was wrong with them and sense other entities. I also noticed that I could go well above the energy levels taught me by my teacher and was, subsequently, reprimanded for not staying grounded. The problem was that it felt right to be up there. 

在接受能量疗愈技术训练的几年间，我发现自己能感知到能量。不仅如此，我还能与脉轮对话，以找出其问题所在，还能感知到其他实体。我还发现我能够超越老师教导的能量层级，当然也因此被谴责为不够脚踏实地。问题是我觉得我在那些更高层级上的感觉是对的。

### The Author Meets the Om

**作者与OM相遇**

It was during one of my initial healing course meditations with a guest instructor that I first met the Om and was identified by a fellow student as being one of them. Little did I know that during a trip to see a friend who was working in Sweden, I would have the connections I required to communicate with energy beings and manipulate energy, thanks to a group of aliens.

我第一次与OM相遇是在我早期与一位客座老师一起做疗愈课程冥想时，被一个同学确认说我是OM的一员。我完全不知道自己会在去看望一位在瑞典工作的朋友时，在一群外星人的帮助下，建立起与能量存有沟通的连接，并能操控能量。


### Chapter 1 - Sweden, a Reawakening 

**第1章：瑞典，觉醒**

The energy at my friend’s house in Sweden was high. It was surrounded by ley line energy which was not connected and was moving around wildly, rather like a high tension wire whipping across the land, grounding out. The stones at the bottom of his garden felt like they were part of a shrine that focused and directed the ley line energies (rather like the stones at Avebury and Kilmartin). I felt energized. 

瑞典朋友家中的能量很强，周围环绕着的地脉能量像是没有连接般的四处移动，如同没有接地的高压电线抽打着碾过地面的样子。花园尽头的岩石感觉就像是聚焦和引导地脉能量的圣地的一部分（像埃夫伯里和基尔马丁巨石阵中的石头）。我感觉被充满了能量。

#### The Author’s Attunement by Aliens to Balance Other World and Earth Energies 

**作者被外星人调谐以平衡其他世界和地球的能量**

One day, during a walk with my wife and my friend, I felt the need to go to a certain rock which was by the river. The river was in a small valley. At the rock I had a desire to sit in the lotus position whilst meditating. During the deepest meditation that I had ever experienced, I sensed a lot of light come into my head and my eyes flicker uncontrollably. A voice in my head told me I was being attuned to the Earth energies and that I should stay calm. I also had the impression that a craft of some sort was hovering in front of me. The impression was validated when I saw the strange movement of the water just after I came out of the meditation. 

一天在与妻子和友人散步时，我感觉需要去河边的一块岩石那里。河流位于一个小山谷中，到了岩石那里，我强烈的想采用莲花座进行冥想。这次的冥想是我所体验过的最深入的一次，当时我感到有大量的光照射进头部，眼睛也不受控制的闪动着。这时脑子里有一个声音告诉我，我正在被调节至地球能量，并要我保持镇静。我还有个印象是面前有某种飞行物在盘旋，冥想结束时我看到了水流的移动，这证实了这一印象。

During the time I was in meditation on the rock, my wife, who is also quite sensitive, was standing on a suspension bridge upstream. She said she perceived a number of UFOs approach the area, which was a portal between universes. The bridge was at the point of a triangle/cone, and the UFOs were coming in towards the point. She further stated that she was told that the aliens wanted to communicate with me to give me “other world ways of using energy.” To do this, she said they worked directly on me (particularly my brain)—the word rewiring came into mind. After a while, she felt the UFOs leaving and the portal closing. My friend, who also practices the healing arts, said that the stone I was on was aligned to a point on the bridge, and that this was where the energy flow was. He said it was as though the energy collected at the point by the bridge was channelled into the hill via the stone in the river. 

我在石头上冥想期间，我的妻子一直站在上游的一座吊桥上，他也对能量十分敏感。她说，她感知到有相当数量的不明飞行物靠近这片区域，而这里是宇宙间的门户。吊桥位于三角形锥形的顶点，不明飞行物正是朝着这个点飞过来。她还说她被告知外星人想要与我沟通，告诉我另一个世界运用能量的方法。为此，他们直接对我（尤其是大脑）施工，重新接线这个词进入脑海。片刻之后，她感到了UFO的离开和宇宙门户的关闭。我的朋友也是从事疗愈工作的，他说，我打坐的那块岩石正好与桥的一个点对齐，而那个点也正是能量流所在之处。他说能量好像是被桥聚集在那个点，然后通过河里那块石头流向小山。

A year later I was travelling to Sweden again with my friend as a travelling companion as he had moved back to the UK. During the journey I meditated. I logged into the aliens; they were excited that I was coming, and I heard a voice in my head saying, “He is/they are coming.” Beforehand, a strange feeling had come over us in the hours around 11:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. before the flight. Both my friend and I felt a bit lethargic (stunned) and weren't able to think straight. I now know that this was a result of tapping into the energies that the aliens were using, which at that time were overwhelming. I thought I was coming down with a bug or something. As a result, I mixed up the flight times, and we missed the flight. I wondered if perhaps we were supposed to miss the flight for other reasons. Maybe we missed an accident or something. I never did check to see if there were any traffic accidents. Maybe I would have arrived at the wrong time for the aliens and their plans. Maybe I’ll never know. I’m sure there was a reason. We finally caught a flight the next day and arrived without issue. 

一年后，朋友搬回了英国，我们再次结伴前往瑞典。旅行途中我进行冥想。在那次冥想中，我去见了那些外星人，他们对我的拜访甚感兴奋。我听到一个声音在我脑子里说，他们到来了。在这之前，也就是飞机起飞前的上午11点到中午12点前，曾经有种奇怪的感觉向我们袭来，我和朋友都感到无精打采，昏昏欲睡，无法清晰思考。我现在才知道，那是因为我们接入了外星人所使用的能量，这能量对我们来说太强了。我以为是我的身体哪里出了问题。结果把航班时间搞混了，导致错过了飞机。我当时还想是不是有什么别的原因注定让我们错过那次航班，比如避开事故什么的，我后来也没有特意去核实是不是发生了什么交通事故。也许对于外星人及他们的计划来说，我以原定的时间到达会不合适，也许是我永远不会知道的原因，但我确信这件事是有原因的。终于，我们在第二天赶上另一班飞机，顺利抵达瑞典。


The next day while we were walking towards the river and bridges where the aliens' portal was located, I had the feeling that they were accessing me, especially my autonomic functions. As we walked along the river side path, I felt energy in my hands and arms increase. My friend said that he felt we were going through waves of energy. When we arrived at the bridge, we both knew that the aliens were coming through the portal. I then received a command in my head and walked back down to the rock I had sat on the previous year. I was told that I should expect nothing strange or anticipate anything special/strange happening because this would block the work that they would be doing—more fine tuning and opening of my skills and abilities/functions. As I continued my walk to the rock, I saw images in my mind’s eye of aliens working with machinery and computers. They were getting the machine and equipment ready and tuned into me for when I arrived at the allotted place. 

第二天，当我和朋友走向外星人门户所在的河与桥，我感觉他们在连接我，特别是连接我的自主功能。因为当我们沿着河边小路行走时，我感到双手与双臂的能量在增强。朋友则说，他觉得我们像是在穿过一波又一波的能量。当我们到达桥那里时，我们两个都知道外星人正在通过门户过来。接着，我脑中接到指令，让我回到一年前曾经坐过的那块石头上。我被告知不要期待什么奇异的事，也不用指望发生什么特别的事，因为这会阻碍他们所要进行的工作，也就是更精准的调教与开启我的能力和功能。当我继续朝着岩石走时，我的意识眼中浮现出了外星人正在用机械和电脑工作的画面。他们要在我到达指定位置的时候做好准备工作，将这些机器设备调成适应于我的状况。

Once at the rock, I made myself comfortable, sat in a lotus type position and meditated. I eventually had the impression that the aliens were working on my third eye and were fully opening it so that I could see properly. I was told that this would happen slowly over the next five to ten years. They further told me that they had to attune my third eye to the present time line as it was capable of seeing past, present, and future. They said that I would get confused with seeing this more complex level of information. Suddenly I felt they had turned on my hearing and noticed that, for a split second, I could hear my friend’s thoughts as he stood by the bridge. Then a series of instructions were transmitted to me. I was being told that I should not hang onto any one function that I would receive and that I was to treat each one as a tool and not as my world task or my work or only ability. The initial attuning work in 2002 needed some time to stabilize before it could be turned on. 

走到岩石那里，我让自己舒服的以莲花坐盘坐在石头上面开始冥想。我最后的印象是外星人对我的三眼轮做工作，并使它完全开启，以便我能真正看见。我被告知这是一个缓慢的过程，将会持续5到10年。他们还告诉我，他们必须将我的第三眼调教到当前时间线，因为我原本能够看到过去、现在和未来。他们说，看到太复杂的信息会让我感到困惑。这时我突然感到外星人开启了我的听觉系统，并注意到自己瞬间能听到站在桥边的朋友的内心想法，接着又传来一系列指令。比如我不能执着于任何一种我即将接收的功能，我应当把每项能力当做是工具，而不是我在这个世界的使命、事业或者唯一能力。2002年的首次调节需要一段时间的稳定之后，能力才会完全开启。

#### Alien Dimensional Warping Device

**外星维度扭曲装置**

I opened my eyes, and as I did, I noticed my vision was a bit wobbly at my left and right hand side as if my vision was out of phase with the normal visible spectrum. I thought I saw a large orange object in front of the trees in front of me. The object had no form. I just managed to see similar objects in other parts of the tree-lined bank. Suddenly I picked out the outline of an object that I can only describe as machine like. It was totally invisible, but for a split second or two, I saw its outline and its 3D depth of perception. The aliens told me that they were using some sort of dimensional warping device that made it blend into the background. However, if you had the ability, you would just be able to see its outline as it mirrored the visual appearance of its surroundings. I also noticed that although there was a bit of wind, the trees in the area of the objects were moving like they were being blown by the downwash of a helicopter’s blade. I was then told that I shouldn't try to see these things too hard as I would put too great a strain on the tuning and alignment work they had done. 

当我睁开眼睛，我发现视觉在左右两侧有点晃动，好像视力不在正常的可见光谱内。我觉得我看到一个巨大的橙色物体就在我面前的树的前方，这个物体没有形状可言，我在树木成型的河岸等其他地方也看到了类似的物体。突然，我看清了这个物体的轮廓，看上去像是个机器模样，但是完全隐形的。但在某一瞬间，我得以看到它的轮廓，感知到它的三维形态。外星人告诉我，他们使用某种维度扭曲装置，使它可以融入背景环境。当然，如果你有能力，就可以看到它的轮廓，因为它像镜子般反射了其周围环境的视觉外观。我还注意到，尽管这个地方只有一些微风，但是那个物体所在区域的树木都摆动的像是被直升机螺旋桨的下降气流所煽动一样。我被告知，不要太过用力的去看这些东西，这会给他们刚刚做好的调谐和校准工作制造太多压力。

Its visual appearance was like an upside down triangle with a round top and some protrusions on the bottom that I can only describe as being sensor or antenna-like. The trees and surrounding rocks looked as if they were on a convex plate or lens. 

它的外形像一个倒置的三角形，顶部是圆的，底部有一些突出，我觉得像是传感器或是天线一类。树木以及周围的岩石看上去就好像处在一个凸起的平面或者透镜上。
 
To help the reader understand what I saw, the outline of the craft is in the illustration below. 

为了帮助读者理解我所看到的，飞行器的轮廓如下图所示。

![图1：看到的飞船轮廓示意图](img/s6-017.png)
 
The trees within the internal vicinity of the outline of the craft effectively stood out from their usual environment. 

飞船轮廓内部的树木与它们通常所处的环境截然不同。
 
#### A Dimension Within a Dimension 

**维度套叠**
 
As we sat on the rock before going back to my friend’s house, we both felt that the aliens lived here in a complex that was within the hillside and supported by dimensional mechanics. That is, it is a dimension within a dimension, and that this was a local phenomenon.

在返回朋友住处之前，我们坐在石头上，我们都觉得外星人的住所就在这里，在位于山腹的有维度设备支持的建筑群中，也就是说这是一个维度套叠，是一种此处的特有现象。
 
My friend said that he thought the rock was a focal loci for energy between two dimensions and that the rocks either side of the bridge were special because they allow the transference of energies (spiritual, cosmic and Earth) to occur and blend together, creating an inter-dimensional portal. He also thought the abilities of these rocks in this configuration on Earth was rare; therefore, this was a special place. 

朋友认为那块岩石是两个维度之间的能量焦点，而且桥两侧的石头也是与众不同的，因为他们可以让灵性的、宇宙的和地球的能量得以传导并融合，从而创造出一个跨维度的门户。他还认为地球上这种结构的岩石所拥有的能力十分罕见，因此这里肯定是一个殊胜之地。

For a day or so after both of these attunements, I felt very wobbly and could hardly string a sentence together, like being mildly drunk. It was a very strange feeling. 

在这两次调节后的一两天，我感到精神恍惚，几乎不能把一句话说完整，像是轻度醉酒的感觉，那是一种不可思议的感受。

#### Some Independent Proof：A Contract with Aliens 

**与外星人接触的一些独立证据**

A few months later, I showed some pictures of the landscape around the river and rock in Sweden to a medium I was visiting in the College of Psychic Studies in London. I had not previously talked to her of aliens and my association with them. She immediately recognized the presence of aliens there and clearly stated that I had a contract with them. It was shortly after the visit to the College of Psychic Studies that I started the Barbara Brennan-based energy healing courses where I learned to use some of my abilities and started communication with energy-based entities, two of which are the Source Entity and the Origin.

几个月后，我在拜访伦敦灵学研究学院时，给一个灵媒看了一些瑞典那条河和岩石周围的风景照片。事先我并没有跟她提过外星人以及我与外星人的联系，她立刻就认出那里有外星人出现，并且很肯定的说，我和外星人之间定有契约。在访问伦敦灵学研究学院后没多久，我开始学习芭芭拉·布南能体系的能量疗愈课程，并学会了使用我的一些能力，开始与一些能量形态的实体交流，其中就包括源实体和起源。

### Chapter 2 - Contacts with Beings on the 14th Through the 27th Levels 

**第2章：与第14级到第27级的存有接触**

#### Building My Link to Spirit and the 20th Level 

**建立通往灵与第20级的连接**

Over the course of many meditations I often tried to clear my mind to help allow the helpers and other entities from all the other dimensions to connect me or make my link to Spirit. It was during one of these meditations that I noticed their help in action. At the start of this particular meditation, as I allowed myself to be at peace, I noticed a couple of cherub-like entities building what I can only describe as a scaffold of one pole or an antenna like that on a car or transistor radio. It was as if they were putting all the pieces or links together one by one—putting them together until they eventually were high enough to go into the ionosphere and beyond. Each time I let my mind wander and lost focus on the greater reality, it would be as if they would be held in suspended animation. When I pulled myself back into meditation, I would see them start up again with vigor, delighting in the fact that they were able to start building again. As I came back each day, the antenna or link got higher and higher until it was outside our solar system. When I projected myself to the top of it, I could see the rest of my home galaxy below me. When I looked at this construction (2004), I started to see the rest of the other galaxies in my universe coalescing into a single ball of light. When I asked Earth’s Source Entity (you’ll hear more about this Entity soon) about this, He/She/It was very pleased and was surprised at the speed at which I was able to make progress in my meditations—which subsequently helped my helpers to make my link. 

多数时候在冥想的过程中，我会清空头脑，以便允许各个维度的帮手以及实体与我连接，或者让我连接灵体。正是在某一次冥想中，我发现了他们帮助我的过程。在那次冥想开始时，当我让自己平静下来，我发现有几个像小天使一样的实体在建造一种装置，我只能形容为一根杆子做的支架，像汽车或晶体管收音机天线的东西，他们像是在把所有部件或连接一个个拼起来，直到穿过电离层。每当我杂念纷飞，忘记了专注于更大的实相时，他们就好像暂停了。而当我将自己拉回到冥想状态，我就会看到他们又活跃起来，未能重新开始建造而欢欣鼓。我每天冥想这个天线或连接就变得越来越高，直到超出了太阳系。当我以星光体投射的方式来到它的顶端，看到我所居住的星系在我下方一览无遗，我继续盯着这个构造看（当时是2004年），于是看到我们这个宇宙的其他星系正聚集融合成一个光球。当我询问地球所处的源实体（接下来你会了解到关于这个实体的更多信息）这是怎么回事时。他/她/它非常高兴，并对我的冥想进展如此神速感到惊喜，因为这将有助于我的守护灵帮我建立连接。

Note: During the editing of this text for publication (February, 2011), I noticed that the link had progressed beyond the physicality of our universe. The single pole had split off like the branches of a tree, creating a web-like network of connections that ventured through the multiverse of our Source Entity and beyond to the Source Entities’ creator, the Origin, and the eleven other Source Entities (again you will read about the Origin and Its creations later), and the environments They created. It was an amazing sight to behold. Momentarily I felt the Origin as It smiled Its approval. GSN. 

注：在2011年2月编辑的这些内容准备发表时，我发现连接已经进展到超出了我们这个宇宙的物理状态。原本的一根天线也如同树枝般分岔，形成网络状的连接，它穿过源实体的多维宇宙，到达源实体的创造者，即绝对起源（稍后，你将了解绝对起源及其更多内容），以及其他11个源实体和他们所创造的多样环境。这真是令人叹为观止的景象。此时，我瞬间感受到绝对起源正微笑着对我表示嘉许。

#### The 20th Level - Traveling Through the Crown Chakra to the 20th Level 

**第20级 - 穿越顶轮到第20级**

The extension of my ability resulting from the construction of this scaffold was illustrated during a morning meditation by an old apple tree in our garden, I had grounded myself by taking in Earth hara line energy through my Tan Tien and was opening up all my chakras when I received the impression that I should also open my higher chakras. To do this, I imagined a trap door that opened upwards above my crown chakra, and I would go through it to the next level. Opening and spinning the chakras was a method I was taught as part of my healing training to assist in raising my frequency levels to those of the levels in the aura or chakra I wanted to work with. I counted up, eight, nine, ten, eleven, etc., to the 15th level where I had been before and then had the impression that I could go higher. I continued to count up the chakras to level 20. At this point I could go no further and felt that this was the highest level I could go to at the moment. 

一次在花园老苹果树旁的晨间冥想，说明建造这个连接的脚手架使我的能力得以拓展。我让地球哈拉线能量线通过我的丹田使自己接地，并且打开我的所有脉轮。同时我接受到一种感觉，需要开放我的更高脉轮。为了做到这一点，我想象在顶轮上方有一个向上打开的天窗，我可以通过它到达下一个层级。打开与旋转脉轮是我在疗愈课程中所学的一部分，它能帮助我提升频率，到达我想要运作的能量场或脉轮所在的层级。我不断提升，8、9、10、11，直到我曾到过的第15级，然后我有种感觉我可以去到更高，于是我继续往上计数，将脉轮提升到第20级，这时我无法继续往前，我感到这应该是此时此刻我能达到的最高层级了。

#### A Bypass from the 14th to the 20th Level 

**第14级到第20级之间的支路**

Upon arrival, I thought about the level where the Om came from and realized that I had just gone straight past it (the 14th level is where I first encountered the Om). I then had the impression that I could create a link of pipe between the 14th and 20th levels so that the Om could come up to the 20th level. I then received the impression that they had, in fact, come up the pipe to my level. I also had the impression that this was the way wormholes are used in the physical levels. A pipe goes from one level to another and then back to the original level but in a different location which then allows instantaneous travel between distant points in the same reality. The Om answered. 

到达第20级时，我想着OM是从哪个层级来的，马上就意识到我刚刚经过（我第一次遇到OM是在第14级）。于是我觉得我可以在第14级与第20级之间建立一个连接管道，这样OM就可以直接上到第20级了。然后我感觉到他们其实已经通过管道来到我所在的层级了。我还感觉到这就是物质层面虫洞的使用方式，即管道从一个层级到达另一个层级，然后再从不同位置返回最初的层级，这样就可以实现同一实相内相距遥远的两点之间的瞬间移动。这是OM给我的回答。

Om: Om originally came from the 14th but can go up to the 20th and beyond. The only reason that you first encountered us on the 14th was that we needed to go down to the 14th to meet you. You only just understood that there was a 14th level and didn't even consider that there was a 20th. The 14th level is the lowest we can descend because going lower is painful and energy-depleting for us. Going any lower requires incarnation into the physical bodies relative to that frequency. The Om made a big sacrifice by coming this far down in the frequencies, and because of that, you are special. Although it was a big sacrifice, it was essential to their work here on Earth. 

OM：OM原本是来自第14级的，但也能上升到第20级甚至更高。你之所以会在第14级首次遇到我们，只不过是因为我们需要下降到那个层级才能和你相遇，你那时才刚刚知道有个第14级，连想都没想过还有第20级。第14级是我们能去到的最低层级，因为对我们来说，去的层级越低就越痛苦，也越耗费能量。要降到再低的层级中都需要转世化身为与那个层级频率匹配的物质身体中。为了来到如此之低的频率与你相见，我们做出了巨大牺牲。所以你真的很特殊，尽管牺牲很大，这对我们在地球的工作来说还是很有必要的。

I felt that other beings, including my guides, were present as well. I asked them why I couldn't see any stars or galaxies at this level (the 20th). They said there weren't any as such at this level and that if I dropped down to the 14th level, I would see them again. This I did momentarily, and I again found myself at the far end of the galaxy (the Om were with me). I returned to the 20th. 

我感到还有其他实体，包括我的指导灵也都在场。我问他们为什么这里（第20级）看不到恒星或者星系？他们说在这个层级不会有这些，当然如果我降到第14级，那么我会再次见到它们。一瞬间我就降到了第14级，果然发现自己又站在银河系的尽头了，（OM一直和我在一起），我又返回到第20级。

Om: You are not ready to and are not able to perceive or understand at this level whilst in your earthly body, so the area looks black; however, it serves its purpose. You can get up to that level and communicate without a problem. 

OM：你在地球身体里是无法感知与理解第20级的，所以这个区域看起来一片漆黑。不过它有它存在的意义，现在你可以上升到这个层级，并且无障碍的交流了。

I was then told that this was enough for that day, and I zipped down the levels and back into my body. 

然后我被告知那天的接触已经足够多了，于是我快速穿过那些层级回到身体中。

#### Slipping into Various Dimensions and Universes 

**滑入多样的维度和宇宙**

Another meditation saw me rising up to the 20th level. I looked around in my mind’s eye to see if anyone was there, only to find that I was surrounded by entities. Om and others whom I could not identify were present. They were all pleased and honored to meet me. (I was starting to be embarrassed by this.) I also expected to see many stars and galaxies as I do when I visit the 15th level, but I received the answer that the neutral color I was seeing in place of the stars and galaxies was because I was in all levels and all universes/dimensions at the same time. This surprised me, but it did make sense. I then made sure that I was grounded. When I focused my attention on a star system in a particular galaxy, I found that I could go there at will. Slipping into different dimensions/universes was like slipping through the layers of a spherical Russian doll. On my way to another planet, I saw a couple of space ships; one was like a flying saucer and the other like an orb of light. I went into the ship that was like an orb and found myself in a control room of sorts. There I was met by three beings of humanoid shape with big black eyes who bowed with hands together as if in prayer when they noticed I was with them. They also said that they were pleased to see me. I asked them if they knew why I was on Earth, and they said that I was there to evolve. I then asked what my job on Earth was, and they said it was to help the Earth and its inhabitants to evolve. They said that everything would become apparent when the time was right, when I had learned my lessons and had a firm foundation. I then thought about my task in life, and they said I could do two or three world tasks, including my own evolution, all at once because I am multidimensional. This was funny to me because at that time I had been having the feeling that I had been living three or four lives at once! 

还有一次冥想中，我上升到第20级，我用意识眼环顾四周，看是否有人在这里。我发现自己被一群实体围在中间，OM以及其他我无法辨认的实体都在场，他们对与我相遇都感到高兴和荣幸（这倒让我开始有点不好意思了）。我原本以为我会在第15级看到很多恒星和星系，但是我得到的回答是，在原本恒星和星系所在之处我看到的中性无彩色，是因为我同时处在所有层级、所有宇宙和所有维度。这令我感到惊奇，但确实言之有理。接下来，我确保自己做好了接地。我发现，当我将注意力集中于某一星系的恒星系统，我可以随意去到那里。滑入不同的维度或者宇宙，就好像是在一层层的球形俄罗斯套娃中穿行。在去另一个行星的途中，我看到两艘太空船，其中一艘像是飞碟，而另一艘则像个光球。我进入了那艘像是光球的飞船，发现自己来到一个像控制室一样的地方，我在那里遇到了三个实体，他们是人形的，但有着大大的黑色眼睛。当他们发现我来到他们身边时，就双手合十鞠躬致意，说很高兴见到我。我问他们是否知道我为什么要生活在地球，他们说我在那里是为了进化。接着我问我在地球上的使命是什么，他们说是帮助地球及其居民进化。他们还说，当我完成了自己的功课，有了稳固的根基，时机成熟，一切都会明了。当我思考到自己的人生使命时，他们说，我可以做2或3个世界任务，包括我自己的进化。这些能同时完成，因为我是一个多维度的实体。这很有意思，因为那时我确实有一种感觉，就是我同时过着三四个不同的人生。

Later when walking to my car to go to work, I had the impression that we evolve faster by incarnating here on Earth because of the short life span and subsequent accelerated learning opportunities. I then noticed that I felt a bit spaced out and heady. This I supposed was because of the level that I was working with. It was good that I was grounded! 

后来，当我走向我的车子要去上班的时候，我有了一种感觉，即投胎地球使我们进化更快，是因为人类短暂的生命以及随后的不断加速出现的学习机会。然后我又觉得自己有些恍惚和头晕，我猜这是受到我所去过的能量层级的影响，还好我接地做的不错。

#### The Power of Thought 

**思想的力量**

The next day when I opened my chakras in the same way, I was aware that I was literally bursting my way through the trap doors that allowed access to the higher levels. When I got to level 20, I stopped and looked around. Again I was surrounded by beings, but this time I had the impression it was just the Om. 

第二天，当我以同样的方式开启我的脉轮，我发现自己几乎是迸射着穿过了顶轮的那个顶部天窗，进入了更高层级。当我到达第20级时，我停了下来，环顾四周，这次我仍然是被一堆实体们环绕着，不过这次我觉得他们都是OM。

Om: We are both surprised and pleased in the progress you have made in this short period of time. You are progressing faster than anticipated. 

OM：我们对你在短时间内取得的进展感到惊喜，你进步的比预期要快。

ME: Why do you say “we”? 

我：为什么你说“我们”？

Om: Because We answer collectively, not singularly. 

OM：因为我们是集体在回答，而非以单独个体。

ME: Why are you surprised? 

我：你们为什么会感到惊讶？

Om: Because the 20th level is very high, and you have to be very grounded. You are learning fast; you are awakening fast. It will not be long before you are fully aware. But don't try too hard as this will block your progression. 

OM：因为第20级是非常高的，你必须事先很好的接地。你学得很快，觉醒得也很快，很快你就能彻底觉醒。但是也不要用力过猛，因为这样反倒会阻碍你前进。

ME: So where am I now? 

我：那么我现在是在哪里？

Om: You are everywhere, in all places at once. 

OM：你同时在所有地方，你无处不在。

I looked out at the universe and found that each universe was represented as a separate sphere. 

我朝外望向宇宙，发现每个宇宙都呈现为一个单独的球体。

ME: It must take a long time to travel between the universes? 

我：在宇宙间穿行要花很长时间？

Om: Traveling in a higher frequency is easier because the molecules are further apart and create less friction; therefore, they allow you to travel much faster—as fast as the speed of thought. 

OM：在较高的频率中穿行会比较容易，因为分子之间距离较大，产生的摩擦较小，所以你可以穿行的更快，就像思想的速度那么快。

This confirmed what I had previously received and understood in meditation. 

这也证实了之前我在冥想中所获得与理解的信息。

Om: We use the power of thought a lot. Thought has three parts: thought, intention and action. Thought is the start of the process and initiates the desire. Intention focuses the thought and gives it inertia. Action is the end product, thought taken form. 

OM：我们大量使用思想的力量，思想由三部分组成：思想、意愿和行动。思维是整个过程的起点，它启动了欲求。意愿使思想聚焦，赋予其惯性。而行动是最终的产物，使思想得以显化。

ME: Why do I need to know this? 

我：为什么要知道这些呢？

Om: Because it is a universal process, and it is one that you will need to understand and fully believe in the future. 

OM：因为这是一个普遍的宇宙法则，也是你将来需要理解并全然相信的一点。

#### The Effect of Alcohol on Evolution 

**酒精对进化的影响**

I had been thinking about being able to drink the real ale that I love and how it affects contact with my higher self and other beings, including my ability to rise up to the higher levels. I asked the Om a question on this. 

我一直在想我还能不能喝我喜爱的鲜啤酒，不知道这会如何影响我与我的高我和其他实体的连接，以及对我提升到更高层级能力的影响，我向OM提出了这个问题。

ME: What part does alcohol have with me? 

我：酒精对我会有什么影响？

Om: It clouds the communication between your physical and higher self. It removes your intention and, therefore, your focus. 

OM：会遮蔽你的物质身体与高我之间的交流，它会移除你的意愿，并因此使你失去聚焦。

ME: Do I drink too much? 

我：我算不算喝的太多？

Om: You were on the verge of it. We do not understand this need to poison your bodies, but your method of limitation and extending your “dry days” slowly over a period of time is a good way of removing dependence. 

OM：你算是接近了。我们不理解为什么要毒害自己的身体，但是你所使用的限制饮酒量逐渐延长无酒日的方法，可以很好的戒除对酒精的依赖。

ME: I try to give myself three to four dry days a week now, but I still like a tipple with my friends. 

我：我现在尽量让自己保持一周有三四天不沾酒，但是我仍然喜欢和朋友们一起来两杯。

Om: Poisoning yourself to be sociable is a very foreign concept to us. 

OM：为了社交而毒害自己，对我们来说实在是一个陌生的概念。

I had to go to work then and came down the frequencies by diving down through the trap doors that represented the higher levels until I got to the 7th and my body. The grounding must have worked as I did not feel heady this time. 

我要去上班了，于是我从高频率层级往下俯冲，穿过那个象征更高层级的顶轮天窗，直到第7级，回到我的身体。这次的接地看来起作用了，因为我没有感到头晕。

#### The God Collective 

**神之集体**

Another meditation saw me rising through the levels to the 20th level. I was jumping up the levels in a series of uneven numbers: 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17 & 20th. This I found surprising and wondered for a moment why this was. I was suddenly told that this was because of my intention. I was reminded of the three stages of thought: thought, intention, and action. 

在另一次冥想里，我上升到第20级，我是按照随机的级数跳级上去的，第7、9、12、13、15、17，直到第20级。这让我很惊奇，想了一下为何如此突然。有个声音告诉我，这是由于我的意愿。我因此会想起了思想的三个阶段：思想、意愿和行动。

ME: Who am I talking to? One of the Om? 

我：谁在和我讲话？是OM，或是其中的一员吗？

HSME (Higher Self ME): In a figure of speech, yes, but it is you. You are speaking to your higher self and your higher self is Om. 

高我：从修辞角度来说，是的，但其实就是你自己，你在与你的高我对话，而你的高我就是OM。

ME: I wonder what we are going to talk about today? 

我：我好奇今天我们会聊些什么呢？

HSME: We can talk about whatever you like. It depends upon whether you want it to be about mundane or interesting things. 

高我：我们可以聊任何你喜欢的话题，这取决于你想让它单调还是有趣。

ME: Should I wait until I am at my computer before I start to talk to you, so that I can remove the forgetting bits and pieces process. 

我：等我在电脑旁边时，我们再开始对话行吗？这样可以防止我遗忘与你交谈的细节。

HSME: You can if you want, but would you have the time to do it? This works for you and not all of the information you get will be required to be presented in the conversational format. 

高我：如果你想这样做，当然可以，但你来得及吗？这方法虽然管用，但不是所有你获得的信息都必须以对话的形式呈现出来。

ME: Why pick that method? 

我：那为什么还要选择对话方式呢？

HSME: Because it makes it easier to read and, therefore, accessible to everyone, not just the intellectuals. The conversational method is a very good way of conveying the information you will be receiving to the general public. 

高我：因为这样比较方便阅读，因此它适合所有人，而不仅仅是知识分子。对话方式可以很好的向大众传达你将接收到的信息。

I then saw an image of a bacterium, which was round in shape, with billions of small tentacles surrounding its periphery. 

于是我看到一个圆形细菌的画面，它的外围长满了无数细小的触须。

HSME: That’s right. That is a good image to use to describe what we are. We are all tendrils or sensors of the main entity going out to learn information and bring it back to the whole. Some of us want to return, and some want to remain in the learning/experiencing loop or even help other tendrils in their process of learning/experience. Do note that we still retain our singularity even though we are part of a collective, as our knowledge gained is specific to one Source and that Source can be recognized. 

高我：没错，这个图像可以恰到好处的描述出我们是什么，我们就像是主实体的触须或传感器或去获取信息，并把信息带回给整体。我们中有些想要回到源头，有些则想要留在学习和体验的循环中，或者帮助其他在学习和体验中的触须。请注意，尽管我们是集体的一部分，但我们仍然保有自己的独特个性，因为我们所获取的知识对于所属源头来说是独一无二的，这个源头也因此而与众不同。

ME: You just said “we.” I thought we are all one. How can God be “we”? Does that mean there are other Gods? 

我：你刚才说“我们”，我以为我们都是一起的，但神怎么能是“我们”？难道说还有其他神？

I was having difficulty seeing how big this was in terms of how the universes/or continuum could create more than one god-like entity. My limited Earth mental capacity was truly limiting my ability to understand this concept. 

我当时很难想象到，宇宙或者无限连续体要创造出更多神一样的存在，需要多宏大的工程？我这有限的地球心智能力真是限制了我对这个事情的理解。

HSME: If you would take a temporal or dimensional slice of the cake at any one time, you would see Us, we the God collective, as separate entities separated by thin slices of dimensional layers or time. Don't forget that although time is an Earth concept, it will do for this explanation. All you would be doing is seeing parts of Us, We, Me, God (the bigger part of us) through different layers of reality. Separate out all these realities, and you have many Gods/beings. Put them all together, and you get one being, one God that exists in all times, in all spaces, in all dimensions, in all continuums at the same time. Consider the total entity or God as a tall building, the number of floors representing the total number of dimensional realities that I, We, God encompass. Each floor is a reality all of its own with people/civilizations working and living on that one level only. The beings on a particular floor experience Me, We, God only at that one level, that one part of God that covers all of their level of existence, one level of the building. Put all the levels together, and you make a tall building or an entity that covers all of the beings in all of the levels all at the same time. That is what We, You, God is—an entity that is literally everywhere simultaneously. The point is to get as many people in the world questioning their environment and paradigm as possible. 

高我：任何时候，你在时间或空间的薄片里都可以看到我们神的集体，我们就像是被维度层或时间薄片分开的单独实体。不要忘记，虽然时间只是地球上的一个概念，但对于这个解释也是适用的。你将要做的一切就是通过不同层级的实相去看清我们的各部分，你可称之为我们、我或者神，我们更大的那一部分。将所有这些实相分开来，你就得到了许多神或实体。将它们置于一体，你又会拥有一个唯一的实体，一个同时存在于所有时间、所有空间、所有维度、所有连续体的神。你可以把全部实体或神想象成一座高楼，楼层数代表我们和神所包含的所有维度实相的总数。每层楼都是自成一体的实相，其中生活和工作着只属于那一层级的人或者文明。所以某个楼层的实体只会经验那一层的我、我们和神，涵盖了他们所在那一楼层存在的神的那部分神。将所有楼层合在一起，你就得到一个同时包含所有层级的所有存在的建筑或者实体。这就是我们，你们，神之所是，一个真正无时无处不在的实体，要点就是要让世界上尽可能多的人去质疑并检视他们的环境和范式。

ME: I have to go now. I need to get to work, and I am late. I hope I don't forget this stuff. 

我：现在我得走了，我还要去上班，已经迟到了。但愿我别忘了这些内容。

HSME: You won't. I will make sure that you remember. Let’s go over it again in brief indicating topic headings. 

高我：你不会忘记的，我会确保你记得这些。让我们用简短的主题标题把今天的谈话再重温一遍。

This we did, and it only took a few seconds to get some topic datum so that I could remember. I then went back down the frequencies, again missing a couple of levels at a time until I arrived at the physical levels. 

我们只花了几秒钟的时间就弄好了一个主题大纲，这样我比较容易记住。接着，我降低频率，仍然掠过几个层级，直至回到物质层。

I walked to my car and thought, “I hope I don't forget.” 

我边走向我的车边想，“但愿我别忘了”。

“You won't,” came the reply from a distant place in my mind. My higher self was still in communication with me! 

“你会记得的”，一个声音从我内心深处回答道，原来我的高我仍然和我交流着。

#### The Myriad Shapes and Sizes of Galaxies 

**星系的无数形状与大小**

Another meditation saw me once again soaring up through the levels and landing in the 20th level rather like jumping on the edge of a rather comfortable bed. As I sat there, I saw all the other galaxies in the third dimension and was told by an entity that I could change my view at will. I zoomed in on one of the other galaxies rather than the one I was currently close to. I had no idea which galaxy it was; it looked pretty similar to our own Milky Way, but I was told that it wasn't. I was then advised that I could see the galaxies in another dimension, one where the ambient light was actually white rather than the black of interstellar space. In this dimension there were many different shapes and sizes of galaxies: from flat shapes to totally round shapes to shapes that were like a red ball in the middle with two corkscrew-like tendrils of stars trailing off in an upwards and downward fashion, and others looking like they were just pillars of light. I was told that there are as many sizes and shapes of galaxies as there are stars in the galaxy that Earth inhabits. On this note, I descended down the levels to my 7th level home and went to work. 

在另一次冥想中，我再次飞越过若干层级，停在第20级，就像跳落在一张舒适无比的床的边缘。我坐在那里看到了第三维度的所有其他星系。一个实体告诉我说，我可以任意变换我的视野，于是我放大了其中一个圆点的星系，一个我不认识的星系，它看起来和我们的银河系很像，但我被告知这不是银河系。随后那个实体又提议，让我从另一个维度看这个星系，那里的背景光是白色的，而不是像星际空间的这种黑色。在这个维度中有很多不同形状和大小的星系，从扁平到浑圆的都有，有的像是中间一个红球，有两只分别向上和向下间隙的恒星组成的螺旋状触须，还有的看起来就像是光柱。它还告诉我，这里星系的形状和大小多种多样，就像地球所在的银河系里的恒星一般数不胜数。记下这些后，我回落至第7级的家中，然后就去上班了。

#### The 27th Level - Meeting the Dragon

**第27级：与龙相遇**

The next day I was opening my chakras and realized that I was not totally in my body. I was slightly beside and above myself. I raised my level up to the 20th level, this time going one level at a time. When I reached the 20th level, I felt that I could go further because the 21st level felt easy to penetrate. I pushed harder and established that the next levels up to the 27th level were pretty much the same in response. Moving from one level to another was like pushing my hand through an elastic curtain that suddenly gave way when I pushed past its elastic limit. At this point I realized that I needed to be grounded and quickly sent a line down the levels to the Earth plane and imagined that I had placed an anchor in the ground with the line attached to me. When I completed the grounding work and looked around the 27th level, I noticed that there was another being by my side. The level looked black all around me, and I perceived the being as being black on black and rather dragon-shaped. 

第二天当我开启了脉轮，发现自己并没有全然在自己身体里，而是在身体的侧上方，我把自己提升到第20级。这一次是一次一级的升上去的，当我到达第20级时，我感到还能再前进，因为第21级好像挺容易穿越的，于是我更努力推进，结果确认了直到第27级都像前面的一样能被轻易穿过。从一个层级移动到另一个层级，就像用手去推一个有弹性的屏障，当我将它推过弹力极限时，它就会突然松动让路。这时我意识到我需要做好接地，于是我迅速向下将一条线发送到地球层级，并且想象将一只锚放入地面，通过这根线连接着我。当我完成接地工作后，我环顾第27级，发现还有一个实体在我身边，我在这个层级完全被黑暗包围着。我所感受到的这个实体，就像是黑色底上的黑色实体，外形有点像龙。

D: What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. 

龙：你在这里做什么？你不该在这里的。

ME: Why not? 

我：为什么不能？

D: You are not the right vibration level. 

龙：你的频率与层级不符。

ME: Why is it so black and dark here? I thought that the 27th level was full of light. 

我：为什么这里又黑又暗？我之前一直以为第27级充满了光。

D: It’s black because that is all you can perceive here. 

龙：黑暗是因为你只能在这里感受到这个。

ME: Why are you dragon-shaped? 

我：为什么你看起来像条龙？

D: I am trying to frighten you away, but it obviously didn't work. 

龙：我想要把你吓跑，但显然无效。

ME: I thought everything here was supposed to be good. 

我：我还以为这里的一切都应该是美好的。

D: We are mostly, but you shouldn't be here. 

龙：大部分是的，但你不应该在这里。

ME: If I am not the right vibration level, how did I manage to get here? 

我：如果我与这里的频率不符，那我又怎么能来到这里呢？

D: You just used brute force and pierced the veils between levels. I sense that you are stronger than you could possibly know. 

龙：你是用蛮力穿过了层级之间的屏障，我觉得你比你自以为的要更加强大。

ME: O.K., I must go. I also have things to do on the Earth level (go to work). 

我：好吧，我得走了。我在地球层面还有事情要做（上班）。

#### The Difficulty of Decoupling from Levels Above the 20th Level 

**脱离第20级以上的层级有点难度**

As I descended, I got the impression that it was actually difficult to decouple myself from the levels above the 20th. I felt that I was traveling down a tube with graduations printed on the outside and that the journey down was constrained to being in this tube. I think upon reflection that I had found another shortcut or was allowed to use this shortcut to get me out of the 27th level ASAP. 

我往下降频时，我感觉很难与第20级以上的层级相脱离。我觉得我像是在沿着一根管子往下降落，管子外面印着层级的刻度，而下降的路径被限制在这根管子里。我回想起来以前我曾找到或是被允许使用另一条捷径，让我能尽快离开第27级。

#### The 60th Level - The Necessity of Grounding on the 60th Level

**第60级：接地的必要性**

The next day after the trip to the 27th level, I opened all my chakras and decided to go up to the 27th level again just for a look-see. I shot up the levels and hardly saw the numbers in my mind indicating where I was. I noticed that I was missing numbers and that I was leap-frogging levels. When I got to the 20th level, I kept going and noticed that I had accumulated quite alot of momentum and was literally tearing up the levels as I went—so much in fact that I completely missed the 27th level. I had a mere glimpse of the outline of the dragon on the 27th level as I flew past! Surprised, I saw the 30th, 40th and 50th levels go past me before I finally managed to focus my attention on stopping. I finally stopped on the 60th level and realized that I should send out a line to the Earth plane to ground me. I quickly did this as I envisioning a hook truly embedded in the ground and a rope leading up to me. I wondered how I could have gotten so far when the dragon on the 27th level had told me that I shouldn't have been there. I looked around, and it felt like I was on the outer edge of what looked like a very big onion with all the layers representing the levels I had just traversed. A voice then spoke to me. 

从第27级回来后的第二天，我开启所有脉轮，决定再去27级那里查看查看。我像子弹那样被发射出去，向上飞速穿过一个个层级，几乎来不及看清脑海中指示所在层级的编号。我发现我漏掉了计数，开始蛙跳着穿过这些层级。到了第20级时，我继续前进，此时我发现自己已经积累了一股相当大的冲力，直接冲破了若干能量层级。实际上我冲的太过，已经完全与第27级失之交臂了。当我飞跃第27级时，我只来得及瞥了一眼那条龙的轮廓，我惊呆了。我看到第30、40、50级呼啸而过，直到我终于设法集中注意力停下来时，已经是第60级了。这时我意识到应该向地球层面发送一条线让自己接地，于是我立刻就这么做了。想象有一个钩子牢牢嵌入地面，一根绳子连接着它和我。我很奇怪，那条龙说我甚至不该在第27级的，那我现在是怎么跑到这么高层级的地方来的呢？环顾四周，我感觉自己像是在一个巨大无比的洋葱边缘，它的每一层就代表着我刚刚穿越过的那些层级。这时一个声音对我说话。

#### The Author’s Home Base 

**作者的故乡**

V: You got here because you can. 

声音：你来到这里是因为你可以做到。

ME: How can I get to this level when the dragon entity on the 27th said that I shouldn't be there? 

我：可是我又是怎么来到这一层的？第27级的龙说我都不该在那里。

V: Because you live here, you come from here, and you traverse all these levels all of the time. 

声音：因为你生活在这里，你来自这里，而且你一直在所有层级中穿行。

ME: Who are you? Are you my higher self? 

我：你是谁？是我的高我吗？

V: In a way I am you, and you are me. 

声音：在某种意义上，我是你，你也是我。

ME: So you are not my immediate higher self then. 

我：那么你不是我的直接高我了。

V: No, but we are one in the higher sense. 

声音：不，但在更高意义上我们是一体的。

ME: So are you the entity we refer to as God or the Source Entity? 

我：那么你是我们所说的神或者源实体吗？

V: Yes, you could call Me that. 

声音：是的，你可以那么称呼我。

ME: If this is the 60th level, are there any more levels? 

我：如果这是第60级，那么还有比这更高的层级吗？

V: There are many above and below your current position. 

声音：在你目前位置的上方和下方还有很多层级。

ME: Why did the dragon entity not know that I could traverse to his level and stay there? 

我：为什么那条龙不知道我可以穿越到第27级并且待在那里呢？

V: Because it saw you for what you currently are, an incarnate being in the lowest levels. 

声音：因为他只把你看作是你目前所是，一个在最低频率中的化身实体。

ME: Oh, I see. Can I come here again? 

我：我明白了，那我能再来这里吗？

The next response came to me as I typed this. 

我刚一输入这些内容就得到了以下回答。

V: Yes, but remember where you come from and the work you have to do. Don't get distracted. It's easy to get distracted. 

声音：是的，但是你要记得你来自哪里，有什么使命。不要三心二意的，因为分心是很容易的事。

ME: O.K., I will try not to get distracted. I had best be going now—low level work to do. 

我：好的，我会尽量做到不分心。现在我要离开了，低频世界里还有工作要做。

V: Go in peace. 

声音：去吧，一路平安。

As I descended the levels, I noticed that I was again dropping down the levels in decades rather than in single-level numbers. As I passed the 27th level, the dragon entity noticed me passing and issued a friendly word of advice. 

当我下降时，我注意到我一次跳过了几十级，而不是逐级降落的。在第27级，那条龙发现我正经过那里，就给了我善意的建议。

D: Be careful. Don't get lost! 

龙：当心点，别迷路。

ME: I will. Thank you. 

我：我知道，谢谢你。

I then slowed down as I got to the sub-20 levels and finally stopped as I integrated with my Earthly body. This is one trip I didn’t expect. 

低于第20级时，我开始减速，并在与我肉身融为一体时彻底停了下来。这真是一次意料之外的旅程啊。

#### An Explanation of the Levels - Reasons for the Presence of 100 Levels 

**各层级的说明：存在100个层级的原因**

A morning meditation in August 2003 saw me connected with my hara line. I opened up my chakras and wondered what I was going to receive this time. As my thoughts went to the number of levels and the Source Entity’s comment that there were levels above and below the 60th level, I found myself being told that there are 100 levels. I was a bit suspicious of this as it is too round a number. I then heard the voice of the Source Entity in my mind: 

在2003年8月的一次晨间冥想中，我连接了自己的哈拉线并开启了脉轮，想着这次会接收到什么。当我思索着层级的数字以及源实体曾经说过的话，他说在第60级之上和之下还有很多层级，于是我收到一个信息说一共有100层。我对此有点怀疑，因为这个数字也太整了吧。这时我听到源实体的声音在我脑海中响起。

SE: Why not a hundred? It suits my purpose. 

源实体：为什么不能是100呢？它很符合我的目的。

ME: It's a bit of a round number, that’s all. It would provide suspicion. I am surprised that you can contact me at this level (I was only at the 7th, maximum). 

我：它太整了，仅此而已，会让人怀疑。我没想到在这个层级（当时我最多只是在第7级）你也能与我联系。

SE: I can talk to you at any level. 

源实体：我可以在任何层级与你交谈。

My thoughts went to the 27th level and the dragon entity. 

我的思绪飘到了第27级与那条龙。

SE: That entity no longer has the appearance of a dragon, but he will use it when you need to contact him. It will help you to discern/recognize who it is. 

源实体：那个实体已经不再是龙的外形，但是它会在你需要与他联系时使用龙形，这有助于你辨认它。

ME: O.K. Why did you choose 100 levels? Why not 12 or 96? 

我：原来是这样。那你为什么选择100作为层级数，而不是12或者96呢？

SE: I chose 100 because it gives the individual soul something to strive for. I could have had as many levels as there are souls in the multiverse, but 100 sounded like a nice number. It's also a number which is recognized by most of the incarnate beings in the multiverse. Each level gives an increase in possible knowledge, ability, and understanding. A soul can only progress through the levels by the process of experience gained. 

源实体：因为100能够给予每个灵魂奋进的目标。我们可以把层级数设定的像多维宇宙中的灵魂数那么多，但是100这个数字听起来更好一些，它也是多维宇宙中大多数化身实体能够认可的数字。每一层级都在可能的知识能力和理解上有所扩展。灵魂只有通过所获得的体验过程，才能一级一级的进步。

#### Differences Between Levels 

**层级之间的区别**

ME: So what is the difference in the levels? 

我：那么层级之间有什么区别吗？

SE: They are a distance away from Me. The closer a soul gets to returning to me, the higher up the levels it is able to access or live within. Each level is like the differences in the auric and body levels with the exception that once you have evolved past the need to incarnate in the lowest form (what you are in now) or you no longer need to help out in the physical levels, you move upwards and exist in the higher levels, but you are still subject to the need to evolve to get closer to Me. It's just that the evolution is done on a much finer scale. The difference between the levels that you currently exist in (1 to 7) is quite marked. The difference in the levels above, say in the 50s is much more subtle as you are now focusing your evolutionary attention to specific issues, issues that are really the very fine detail. 

源实体：它们代表着距离我的远近。一个灵魂越是回归、接近我，所能到达或居住的层级就越高。每一层级的区别就像你的辉光层（亦称气场或能量场）与肉体（亦称物质身体）之间的不同。除非你进化到不需要转世于你现在所在的最低形式的化身，或者你不再需要在物质层级中帮助别人，你就会上升而存在于更高层级，但你仍然需要不断进化来接近我，只是那时候的进化会在更精细的范围内进行。你当下所处层级1至7级之间的差异是很明显的，再往上的层级之间，比如在50多级之间差异就细微得多。因为这时你的进化关注点会聚焦于一些特别的问题，一些非常具体而微小的细节问题。

#### Relationship of Levels and Dimension 

**层级与维度的关系**

ME: How does this relate to the need for dimensions? 

我：这与维度有什么关系？为什么还需要维度呢？

SE: Dimensions allow for many things to be done at the same time. To put it another way, it allows the individual part of Me, You, the soul to evolve faster as you are learning and experiencing many things at the same time. Call it parallel processing. 

源实体：维度可以使很多事情在同一时间得以完成。用另一种方式表述就是这可以让我的个体部分，你们，也就是灵魂进化的更快。因为你们可以在同一时间学习和经验，许多事情可以称其为平行处理。

ME: Fascinating, so we really are multidimensional. 

我：太棒了，我们真的是多维度的。

SE: Of course. 

源实体：当然。

#### The Mission of Enlightenment 

**开悟使命**

ME: Is it O.K. for me to put this stuff in a book that I propose to write? 

我：把这些内容放进我将要写的书里可以吗?

SE: Yes, of course. It all helps in the mission to enlighten people. I am not saying it will make you famous or make money, but it will fill in some of the gaps that others have left out. It is important for the whole picture to be made available rather than just parts of the picture. Everyone who is helping to accelerate the evolution of humankind on Earth at the moment is one part of the jigsaw; each is just as important as the other. It's just that some will resonate with more people than others, and, as a result, they will become more popular, making the individual writer more money by default. But they all are important; they all add to the whole. Money is NOT the issue here. 

源实体：当然可以。所有这一切都有助于帮人们觉醒。我说的不是它会给你带来名利，而是说它可以弥补一些其他人未顾及到的空缺。重要的是完成整个蓝图，而不只是此图的一些碎片。每一个此刻帮助地球上的人类加速进化的人都是拼图中的一片，每一片拼图都同等重要。只不过有些人也从大众获得更多共鸣，而这些人也会因此变得更多共鸣，自然也会给该作者带来更多金钱收益。但他们都是重要的，他们都在为整体添砖加瓦。金钱并不是此处的问题所在。

ME: O.K., I have to go now. Can I talk to you on this subject again? 

我：好的，现在我该走了。我还能再跟你讨论这个话题吗?

SE: You can talk to Me at any time. You don't need to rise up to the 20th or 60th level to contact Me; all you need is the intention. 

源实体：你任何时候都可以和我讨论，你不必非要上升到第20级或者第60级来找我，你需要的只是意愿。

#### Back to the 27th Level - The Dragon Entity on Helping Others Awaken 

**回到第27级：龙对帮助他人觉醒的见解**

The following day I connected with the hara energy and opened up my chakras and waited a moment before going up the levels. When I eventually decided to move up the levels, I moved straight to the 20th. I thought this was a bit too fast, so I decided to start from the bottom (7th) and work my way up level by level. I have to admit I was surprised by how fast I went to the 20th. Then I decided to move to the 27th level to visit the dragon entity. When I got there, the entity welcomed me and I gave him my love. He then transformed into the light being I had expected to encounter at this level. He had the appearance of a human figure wearing brilliant white robes. His skin and the robes emitted a brilliant white light. Even though he was now transformed, I will still refer to him as the dragon entity for continuity. 

第二天我连接哈拉能量并打开脉轮，等了片刻才出发去更高层级。当我终于决定要向上升时，直接就向第20级飞去。我觉得这有点太快了，因此我决定从底部（第7级）开始一点点往上升。那么快就上升到第20级，我自己都很惊讶。然后我决定去第27级拜访一下那条龙。到了那里，这位实体很欢迎我，我也表达了对他的爱。接着他变成我预想中会在这个层面见到的那种光之实体，他变成了穿着闪闪发光白袍的人形，他的皮肤和袍子散发出灿烂的白光。虽然他现在变化了样貌，为了表达的延续性，我仍会将他称为龙。

D: The Source Entity is pleased with you. 

龙：源实体对你很满意。

ME: Why is that? I haven't done anything special. 

我：为什么？我并没有做什么特殊的事情呀。

D: He was pleased that you were able to contact Him. There are not many people who have managed to do that. Although all are able to, very, very few do. This is because most people are tied up with living their lives and doing what they need to do to evolve; they are totally engrossed with living on the Earth plane. People who contact Him/It are starting to or have already awakened to who they really are. When they do this, they naturally want others to experience the same wonders they are experiencing and then dedicate themselves to the greater task of enlightening the rest of humanity. Their ultimate aim then is to raise the vibration levels to a point where everyone is enlightened or awake again. They do this by spreading the word as you are with this book and discussing this subject with others who are open-minded enough to also spread the word. 

龙：他对你能够与他连接感到高兴。没有多少人可以成功做到这一点，尽管所有人都有这个能力，但极少人能够真正做到，这是因为多数人忙于生活以及完成进化所需的任务，他们完全被地球层面的生活占据了。那些可以与他接触的人都是开始或已经觉醒意识到自己真正是谁的人。当他们达到时，他们自然也想让其他人体验到他们正在经验的美妙事情，因此他们会投身于帮助其他人类觉醒的伟大使命中，他们的终极目标就是提升频率，使所有人都再次觉醒。他们所用的方式就是像你写这本书那样传播觉醒信息，以及与思想开明能跟他们一起传播的人讨论这些话题。

#### The Great Catastrophe 

**大灾难**

ME: Why would they want to do this? 

我：他们为什么想要这么做呢？

D: It is just the same as anyone who has been involved in an accident or a great catastrophe (such as the great forgetting—that was a huge catastrophe!). The survivors naturally help those who are injured with a view to saving their lives because they would want someone to help them if they were in the same situation. 

龙：这就和一个人遭遇意外事故或者大灾难差不多，幸存者很自然想要帮助那些受害者拯救他们的生命，因为他们也希望自己处于同样境地的时候也有人能伸出援手。

ME: So this is the same for those who either are enlightened or in the process of waking up. They naturally want to help others become the same? 

我：所以那些已经觉醒或者正在觉醒的人也是这样，他们很自然的想让其他人一样觉醒，对吗？

D: Yes, and this is why the Source Entity is pleased with you. He now has someone else helping Him/It to get the other parts of Himself/Itself back to Himself/Itself faster. 

龙：是这样的，这就是源实体对你感到满意的原因，现在又多了一个人帮助他，使他的其他部分能更快回归。

ME: Oh, that’s beautiful. 

我：哦，那太美好了。

D: It certainly is. 

龙：确实。

ME: O.K., I must go now. 

我：好的，我得走了。

I started to go down the levels one by one, and as I did so, I heard the dragon entity call to me. 

我开始一级一级的下降，当我这么做时，我听见龙给我发来的讯息。

D: You can go straight to the level you want, you know. All you need is the intention, but you already know this. 

龙：你知道吗？可以直接去到任何你想去的层级，你只需要有意愿就可以了。你已经知道这点了，不是吗？

I dropped down to the Earth plane thinking, “He's right. I don't need to go through each level. I can just pick a number.” 

我下降到地球思考着，“他说的对，我不用穿过每一层级，只需选好要去的层数就行了”。

#### The Source Entity Identifies the Dragon Entity as Byron 

**叫拜伦的龙**

The next meditation was short but nevertheless interesting. I connected with the hara, opened my chakras, and went directly to the 27th level where the dragon entity being was. Again he was radiating a brilliant white light. I then perceived an iridescent golden light in the shape of a sphere next to him (I will refer to this entity in the masculine as it is easier to have one point of reference). I knew instantly that this was the Source Entity. 

接下来这个冥想不长但很有趣，我连接了哈拉开启了脉轮，直接去到了第27级，也就是龙所在的地方。这次他又是放射耀眼白光的样子，我感觉到他旁边有一个散发着彩虹光芒的金色光球（我将以阳性来指代这个实体，因为有一个参照会比较容易理解）。我立刻明白，那就是源实体。

SE: I am gold because this is what people expect to see. Also, it differentiates Me from the other entities when we are together, and I represent Myself as a similar size to My creations. 

源实体：我之所以是金色，是因为这是人们期望看到的。当然，当我和其他实体在一起时，这色彩使我能够与它们分开，并且我会把自己展现为与我的造物相似的大小。

He appeared to be hovering above and to the right of the dragon entity. 

他在空中盘旋了一下，来到龙的右边。

SE: His name is Byron, and he will help you with your questions. This is a better name than the dragon entity, is it not?

源实体：他叫拜伦，他会解答你的问题。这名字比龙好听，对吗？

ME: Yes. I thought I could contact You personally.

我：对，但我原本以为我可以自己和你联系。

SE: You can. You are contacting Me through him through yourself. We are all connected, and We are all one, are We not? He will be your guide. When you need to speak to Me directly, you will. 

源实体：你可以。你此刻就在通过他通过你自己与我联系，我们都是连接在一起的，我们都是互相连接的，我们本是一体，难道不是吗？他会是你的向导，当你需要与我直接对话的时候，你也可以。

ME: I have to go now. 

我：我得走了。

I was late anyway. 

我已经迟到了。

SE: You always need to go, but even these little sessions are useful. 

源实体：你总说要走，不过这些冥想就算很短也是有益的。

#### Characteristics of the Om Entities 

**OM的特征**

The next meditation I had saw me going straight to the 27th level and seeing Byron immediately in my mind’s eye. I was interested in what Byron did in his level, so I asked him. 

在接下来的冥想中，我直接上升到了第27级，我的意识眼立即看到了拜伦。我对拜伦在这个层级所做的事情很感兴趣，于是我询问了他。

ME: Where do you live in your level? 

我：在你的层级上你住在哪里？

B: On a planet in a solar system in a galaxy in a different universe than you and, of course, in a different dimension. 

拜伦：在另一个宇宙的太阳系的一颗行星上，当然，在另一个维度。

ME: Do you have a physical existence? 

我：你们有物质存在吗？

B: Not in your sense of the word, but things can be considered as physical in the dimension and level that I exist within. 

拜伦：就你所用这个词的本意来说，没有。不过在我所在的维度和层级的语境中也可以这么说。

ME: What do you do on your planet? 

我：在你们的星球上都做些什么？

B: We do things similar to you. We live to evolve and get closer to the Source Entity. We work on a universal level. 

拜伦：我们做的事和你们差不多，我们生存以进化并趋近源实体。我们在宇宙层面工作。

ME: Do you incarnate into bodies? 

我：你们会在肉体中投胎吗？

B: Not in the way that you do. We exist for as long as we want in the form that is necessary for the environment for as long as we need to do our job. 

拜伦：不会用你们这种方式，我们可以根据工作目的以及环境需要在合适的形体内想存在多久都可以。

ME: What is your job? 

我：你们的工作是什么？

B: To evolve and to help the planet evolve and to keep the frequencies high. We all work to keep the frequencies high. Most of what we do is for the whole; we work for the whole to ensure that the whole is able to progress together. 

拜伦：自我进化，帮助星球进化，还有保持高频。我们都为保持高频而工作。我们所做的是大多是为了整体，为了确保整体能够一起进步。

ME: How do you do this? 

我：你们是怎么做的？

I was receiving pictures of people working with the Akashic records. 

我于是收到一些人们使用阿卡西记录工作的画面。

B: We are collective beings; all of us are linked so all work we do is for the good of the whole. 

拜伦：我们是集体实体，我们所有人都连接在一起，所以我们所做的所有工作都是为了整体的利益。

ME: So you are part of a gestalt collective? 

我：那么你们是格式塔集体的一部分喽？

B: We are still individual, but we are one and all. We do not ignore one another or work against each other as your race does for the benefit of the individual. We work for the all; we all want to progress towards the Source Entity at the same time. We get great satisfaction in this goal. 

拜伦：我们依然是个体，但是我们是一体的，也是全体。我们不会像你们的种族那样，为了一己私利而无视对方互相对抗。我们为整体工作，我们都想同时共同向源实体前进。在这个目标中我们获得了巨大的满足。

ME: Can you create things by pure thought? 

我：你们能以纯粹的思想创造事物吗？

B: Of course, one only needs the intention. 

拜伦：当然能，这只需意愿。

#### The Om’s Work with the Akashic Records 

**OM的阿卡西工作**

ME: Do you work with the Akashic records? 

我：你们使用阿卡西记录吗？

B: That is some of the work we do, but this is for the greater whole. We look after histories and knowledge. 

拜伦：这是我们工作的一部分，但这是为了更大的整体，我们守护着历史与知识。

ME: I get the impression that the histories are past, present, and future. 

我：我有种感觉就是历史包括了过去、现在与未来。

B: That is a reasonable assumption for a being that is tied in one dimensional time for most of his consciousness in this incarnation. There is more to it than that because we record the full range of experiences (emotion, pain, joy, love, stress, telepathic communications, etc.) that go with the knowledge. The list of experiences we record is too long to mention here, and again this is only some of the work we do for the greater whole. 

拜伦：对于像你这样的此生大部分意识都被束缚在单一时间维度里的实体来说，这种说法也很合理。我们所记录的远比这个更多，除了知识，还有与之相关的全部体验（情感、痛苦、欢乐、爱、紧张、心灵感应等等）。所记录内容的清单太长了，以至于无法在此一一列举。再次强调，这只是我们为更大的整体所做的一部分工作。

#### The Author as an Om 

**作者也是OM的一员**

ME: Do I always have to meet you at the 27th Level? 

我：我是不是只能来第27级见你？

B: To initiate communication, yes, but once you have linked in and your intention is to communicate with me, you can move around to the other levels and still communicate with me. 

拜伦：发起沟通的时候需要这样。但是，一旦你连接上了，只要你有意愿与我交流，那么即使你四处移动到其他层级，你仍然可以与我沟通。

ME: Why is this? 

我：为什么会这样？

B: You are of the Om, and you are able to move around a number of levels. I think you can go up to the 80th. 

拜伦：因为你是OM的一员，你可以在很多层级之间移动。我觉得你应该可以上升到第80级。

ME: Are we the same type of entity? 

我：我们是同一类型的实体吗？

B: We are similar but not the same. The similarity is insomuch as we are energy-based beings and not of the low density/vibrations and levels needed to become incarnate as you currently are. 

拜伦：我们相似但不同。相似之处在于我们都是基于能量的实体，不同之处是低密度或频率和层级中的实体需要化身，就像你当前的实体。

ME: What do the Om do? 

我：OM都做些什么呢？

#### The Focus of the Om 

**OM的关注点**

B: They do what most highly evolved beings do; they work for the good of the whole with the express goal of returning to the Source Entity. The Om also help the spirits on the Earth plane since this is a pivotal experiment. There are many Om working with the Earth, and you are one of them. 

拜伦：大多数高度进化的实体所做的事情他们都会做，他们为整体利益而工作，带着回归源实体这一明确目标。OM也会协助地球上的灵体，毕竟这是一个关键实验，有很多OM在与地球一起工作，你就是其中之一。

ME: Earth is an experiment? 

我：地球是一个实验吗？

B: Yes. 

拜伦：是的。

ME: What is the experiment? 

我：是什么实验呢？

B: To pave the way for individual free choice rather than collective choice. This is required as it allows faster evolution of the entities involved. It has been interesting to see the progression up and down the frequencies. 

拜伦：为个人自由选择，而非集体选择铺平道路。之所以如此，是因为它使参与其中的实体能进化的更快。观察频率上上下下的波动很是有趣。

ME: I hope I will be able to remember all of this when I finally type it up. 

我：希望当我最后把这些敲进电脑的时候我还会记得。

B: You will always remember, and I will always be with you when you are typing. 

拜伦：你会一直记得的，并且当你打字时，我会一直与你同在。

ME: Thank you. 

我：谢谢你。

I went down the levels to the Earth plane, and as I reached the Earth level, I heard his voice in my head say: 

我向下回到地球层级，我听见他在我脑海里说：

B: Be careful on your motorcycle. 

拜伦：骑摩托车时当心点。

It was a nice day, so I was going to work on my old 1977 Triumph Bonneville. 

那天天气很好，所以我要骑着我的1977年老凯旋摩托去上班。

ME: I will. 

我：我会的。

#### Byron on Intention and Mental Constructs 

**拜伦谈意愿与心智构造**

A week later I went straight to the 27th level, and Byron was there waiting for me. I greeted him. I then perceived that we were standing on a balcony with a steel railing and looking out into space with a couple of planets very, very close by. 

一周后，我直接去了第27级，拜伦正在那儿等我。我向他问好，然后就觉得我们正站在一个带铁栏杆的阳台上望向太空，有一些行星离得非常近。

B: This is an example of what we can do by using a mental construct. 

拜伦：这是我们使用心智构造的一个例子。

The next thing I knew we were looking over a gorge or valley that looked like it could be Earth. 

紧接着，我便发现我们正看着一个像是峡谷的东西，看上去可能就是地球。

ME: This is impressive. How do you do this? 

我：真厉害，你是怎么做到的？

B: We simply have the intention and follow through. 

拜伦：我们只需要启动一个意愿并跟随它。

We were then back in space. Byron had taken me back to the same position with the planets close by. 

我们又回到太空中，拜伦把我带回到刚刚那个靠近行星的位置。

B: This is your solar system. 

拜伦：这是你们的太阳系。

ME: How can the planets be so close to each other? 

我：行星之间怎么会离得那么近？

B: I have brought you to a point in time in your vibration level where they were close together so that you can have a good view. 

拜伦：因为我把你带到了你所在振动层级的一个时间点，此时正好这些行星运行到彼此靠近的位置，这是为了让你可以更好的观看。

ME: Do you use space ships to travel in space? 

我：你们使用太空船做太空旅行吗？

B: Not usually. We generally just go wherever we need to go by using our intention. If we need to come into your vibration levels and travel in physical space, we need to construct a mental barrier to protect ourselves. 

拜伦：不常用，我们通常用意愿去我们需要去的任何地方。如果我们要进入你们的频率层级在物质空间穿行的话，我们就需要建造心智屏障来保护我们自己。

ME: Are these what we call UFO's? 

我：那是我们所说的不明飞行物吗？

B: You have many ways of perceiving them. You see them as golden orbs and even disk-like space ships. You interpret the information in your own ways, depending on what your physical knowledge is and what your mental capacity is for dealing with such information. The object is to show you that you are only limited by your own imagination—an imagination that is limited by your experience of what you believe can be done here on the Earth plane. You could do quite a lot, but you don't fully and unequivocally believe that you can do certain mental tasks and functions, and so, therefore, you fail. 

拜伦：你们有很多种方式感知到他们，你可能会把他们看成是金色的球或者碟状的飞船。你们以自己的方式理解这类信息，用怎样的方式只取决于你们处理这类信息的物理知识和心智能力。我们的目标是向你们传达，唯一会限制你的是你的想象力，而想象力会被你所相信的对于在地球上能做什么的那些经验所限。你完全可以做到更多，但你没有全然坚定的相信你能用心智实现一些任务和功能，所以你就做不成。

#### Byron on Spherical Time 

**拜伦谈球形时间**

Today Byron said as I reached the 27th level, “I am going to tell you about time.” This I thought would be interesting as I believed I was quite adept in the philosophy of how time worked. 

今天当我到达第27级时，拜伦对我说，“我要跟你聊一聊时间”。我想这会是个很有趣的话题，因为我自信相当精通时间运作的哲学。

B: Time is spherical. 

拜伦：时间是球形的。

ME: What? (Out for a golden duck!) How do you mean? 

我：什么？零蛋出局！你什么意思？

B: Time is spherical. All the events in time that have ever happened or will ever happen are happening now or are all happening at the same time. 

拜伦：时间是球形的。时间里的所有事件，无论是已经发生的还是将要发生的，都正在发生，或者它们都在同时发生着。

ME: Can you explain what you mean? 

我：你能解释一下？

B: Basically your perception of time is linear with three points: a past, present and future. You don't perceive an end point, and you can't remember a starting point. However, you do know where you are currently, or so you think, so you perceive the future as in front of you and the past as behind you. 

拜伦：一般来说，你对时间的感知是线性的，它有三个节点，过去、现在和未来。即使你感知不到终点，也无法记得起点，但是你知道自己当下身处何处，或者你以为你知道，即使在你的感知中，未来在你前方，而过去在你身后。

ME: You mean we think of time as in a straight line. 

我：你的意思是说我们把时间想成了一条直线？

B: Yes, but this is not the case. Everything that has already happened and will ever happen is happening all at the same time. Call time a finite series of happenings. If you travel in one direction in the sphere, you will experience the events that are a result of that which has gone before in that direction. But if you change direction . . . 

拜伦：是的，但事实并非如此。一切已经发生或者将要发生的事情，其实都在同时发生着。可以把时间称为有限事件序列。如果你在球体中顺着某个方向行进，你将会经历这个方向上事先发生的事件的结果。但是如果你换一个方向的话...

ME: A whole set of other interactions take place that causes that event to take place? 

我：这样就会发生一系列其他事件，成为那个事件发生的原因？

B: That’s correct. If you travel from event point A to event point D via event points B and C, you know what other events took place to get to point D. However, if you went from event points A to D via B1 and C1, another set of events could have occurred to change the event point D, or not change it, as the case may be. Actually you can also use the term “holographic” to explain the happening of events since the sphere has an interior and not just a surface. 

拜伦：正是。如果你从事件点A到事件点D，途中经过事件点B与C，你就会知道是其他哪些事件的发生使我们到达了D点。然而，如果你从事件点A到D经过的是B1和C1，就会有另外一系列事件发生，而改变了事件点D，或者并没有改变它。正如例子中的情况，实际上你也可以用“全息”这个术语来解释事件的发生，毕竟球体不只有表面，还有内部。

ME: Why is time finite? 

我：为什么时间是有限的？

B: Because the Source decided when our departure would end, and we would all be together with the learning and experiences completed. Hence, the task is finished and the individual concept of events happening is, therefore, no longer necessary and is removed. 

拜伦：因为源头决定了我们的分离何时结束，那时我们将带着所获得的知识和经验重聚一堂。使命既已达成，所谓事件发生的个体概念也就不再必要，因此会被删除。

#### Overlapping/Simultaneous Time and Space 

**重叠同步的时空**

ME: How does this relate to space? 

我：这和空间有什么关系吗？

B: Obviously there is physical space, non-physical space (higher frequency or spiritual), dimensional space, and level space—all happening at the same time. All happening together is a better way of putting it. You can travel to wherever at whatever event point instantaneously and experience what is happening at that event point when you get there. 

拜伦：很显然，存在着物质空间、非物质空间（高频空间或灵性空间）、维度空间，以及层级空间，这一切都是同时发生的。更好的说法，是所有一切是一起发生的，你可以即刻穿越到任何地方的任何事件点，体验那个点在那个时刻正在发生的事情。

ME: How does level space come into it? I thought the levels were relative to the auric bodies. 

我：层级空间又是怎么加进来的？我以为层级是与辉光体有关的概念。

B: They are up to a point, but when you get past the relationship with the physical worlds and you get closer to Me . . . 

拜伦：在一定程度上是的，但当你超越了与物质世界的关联，更接近我时...

#### Levels of Perception 

**感知的层级**

ME: Hang on. Who am I talking to now? (I had noticed the voice change). Am I talking to the Source Entity? 

我：等等，我现在是在和谁说话？（我注意到声音发生了变化）是源实体吗？我这么问道。

SE: Yes. You see, the closer you get to Me, the more like Me you become as an individual, so you go higher up the levels until your bodies are My body. They are anyway, but it will help your conception to consider them as being separate for a moment or two. Essentially, the higher your perceptions of the levels between us, the closer to Me you get. This distance is called the levels of perception or auric body levels at your position in the game. 

源实体：是的，要知道你们距离我越近，作为一个个体的你就越和我相似，你们的层级也因此不断提升，直到你们的身体成为我的身体。当然你们的身体本来就与我是一体，你在观念上把他们一度当做是分离的。本质上你能感知我们之间的层级越高，你就越接近我。这个距离就是感知的层级，或者以你们在游戏中的位置来讲，可以称作辉光层。

ME: And all this is happening at the same time. 

我：而所有这一切都是同时发生的。

SE: Yes. You can perceive or visit any point in time in any level of perception in any dimension in any spiritual frequency you want. If you had the mental capacity (and at this point in time you haven't), you could experience it all at the same point or from all the different points. I refrain from using the word time here, as it is misleading. 

源实体：是的，你可以在任何灵性频率的任何维度的任何感知层级感知或访问时间中的任意一点。如果你有足够的心智能力（在这个时间点你还不具备），你就可以在同一点或者从所有不同的点经验这一切。这里我回避了时间这个词，因为它具有误导性。

My head was spinning as I thanked them both and came down the levels to the Earth plane. This head wasn't big enough. 

我谢过他们两个，回到地球层面，头脑还在不停运转着。感觉脑子真的不够用啊。

#### The Fallacy of the Time Loop 

**时间循环的谬论**

The next day we talked about time again. I was back with Byron. 

第二天我们又谈起了时间，我还是在拜伦那里。

B: Time is not linear as you now know, and because of this, the popular depiction of the time loop doesn't exist. 

拜伦：你现在已经知道时间不是线性的了，正因为如此，流行的时间循环的描述其实并不存在。

ME: What? I thought that this was a well-proven theory. What about the classic grandson killing the grandfather scenario? 

我：什么？我还以为这个理论已经被充分证明了呢。那么经典的孙子杀死祖父的情节又怎么说？

B: Yes, provided that you are in linear time, and you assume that the time line change is such that the grandson’s existence is terminated, but time isn't linear. When you consider that the time line—really a series of events—is changed and the effect is that the grandson is still born but has a different grandfather, then the need to go back in time to kill the grandfather may not exist, and the time line continues. You could also consider that once the grandfather is killed, the grandson stays alive in that time event because that has not changed his personal time line. The series of events after this event, i.e., that his parents were the same, compensate for the change. Everything that has ever happened or will happen is happening now, so the natural thing for the event stream to do is go from the nearest event to the next event that should have happened because it has already happened. 

拜伦：如果你确实处于线性时间中，因此假设时间线改变会导致孙子的生命终结，这种情节是可能的。但时间不是线性的，当你考虑到时间线其实是一系列事件变了，所以孙子依然得以出生，但是他的祖父已经不是原来那个了，那么回到过去杀死祖父的需要也就不存在了，因此时间线会继续下去。你也可以认为，一旦祖父被杀，而孙子在那个时间事件中仍然活着，是因为孙子的个人时间线并没有改变这件事之后的一系列事件，比如他的父母没有改变弥补了这一变化。但是一切已经发生或者将要发生的事情都正在此刻发生。所以对应事件流的最自然的做法是从最近的事件去到下一个应该会发生的事件，毕竟它已经发生了。

ME: Has this something to do with time being spherical or holographic? 

我：这是不是和时间是球形的或者全息的也有关系？

B: Yes, remember that you experience time as a number of events and that each event and all its variations are happening all together. Hence, the individual who traverses the events to affect an individual person in one event switches to another event automatically, one that is similar to but not exactly the same as the one he was just part of. 

拜伦：是的，记住，你将时间体验为一组事件，而每一个事件及其所有不同的变化都是一起发生的。因此，一个人为了影响某个事件中的某人而穿越这组事件时就会自动跳转进另一个事件，一个与此人刚才所处的事件相似但不同的事件。

ME: So this means that the loop theory fails. 

我：这就意味着时间循环的理论是错的。

B: Yes, of course. 

拜伦：那是当然。

ME: This is taking some time to get my head around, even with my interest in temporal concepts. 

我：虽然我对时间方面的概念真的很有兴趣，但我还是需要点时间来消化。

B: It’s bound to. You exist in an environment where it is hammered into you that time is linear.

拜伦：这是必然的，毕竟你所生活的环境让你习惯性的认为时间是线性的。

### Chapter 3 - Byron and the Source Entity 

**第3章：拜伦与源实体**

#### Visits at the 100th Level - Appearance/Forms of The Source Entity and Byron 

**拜访第100级：拜伦与源实体的外貌**

In a later meditation I decided to go to the 60th level bypassing all the other levels on the way up. I then decided to go up to the 100th level. When I arrived, I sensed the Source Entity. The Source Entity visually appeared to be like a galaxy or nebula in a space that was all black. I was positioned on the edge of this nebula. I spoke to the Source. 

在后来的一次冥想中，我决定绕过上行路上的其他层级去第60级，接着我又决定上到第100级。我一到那儿就感觉到了源实体，源始体看起来像一个处于全黑空间中的星系或星云，而我正处于这个星云的边缘。我与源实体交谈。

ME: So this is what you look like. 

我：原来你是这个样子的啊。

SE: Yes. I have no form, but I have form. 

源实体：是的，我无形，但可成形。

Byron suddenly appeared by the side of me, but his appearance was not that of a humanoid. He also looked like a loose ball of energy. 

突然，拜伦出现在我身旁，看起来不像人类。他看起来像是一个由能量构成的松散球体。

SE: This is what Byron really looks like. When he is with Me, he has no need to look as you or any other being that communicates with him would expect him to appear, so he adopts his natural state. 

源实体：这才是拜伦真实的样子。你或其他存有在与拜伦交流时，他会采用你们希望他看起来的样子，会更贴近你们的样貌。但当他与我在一起时则无需如此，所以他就采用原本的样子。

ME: I thought he lived on the 27th level. 

我：我以为他在第27级。

SE: He does, but I brought him here to let you see what he really looks like. 

源实体：他是在那里，我叫他来这里是为了让你看看他真实的样子。

ME: Can only people who access the higher levels, the 60th and above, speak with You? 

我：是不是只有那些能上到更高层级，能上到60级以上的人才能和你对话？

SE: I will speak to anyone on any level if they wish to speak to Me, but generally it is only people who are evolved enough or remember who they are that are able to visit the 60th level and above that manage to contact Me the way you have just done. I use the 60th level as a buffer. 

源实体：我可以和任何层级的任何人对话，只要他们愿意与我交谈。但往往只有充分进化或者能够记得自己是谁的人才能来到第60级或者更高层级，并设法与我联系。就像你所做的这样，我把第60层级看作一个缓冲区。

ME: That’s interesting. I will chat about this some more tomorrow. 

我：这很有趣，明天我想多聊点这些内容。

SE: I will be here. 

源实体：我会恭候。

#### The Source Entity — Time as an Event Stream 

**源实体：时间是事件流**

The next day I decided to go back to the 100th level and talk with the Source Entity again. I went straight there with no need to jump up one level or a series of levels at a time. 

第二天，我决定回到第100级，再次与源实体对话。我没有一级或几级的跳，而是直接去了那里。

SE: Ah, you're back. 

源实体：啊，你回来了。

ME: It's been exactly a day on Earth. How long has it been for you? 

我：在地球上刚好过去了一天，在你这里是多久了？

SE: No time and all time. It is as if you were never away, or you have been gone two years. 

源实体：瞬间或永恒，就好像你从来没有离开过，又或者你已经离开了两年。

ME: Oh, where is Byron? I expected him to be here. 

我：咦，拜伦在哪里？我还以为他也在这里。

SE: He is doing things in his realm. 

源实体：他正在自己的地方。

ME: So did You notice me gone? 

我：那你注意到我离开了吗？

SE: I noticed a lack of attention on your behalf. 

源实体：我注意到你这边有一段注意力的不在。

ME: How do You experience time? 

我：你是如何体验时间呢？

SE: All at the same time and one event at a time. It depends on what I want to focus on; it can be fast or slow. You will also experience time this way when you return to the energy state and to the Source/Myself. 

源实体：可以同时体验所有事情，也可以一次经历一件事，这取决于我关注的是什么。时间可快可慢，当你回到能量状态并且回到源头/我这里时，你也会这样体验时间。

My thoughts went to the comments that the late Adrian Divir made in is his book “X3, Healing Entities and Aliens” about communicating with aliens. He talked about only a week having passed between communications with a particular individual, but the alien he was communicating with said that a year had gone by in his dimension. The Source Entity picked up on my thoughts. 

我想到了已故的阿德里安·德维尔，在他的《X3: Healing, Entities and Aliens》一书中有关于与外星人交流的描述。他说，与某个外星人的交流只间隔了一周的时间，而那个外星人则说在他的维度已经过去了一年。源实体看出了我的想法，接着说。

SE: That is because they are experiencing the event stream (or time as you call it) at a different speed. It is also why they appear to travel and change direction very quickly when they are seen in their craft in your dimension. They are going in and out of their event stream and your event stream to aid their travel in your dimension. The result is that they seem to appear and disappear or move and change direction very fast. The aliens haven't contacted you yet, but they will. 

源实体：这是因为他们以不同速率体验事件流（或者你所称为的时间），这也是为什么从你的维度看身在飞行器中的他们，会觉得他们航行和改变方向都如此快速。为了便于在你们的维度中旅行，他们在自己的事件流与你们的事件流中进进出出，其结果就是他们看起来时隐时现或非常快速的移动和转向。外星人现在还没有联系你，但是他们会联系你的。

As I pondered on this comment, I saw the Source from a distance. It appeared as a vast galaxy of energy in the darkness. I tried to enter its light, and the Source spoke to me. 

当我在思考这些描述时，我从远处看着源实体，它看起来像是黑暗中一个巨大如星系般的能量。我试着进入他的光芒，这时源实体和我说话了。

SE: You can't come in here yet. You are not capable of experiencing the total unconditional love of the Source in your current incarnate form. You will, of course, when you are disincarnate (in between lives) and when you return to Me but not now. It will distract you. 

源实体：你现在还不能进来，你现在的化身还没有能力体验源头完全无条件的爱。当然以后你可以，也就是当你脱离化身但尚未转世前回归我的时候。但现在还不行，这会让你分心。

#### Contact with Aliens 

**接触外星人**

ME: O.K., I understand. What about the aliens? Why have they not contacted me yet? 

我：好的，我明白。那外星人呢，为什么他们还没有与我联系？

SE: They have on the subconscious level, but they find it hard as your mind is too busy. You are truly multidimensional in your mental activity, but you need to allow yourself to focus on one thing at a time. This will allow them access to you. The “Violet Flame” meditation you are doing is helping, but you need to be more resolute. Only when you have quietened your mind will they be able to contact you properly. Also, you try too hard when you start things. You are too intense; this acts as a block. You need to let go and go with the flow. Only then will things happen. You are getting there, but do it slowly and don't try to force it. 

源实体：他们在潜意识层面联系过你，但是感到很困难。因为你的头脑太忙乱了，你的心智活动确实是多维度的，但你需要让自己一次只聚焦在一件事情上，这样他们才能与你连接。你正在进行的“紫焰”冥想很有用，但是你需要更坚定一些，只有当你的头脑安静下来，他们才可能与你接触。还有你做事时太用力也太紧张了，这会造成阻碍。你需要放松，顺其自然，只有这样，事情就会自动发生，你会达成所愿。慢慢来，不要勉强。

ME: Thank you. I will do my best. 

我：谢谢你，我会尽力做到最好。

SE: Don't try your best, just be. Sometimes just “being” is the best thing to do. This is at the heart of meditation. You should try it. 

源实体：无需最好，只需如之所是。有时候顺其自然就是最好的状态，这是冥想的核心所在，你应该尝试一下。

#### Byron on Just Being 

**拜伦谈如之所是地存在**                    

One morning meditation I found myself just being and not trying to contact anyone, such as the Source or Byron. 

一天早上冥想时，我就处在如之所是地存在的状态，发现自己没有试图去连接任何人，比如源头或者拜伦。

B: Just being is sometimes the best thing to do. It slows the mind down. 

拜伦：如之所是地存在有时就是最好的事，它可以放慢你的思维。

ME: Who is that? Is that the Source? Where is Byron? 

我：是谁？是源头吗？拜伦在哪？

B: This is Byron. 

拜伦：我就是拜伦。

ME: Oh, hello. How can you contact me on this level? I am still on the Earth plane. 

我：你好，你怎么会在这里与我联系？我还在地球。

B: I can contact you on any level; it is only you that have decided to come up to my level to communicate, and you think this is the only way. This is no longer necessary. 

拜伦：我可以在任何级与你联系，是你每次到我的层级来与我交流，让你以为这是唯一的方法，但现在不再是了。

Not convinced, I shot up to the 27th level to see Byron. We walked in a lovely wooded glade filled with flowers. 

我不敢相信，于是我又冲到第27级去找拜伦。我们走进一个美丽的林间空地，那里长满了鲜花。

B: Just being is one of the best things you can do. It allows you to just be yourself without the urgencies of the material world. It allows you to think and rationalize and communicate with yourself properly. It will slow YOUR mind down, allowing you to access the spiritual side of yourself, the real you. 

拜伦：如之所是地存在，这是你能做的最好的事情之一。它让你不受物质世界的干扰，只是做你自己。它让你适当的思考，有理性，以及自我交流。它会放慢你的思维，让你进入自己的灵性层面。也就是进入你真正的自我。

ME: How is this? 

我：这是为什么？                                                       

B: Your mind races with a list of things to process; it is constantly planning and scheming on things/jobs that you believe are more important. They appear to be so important that they even override your ability to meditate. This is your conscious mind fighting for supremacy, for it knows that it will eventually lose control of your Earthly existence as you become more spiritual. It wants to perpetuate itself. It will even try to disguise itself by being part of your spiritual agenda and making you think that you need to have your abilities now. In effect, it will make you try too hard and subsequently block your progression—a perfect way to maintain its existence. 

拜伦：你的思维总是忙于一系列要处理的事情，为你认为更重要的事物做计划、定方案。那些事情显得如此重要，甚至压过了你冥想的能力。这是你的潜意识头脑在争夺主导权。因为它知道随着你灵性的增强，它将最终失去对你尘世生命的控制。它想让自己长存，甚至不惜将自己伪装成你灵性的一部分，让你认为自己必须马上就拥有能力。实际上它这样做会让你用力过猛，反而会阻碍你的进步，这就是它维持存在的完美方式。

ME: So just being really is good for you? 

我：对你来说，如之所是地存在真的有那么好吗？

B: Yes, provided you don't focus on it as a means to an end and make it formal. Just enjoy the moments when they appear and don't think that you need to communicate with me or the Source and write something every day. 

拜伦：是的，只要你不把它当作是达到某种目的的手段，也不要正式的看待它。当它们出现时，你只需享受那个时刻。不要想着要与我和源头连接，也不要想着要每天写点什么。

#### Accessing One’s Core Essence/Core Star 

***连接核心本质/星核**

I discussed the just being principle with my wife one night, and I mentioned the information I received about it being an essential part of getting in contact with our core essence. I also talked about the feeling that I had been getting that the material world was feeling more and more like an illusion. I said that I thought “The Matrix” movie was a very important concept for people to think about in terms of understanding the difference between the realities of the spiritual world compared to the great illusion of the material world. We also discussed the need to access levels individually when we are in contact with our core star. We considered that when we are in contact with our core essence, we will be operating on all levels at the same time and will not, therefore, need to think about going to a level to communicate with an entity or being. This also came up in my morning meditation the next day. 

一天晚上，我与妻子讨论如之所是地存在。我说起我所接收的信息是与我们核心本质保持连接的一个必须的部分。我还谈到了我的感觉，物质世界越来越像是一个幻相。我说我觉得电影《黑客帝国》提出了一个发人深省的重要概念，有助于人们理解灵性世界的实相与物质世界的巨大幻觉之间的不同。我们还讨论了当我们与自己的星核相连时，是否还需要单独连接那些能量层级。我们都认为当与自己的核心本质相连，我们就同时在所有层级上了，因此不需要考虑去某个层级与某个存有之间的沟通问题。第二天早上冥想时，这个问题又冒了出来。

SE/B: Just being is a key part of getting in contact with your core essence. 

源实体/拜伦：如之所是地存在，是与你的核心本质保持连接的关键一步。

ME: Who am I speaking to? The Source or Byron? 

我：谁在和我说话？是源实体还是拜伦？

SE/B: Both of us and one of us, for we are one and the same. You understand this on a deeper level. 

源实体/拜伦：是我们俩，也是我们中的一个，因为我们是一体的，是同一个。你对这点理解的更深了。

ME: I am getting the feeling that I no longer need to “go” to a level to communicate with you. 

我：我有种感觉就是我不再需要专门“去”某个层级与你们交流了。

SE/B: That is correct, for when you are in contact with your core essence, you are truly everywhere and at all levels at the same time. You just are. You don't need to go to the 127th level to contact Me. 

源实体/拜伦：的确如此，因为当你与你的核心本质连接时，你确实无处不在，同时处于所有层级，你就是存在着，你无需去127级找我。

ME: Hang on. I thought there were just 100 levels. 

我：等等，我以为只有100级。

SE/B: There are only 100; it was a figure of speech. However, an individual may want to split the levels up so that he/she is able to take the evolutionary level jump at an easier pace. 

源实体/拜伦：只有100级这只是一种说法。不过一个人可能会想分级，这样他就能更为轻松的实现进化阶段的跃升。

ME: O.K. You were talking about the core essence. 

我：好吧，你刚才说到核心本质。

SE/B: Yes, the core essence is the real you. It is your essence in the fullest sense of the word. The core star can be considered as a database of all your experience and existence—all that you have done, will do, and are doing. Once you access this, you will fully understand and believe that the material world really is the great illusion. You will understand that you are energy and that you can manipulate energy. In being able to realize and fully believe this, it will become your ultimate reality. You will realize that you can manipulate energy in the material world, as well as affect the material world reality. A master knows and fully understands and believes this, for he is who he really is. This is how a master can do things, like dematerialization, teleportation, and telekinesis, etc.—all the things that will get the attention of the people in the material world, the so-called hard evidence of a higher order of things. A master can do this because his belief is unequivocal. He is himself incarnate in the material world together with all the knowledge, understanding, and experience of the universe and God, for he is one with God and the universe, and the universe and God are one with him. 

源实体/拜伦：是的，核心本质就是你的本我。这是你的本质这个词最完整的理解，星核可以被视为你所有经验与行为的数据库，一切你做过的，即将做的以及正在做的一切。一旦你连接上它，你就会完全理解，并坚信物质世界真的只是一个巨大的幻相。你会明白你是能量，你可以操纵能量。当你能够意识到并完全相信这一点时，他就会成为你的终极实相。你将会发现自己能在物质世界中操控能量，并且可以影响物质世界的现实。大师就是知道并完全理解和相信这一点的人，因为他就是本我。这就是为什么一个大师可以做到诸如使物质消失、瞬间移动、心灵感应等事情的原因。这些事情都会引起物质世界里人们的注意，是证明事物的更高秩序的所谓铁证。大师之所以能做到这一点，是因为他内心确信，他带着关于宇宙和神的所有知识、理解以及经验，化身在物质世界中，因为他与神和宇宙是一体的，宇宙和神与他合一了。

ME: Thank you. That is both beautiful and interesting. 

我：谢谢你，这很美妙，也很有趣。

SE/B: Of course, it is the nature of everything. All is in balance when understanding is finally achieved, and belief is replaced by knowing. Getting in contact with your core star/core essence allows you to get in contact with the real you. It allows you to access who you really are. 

源实体/拜伦：当然，这是一切事物的本性，当你有了透彻的理解，用理解取代了相信，那么一切都是平衡的。与你的星核或核心本质连接，可以让你接触到你的本我，它让你进入你真正的自己。

#### Removing the Veil of Separation from Our Real Self 

**移除分离的帷幕**

ME: But what happens if we remove the veil that separates us from our real self and what we think is reality? Would this not cause mayhem? People would think that all that they have strived for is to no avail. They would realize that there is life after death and that everything is love and light and that this real reality is infinite. Then they’d come to the conclusion that if everything is love and light, then why not have a good time while they are here on Earth. They would abandon the need to strive and work for the evolution and experiences that they came to Earth to experience in the first place. 

我：但是，如果拿掉隔离本我与我们所认知实相之间的面纱，这会有什么后果? 这不会造成混乱吗？人们会认为努力不过是徒劳，他们会意识到死后还有生命，一切都是爱与光明，实相是无限的。接着他们会得出这样的结论，如果一切都是光和爱，那么为什么不在地球享受生活呢？他们会放弃努力，忘记进化及体验最初转世地球时想要体验的事。

SE/B: That is correct, and that is why a few, and only a few, individuals are able to access both worlds: reality and the material world at the same time. This is because they understand that they are here for a reason and that they must also commit themselves to finish what they started, as well as work with the spirit realms. To do this, they need to be grounded and be able to balance the two worlds of the reality and material. 

源实体/拜伦：对，这就是为什么少数人，只有少数人能够同时进入实相世界和物质世界的原因。因为他们明白，到地球来是有原因的，必须致力于完成他们已经开始的事情，以及致力于灵性领域的工作。要做到这一点，他们需要脚踏实地，并能够平衡实相和物质两个世界。

My thoughts went to the Chinese dynasties of the past. 

我的思想跳到了中国古代的那些王朝。

SE/B: Yes, that is right. They realized that they were going to reincarnate and that life and their real selves were perpetual. Once they had established this, they decided that it was best to have jam today rather than tomorrow, so they abandoned the need to complete their Earthly experiences and delayed evolution until their next incarnation. They chose to have a life of decadence instead. The result was that this belief was perpetuated beyond the normal life and death cycle associated with reincarnation, and they didn't evolve for several lifetimes. In fact, they incurred quite a lot of karma which has taken some of them many lives to work out. Some are still catching up. 

源实体/拜伦：是的，没错，一旦他们知道会再次转世，生命与本我是永恒的，他们就会及时享乐，放弃了今世要在世俗间完成的体验，而将进化推迟到下一次。他们会选择颓废生活，而结果就是人们的这种信念已超越世俗生活及生死轮回的状态，一直延续着，导致他们很多世也难以进化。实际上,这还招致了很多业力，多次轮回也难以清理，有些人仍然陷入其中。

ME: So you really do have to be special to work with the spirit worlds within the material. 

我：所以，要在这个物质世界里正确地对待灵性世界，你必须要有一些不同的想法。

SE/B: Yes, you need to be quite a way up the evolutionary scale and be dedicated to both causes you have taken responsibility for. 

是的，你既需要保持一定的进化速度，也要同时认真对待你来到人世间所负有的责任。

#### The Role of the Aliens 

**外星人的角色**

One Tuesday I opened my chakras and wondered what the subject for today would be. As I thought about discussing aliens, I sensed a presence in my consciousness. 

在一个星期二，我开启了脉轮，畅想着今天的主题是什么？当我想到外星人的时候，我感觉到意识里有一个临在。

ME: Who is there? Byron? The Source? 

我：谁在那儿？是拜伦吗？还是源头？

SE/B: The Source, Byron, both of us, as we are one as we are one with you. 

源实体/拜伦：既是源头也是拜伦，是我们两个。因为当我们与你一起时，我们是一个。

At this time I wasn't concerned with what levels I was on as I now knew that communication was independent of which level I was on. All I needed was the intention and the belief. 

这次我并不关心所处的是哪一级，因为我知道无论处于哪一级都不会影响交流，需要的只是意愿与信念。

ME: What do aliens have to do in the scheme of things? 

我：外星人在这个计划中要做什么？

SE/B: They are a part of the bigger picture. They work for the good of the All. Of course, some of them are as ignorant as humans and, therefore, only work towards their own ends. But mainly many of them are highly evolved and are doing everything they can do to support their own evolution and the evolution of others and the universe. They are dedicated to increasing the vibration levels of the universe to bring it back to what it used to be during the time after the separation of My/our self. Humans are part of this because, as you know, independent free will is the great experiment that will allow the universe to evolve faster. 

源实体/拜伦：他们是更大蓝图的一部分，他们为了全体利益而工作。当然，他们中的一些人也会与人类一样的无知，仅仅是为了自己的目的而活着。当然，他们中的大部分已经是高度进化了的，并且在尽其所能支持他们自身、他人，乃至整个宇宙的进化，他们致力于提高宇宙的频率，使其返回自我分离前的那个状态。人类是其中的一部分，因为你知道独立的自由意志是这个伟大实验，它让宇宙进化的更快。

#### Byron on the author as an Om 

**拜伦谈作者是OM的一员**

This communication ended as fast as it started, but I was to talk further on the subject the next day with Byron on his own time but with a difference. I was still on the Earth level, but I was talking to Byron via what I visualized as a tube or bypass between the 27th level and the Earth level (level 1). 

交流很快结束，但我在接下来的一天，在拜伦闲暇的时候，就同一个话题进行了更多的交流。我依然在地球层级，但是我能通过构想一个第27级与地球层级（第1级）之间的管道或旁路来与拜伦对话。

ME: Hi Byron, I am still on the Earth level. How can I talk to you? Are you on the Earth level? 

我：拜伦，我还在地球上，我怎么能说与你对话呢？你在地球上吗？

B: No, I am still on the 27th level but am communicating to you through a bypass that you have created. 

拜伦：我不在地球，我依旧在27级，我正通过你建立的管道与你交谈。

ME: Oh, how did I do that? 

我：哦，我是怎么做到的？

B: I don't know, but it works. 

拜伦：不清楚，但确实可以用。

A bit confused as to how I created a bypass without knowing how or even that I had created it, I continued with my intended dialogue. 

有些困惑，我不知道是怎么创建的这个通道，我甚至不知道已经创建了它。我继续我们之间的谈话。

ME: I wanted to talk next about aliens and how I fit in. 

我：接下来我们谈谈外星人以及我要如何适应。

B: O.K., but I will start with a statement of reality first. You are part of a race of beings called the Om. You are a race of light beings that travel the universe visiting different galaxies. 

拜伦：好的，但首先我要陈述一个事实，你是OM种族的一部分，你属于一个光之存有，是一个种族，这个种族在宇宙中穿梭拜访不同的星系。

ME: How did I get involved in being here on Earth? 

我：我是如何来到地球上的？

B: You were made aware of the work that was going on in the Earth plane and understood how important it was and that it was pivotal to the evolution of the universe. In realizing this, you undertook sacred work under the guidance of the Source Entity to help the occupants of Earth remember the knowledge, the truth. 

拜伦：你知道了地球上正在进行的工作，知道了它的重要性，它是宇宙演化的关键。当意识到这一点时，你在源实体的指导下，从事了这份神圣的工作，帮助地球人回忆起知识真理。

ME: It doesn't seem to have worked very well. 

我：看起来效果并不好。

B: It has but not in the way you wanted it to. You expected there to be centers of excellence for retaining the knowledge and the truth. This happened, but it was abused by the Egyptians and other notable races that used it to control others. Over a number of lifetimes, you have been able to assist in keeping this knowledge and truth alive in the minds of a few dedicated and aware (awake) individuals, Masters, and believers in the truth. 

拜伦：有效果，但不是你想要的那样。你期望世界上有些卓越的中心来保留知识和真理，也确实有过，但被埃及人和其他知名的种族滥用来控制他人。在你的几次人生中，你已经帮助将这知识和真理保存于少数献身于觉知觉醒的个人、大师，以及信仰真理者的意识当中。

ME: So where are we now? 

我：那么我们现在在哪里？

B: You and the Om have assisted in getting the Earth back to the condition where knowledge and truth are becoming known and believed by more and more people. We are now at a point where we almost have the critical mass necessary to allow us to raise the frequency of the Earth back up to the levels that it should be. You have reincarnated into a very important time period. The Om are a race of light beings that are one with God. All beings are, of course, one with God, but the Om are higher up the frequencies. When you took on-board the most sacred and important work on Earth, you made a special and massive commitment that has lasted many lifetimes. 

拜伦：你和OM已经帮助地球回到这样一个阶段，知识和真理被越来越多的人所熟知和相信。我们现在正处在一个关键点，几乎已经到达临界点，使地球频率提升，回到它过去应有的水平。你转世到了一个非常重要的时期。OM是一种光之存有的种族，与神一体。当然，所有存有都是与神一体的，但OM的频率更高。一旦你从事了地球上最神圣最重要的工作，你就许下了一个特殊伟大的承诺，持续很多世。

ME: So what is my work in this lifetime if the critical mass is almost achieved? 

我：如果临界点即将到来，那么我在这一世的工作是什么呢？

B: You are to help in the realization process. This is showing the general public the things concerning spirituality that they can relate to and measure. You will show them that this is but just a small part of spiritual matters and that although there is a more physical side to spirituality, this is just for demonstration—to get their attention. Once you have their attention, you will be able to tell and teach them about the reality and truth, the big picture. You will need to be pure of mind, body, and soul, so you had better start cleansing yourself. 

拜伦：你将帮助实现这个过程，你的工作正向公众展示与他们有关以及他们可以理解的灵性事物。你将会告诉他们，这只是灵性世界的一小部分，即使灵性也有更靠近物质的一个方面，这只是为了引起他们的注意。一旦吸引了他们的注意，你就能告诉并教授他们更大层面的实相、真理、大景象，你的心智、身体，与灵魂需要纯净。因此，你最好开始着手清理净化自己。

#### Byron Introduces Hum 

**拜伦介绍Hum**

The next morning I was grounding myself and opening my chakras when I got the impression that Byron was close to me with there was another entity by his side. He was wearing a silver suit that appeared to have no seams but gave the appearance of a space age pullover type garment. I increased my frequency to that of the 27th level and greeted Byron. 

第二天早上我开启脉轮，这时我感到拜伦正在靠近我，并且拜伦身边还有一个实体。他穿着似乎无缝的银色套装，看起来像太空时代的套装，我将频率提升到27级迎接拜伦。

B: Hello, this is *******. 

拜伦：你好，我是...

I couldn't pronounce his name. 

我不会他名字的发音。

B: You probably can't pronounce his name, so we will call him Hum. 

拜伦：你可能不会他名字的发音，那么我们称他Hum好了。

ME: O.K. Why is Hum here? 

我：好的，Hum为什么在这里？

B: He is beloved of the Om, as are you, and he will be able to help you in all your questions about alien races in the universe/s. He will also help you communicate with them so that you can further your knowledge. 

拜伦：他和你一样，也为OM所爱，他将为你解答本宇宙或所有宇宙中有关外星种族的所有问题。他也会帮助你和外星人交流，这样你就能进一步了解他们。

ME: Why does he wear the silver suit? 

我：为什么他穿着银色的套装？

B: That is so you can discriminate me from him. He will help you with the other races. 

拜伦：这是为了你能将我们两个区分开来，他会在其他种族问题上助你一臂之力。

ME: I have to go now. 

我：我要离开了。

B: That is O.K. The objective was to introduce you to Hum, and this has been done. 

拜伦：也好，目的是向你介绍Hum，这已经完成了。

ME: Thank you both. 

我：谢谢你们。

#### Byron on Oneness with Our Higher Self 

**拜伦谈与高我合一**

My first morning meditation after coming back to the UK from Crete saw me literally shooting up to the 27th level to see Byron. When I arrived, I felt that I was distanced from myself and was bouncing around like I was on a trampoline. 

从克里特岛回到英国后的第一次晨间冥想中，我像子弹一样窜上27级去见拜伦。当我到达的时候，我觉得我已经远离了我自己，并像在蹦床上一样蹦蹦跳跳。

B: Your movement up to my level was too fast for your conscious mind to keep up with. That is why you feel at a distance to yourself and see yourself bouncing around. 

拜伦：你来我这级的运动速度太快了，你的潜意识头脑无法跟上这样的速度，这就是你感觉距离自己很遥远，像是在弹跳的原因。

ME: This is interesting. 

我：这很有趣。

B: Yes it is. It is one of the ways in which you can contact your higher and true self. You can do this by moving up the frequencies too fast and literally leaving your conscious mind behind. Your conscious mind usually stops you from doing this by making you think of other things, such as those small jobs around the house or garden that you end up doing. You can use this method to get in contact with your higher and true self, which will allow you to operate more in your higher self's consciousness than your physical mind’s consciousness. 

拜伦：是的，很有趣。这是你与高我和本我接触的方式之一。你可以通过在频率中快速移动，将潜意识头脑丢在后面，通常你的头脑会通过让你想其他事阻止你这么做。比如让你惦记在房子或花园周围做的那些即将收尾的小工作，你可以用这个方法与高我和本我接触，这将使你能够在比物质头脑意识更高层面的高我意识中运作。

ME: I have a question based upon the duality of the two minds. On page 259 of Adrian Divirs' book X3, Healing Entities and Aliens, the author mentions that the physical mind and the higher self mind operate in parallel. The higher self mind has a copy of all that’s experienced and recorded by the physical mind and adds it to the larger memories and past life knowings of the higher self and Spirit. When the physical body dies, the physical memories die, and the memories that were recorded by the higher self mind are retained. I find it really disturbing that the person that I currently am appears to really die and that what is retained is just a copy. (My mind went to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s film The 6th Day where people were having their memories preserved and transferred to a clone.) This appeared to give the individual immortality until a clone was released before the original was dead, which illustrated the fact that they were really two people with two memories and not one memory being transferred from one body to another. 

我：我有个关于两种意识二元性的问题要问。在阿德里安·德维尔的《X3: Healing, Entities and Aliens》一书的第259页，作者提到了物质界意识和高我意识是平行运作的。高我意识储存了所有物质意识的经验和记录，并将其加入到高我及灵体的多世记忆当中。当肉体死亡时，物质世界的记忆就会消失，高我记忆则会保留。我觉得令人很不安的是，目前的我也许已经死了，留下来的只是一个备份而已。（我的脑海中出现了阿诺德·施瓦辛格的电影《第六日》，电影中，人们把他们的记忆保存下来，并将其转移到一个克隆人身上。）这似乎是一种永生之法，直到出现在原个体死亡之前，克隆人就被释放来到世间。这种情况说明，实际上是两个人带着两套记忆，而不是一套记忆从一个人转移到另外一个人身上。

B: Yes, that is mostly true and is correct for the general population of incarnate entities who are never aware of their higher selves. However, when you are truly in contact with your higher self, you are in total control of who you really are and tend to focus your attention more and more within your higher self's consciousness. You are totally able to access all your previous lives’ memories and information accumulated in your higher self's mind. When this happens, you see the human body for what it is—a vehicle for evolution and not who you really are. Because your attention is now in the higher self rather than the physical self, you experience yourself as your higher self. Your attention is shifted from one part of you to another, the real you. The only problem here is that the individual must try to stay grounded when in this state; otherwise, he/she will appear to become distant (or spaced out) from the physical body. Then it will lose control of it. When your attention is focused on the higher self, you will not experience the feeling and fear of this kind of mental duality. You will be able to move your consciousness freely between the physical and higher self, effectively creating one mind, one set of new cumulative higher self and physical memories and thus perpetuating a feeling of oneness. The greater picture is that once you can do this, you will be able to interface and integrate with the other parts of yourself that are either incarnate or in spirit experiencing the total oneness of your true, true self as a multidimensional being experiencing many things and many incarnations on many planets and many dimensions all at the same time. 

拜伦：是的，对于那些从没觉知道高我的轮回转世的普通大众来说，这多半是正确的。但是当你真正与高我连接，你会完全掌控你自己，并且会将注意力集中转向内在的高我意识，你完全可以知道所有前世记忆以及高我积累的信息。这时你会这样看待人类身体，它是进化的工具，而不是你真正的身份。因为现在你的注意力是在高我，而不是物质自我。你是作为高我在经验自己，你的注意力就从你的一部分转移到另一部分，那个真实的你。唯一的问题是，在这种状态下，个人必须努力保持接地，否则它将会远离，脱离物质身体，会失去对肉体的控制。当你的注意力集中在高我时，你将不会经历此类二元性导致的情绪和恐惧，你将能够在肉体和高我之间自由地切换你的意识，并且可以有效的创造一种意识，一套新的高我和物质界记忆积累，从而产生永存合一的感觉。一旦你能做到这一点，你能与自己的其他部分互动与整合。你的这些部分要么也处于化身状态，要么是灵的状态，体验着与你本我的合一。本我就是这样一个多维存有，他同时存在于很多星球，很多维度，同时经验着很多事情，有很多化身。

ME: Wow! Thanks a lot. Now I understand. 

我：哇，太感谢了。现在我懂了。

B: Not bad for a six minute meditation, but, of course, time is different when meditating. And don’t forget that concepts, knowledge, and understanding are transmitted in more than the spoken or written word. 

拜伦：对于六分钟的冥想来说已经不错了，但冥想中的时间是不同的，不要忘了概念知识与理解的传递，不仅仅是所说或所写文字的语言形式。

#### Byron on Accessing Higher Self Memories 

**拜伦谈及连接高我记忆**

The next day I again went to see Byron on the 27th level and decided to prove the comments he made about moving too fast through the frequency levels. I moved through the levels bouncing around from the 27th to the 15th to the 30th to the 50th to the 100th and down again. I moved so fast that I (my physical mind) was starting to lose sight of my higher self’s mind. I moved from galaxy to galaxy in the blink of an eye. 

第二天我又去了27级找拜伦，并决定验证一下他所说的在频率层级间飞速移动的问题，我从27级弹跳到15级，再到30级，再到50级，再到100级。我移动地如此之快，以至于我的肉体意识开始无法看到我的高我，一眨眼的功夫，我就从一个星系移动到了另一个星系。

B: You’re losing me, too. I can't keep up with you! 

拜伦：你移动地太快了，我跟不上你了。

I then moved back up to the 100th level where I saw another galaxy form. This I recognized as the Source Entity. He/She/It spoke to me. 

然后我又回到了100级，在那里，我看到了另一个星系形体，我觉得这是源实体。他和我说话。

SE: Remember who you are! 

源实体：回忆起你是谁！

I then experienced something totally unexpected. I received impressions of many, many, many lives being lived. I gained glimpses and impressions of pictures and feelings of where I was and where I had been. I was a Byzantine warrior, a Roman, an Egyptian. I saw an aircraft go over my head in Atlantis, I saw structures of buildings on another planet, and I met up with the Om and embraced them. 

接着我经历了一些完全出乎意料的事情，我接收到了许多、许多、许多次前世影像。我浏览了很多照片和影像，在这些照片中，我感受到我曾在哪里，又曾去过哪里？我曾做过拜占庭武士，做过罗马人，做过埃及人，在亚特兰蒂斯，我看到一架飞机飞过头顶，我看到了另一个星球上的建筑结构，我遇见了OM并拥抱了他。

I received the impression that there was far too much for my physical consciousness to comprehend so only fleeting impressions were received and interpreted. Mere snapshots of what was being given to me were grabbed by my physical consciousness and relayed to me. As I write this, I feel that I have been given a gift. When I de-focused my attention from my physical mind to my higher self-mind via core star meditations or simply moved too fast through the frequency levels for my physical consciousness to keep up, I effectively diffused the concentration of physical consciousness to the more diffuse requirement of the spiritual or higher self-consciousness. In effect, I raised my vibration level and expanded my consciousness to encompass the wider corners of self by expanding the horizon of my awareness through diffusion of concentration. In eyesight terms, it would be like fully using your peripheral vision. I was told that this technique would allow me to focus on my higher self’s consciousness to access my higher self’s memories. 

我接收到一种感觉，那就是我的肉体意识理解不了这么多，所以只接收和解读出一些飞快闪过的影像，我的肉体意识仅能捕捉到很少的一部分内容，接着再转达给我。当写下这些时，我感觉收到了一份礼物。为了让我的肉体意识跟上，我通过星核冥想或者仅是在频率层级间快速穿越，把我的注意力从肉体意识转移到高我意识中。这样的话，我就有效的扩散了肉体意识的凝聚度，将其用于灵性或高我意识中。实际上，通过扩散我的专注力，我扩大了意识的边界线，这让我提升了频率级别，也扩大了我的觉知，意识到更广阔的自我。换作视力来说，它就像是完全使用了你的边缘视力。我被告知说，这个技术能使我专注于高我意识，从而进入高我记忆系统。

#### The Om on Concentration, Focus, and Meditation 

**OM谈专注、聚焦与冥想**

My morning meditation was proving to be difficult with my mind wandering onto more Earthly pursuits. After I finally managed to calm my mind down, I projected myself up to the 20th level again and looked around. The gap between the 20th and 21st was narrow, so I expanded it so that it was more comfortable. I saw the usual black/grey appearance of this level and then decided that I would expand my awareness to what the real appearance of the 20th level was. It instantly went into a bright white light and at the same time two of the Om came to greet me. They were pleased that I had been able to see what the real 20th level environment looked like. In contrast they looked like wispy black entities, but I perceived that this was only in comparison to the very, very iridescent bright light of the 20th. They told me that this light was pure celestial light. They then said they would give me a lesson in concentration. I thought this was very appropriate. 

这个晨间冥想有些困难，因为我的头脑不停地在地球生活的琐事中游荡。但最后我终于使自己平静下来，接着我再次投射到20级，并环顾四周。20级与21级之间的间隙非常狭窄，为了更舒服，我就把它扩展了一下，我看到这一级呈现出常见的黑灰色。接着我决定将觉知扩展到整个20级，以便看到它真实的样子。我瞬间进入一束明亮白光之中，这时两个OM过来向我问好，他们很高兴我能够看到20级真实的模样。相比起来，他们看起来像微黑的实体，但我觉察到这仅仅是与20级非常明亮的彩虹光相比他们才偏黑。他们告诉我，这个光是纯净的天光。接着他们说会教我一个集中注意力的训练，我想这正合适。

I suddenly found myself on a tight rope (without stabilizers) crossing a canyon in the US with the knowledge that I had to concentrate 100% on the task at hand or risk losing my life. I felt the level of concentration as being total engrossment. I was one with the wire I was walking on and knew exactly where to place my feet and how to distribute my weight. There was nothing else in the universe that mattered; I wasn't even interested in the wonderful view or the birds that flew by me. I was totally focused on the task at hand. 

我突然发现自己走在一根绷紧的绳子上，手中没有平衡杆，正在穿过美国的一个峡谷。我知道必须100%专注于当前任务，否则就有性命之危。我感到自己全神贯注，我与脚下的绳子合为一体，完全知道脚要放哪里，以及如何分配自己的体重。宇宙中再没有更重要的事了，我甚至对那美妙的景色或飞过的鸟儿都不感兴趣，我完全专注于当下的事。

Afterwards, I returned to the 7th Earth plane levels. What an excellent example of concentration and focus! This experience helped me tremendously to understand this concept. 

随后我回到了地球第7级，这真是一个专心与专注的好经历，这个经历极大地帮助了我来理解这个概念。

The next day I started my meditation and closed all of the doors off on the downwards spiral staircase that represented my thoughts. Each door represented a different thought and, therefore, a different distraction. I opened up all my chakras and rose up to the 20th level pulling up some friends (who I assumed were some of the Om, who were on the 14th level) at the same time. They then re-emphasized the previous day's lesson on concentration. They stipulated that the tightrope walker was an excellent example of pure 100% concentration. The level of concentration was such that nothing outside of doing the task at hand was important. A tightrope walker needs to dedicate those minutes of his life purely to walking the rope. He/she cannot allow any outside influences to intrude or distract his concentration. 

第二天我开始冥想，关闭了下行旋梯的每一扇门。它们代表着我不同的思绪，是一种注意力的分散。我开启了所有的脉轮升到20级，同时拉上了一些朋友，我觉得他们是在14层级的OM，他们再次强调了前一天关于凝聚注意力的训练，他们确定走钢丝是极佳的例子。可以训练百分百集中注意力，他专注程度如此之高，以至于除了正在做的事情，其他都不重要。走钢丝的人需要把他人生的这几分钟时间完完全全贯注在绳子上，他不能允许外界任何的影响，干扰他的注意力。

This is the level of concentration that is necessary when meditating. 

这就是冥想时所需要的意识的专注程度。

Om: You must be dedicated enough to allow the short period of time to be used in the meditation process and nothing else. 

OM：你必须足够专注，使这短短的一段时间只用于冥想，没有其他杂念。

I then had a fleeting thought about looking at my watch to find out what time it was since I had to go to work soon. The Om picked up on this instantly and said that this is exactly what they were talking about. Even this minute distraction was enough to cause a downward spiral of lack of concentration. 

我突然想看一下时间，因为不久就要回去工作了，这马上就被OM发现了，并说这正是他们要说的，即使是一刹那的分神也足以引起注意力的螺旋式下降。

Om: The ten or so minutes of meditation should be considered sacred, and no other thoughts should be allowed to interfere with it. The distractions are only the conscious mind’s desire to take control again. It feels that when you are accessing the higher self-mind, it is somehow losing control and is frightened that it somehow may not get it back. 

OM：十分钟左右的冥想应该被认为是神圣的，不要让杂念干扰，注意力的分散就是大脑想要再次掌控。当你连接高我时，大脑在某种程度上感觉失去了控制，并且害怕可能再也无法收回控制权。

#### The Source Entity on Preparing for Meditation

**源实体谈冥想准备**

SE: A number of different ways can be used to still the mind as a prelude to meditation. One is to count the heart beats; the other is to concentrate on the breathing rhythm. A further method is to imagine you are stroking a favorite animal or throwing a ball for a dog. All of these focus the mind on one thing only. You could also think of a big yellow ball above your head and then imagine your spirit rising up to join with it. This also works. 

源实体：有许多不同的方法，可以用于冥想前平息头脑。一种是数心跳，另一种是专注于呼吸节奏，还有一种是想象你正在抚摸一只喜爱的动物或者和狗抛球，所有这些都会将思想集中于一件事。你也可以想象一个大大的黄色球在你的头顶上方，想象你的灵体上升，直到它他合一。这些都可以。

Concentration can also be considered a vital part of meditation, and, even classed as meditation in its own right. When you meditate, you need to focus on the meditation and not the idle chatter of your mind that wants to continue to control you and prevent you from accessing your real self. Only when you are fully focused can you meditate properly; focusing requires you to concentrate on the meditation process and only that. Give yourself a little mental note to know when your meditation/concentration is wandering and drag yourself back into focus. Concentrating on something simple is the best route. 

专注，也被认为是冥想的关键部分，甚至你可以认为专注就是冥想。当你冥想时，你需要集中于冥想，而不是那些扰乱你大脑的杂音。因为那些杂音想继续控制你，并且阻止你接近本我。只有全神贯注才是正确的冥想。专注要求你集中注意，且只集中于冥想过程。为自己设计一个心理便条，以便知道在冥想，专注中何时注意力分散并重新回到专注中。把注意力集中在简单的事情上是个好方法。

#### Celestial Light 

**天光**

With this lesson well and truly learned, I commented on the bright light that was the 20th level, and the Om again said this was celestial light. It was not the same as the celestial love experienced on the 6th level. It was the light of all things and nothing, all places and no place, all universes and no particular universe, all times and no time, all dimensions/frequencies and no dimensions/frequencies, all beings in all times, dimensions, frequencies, and universes all at the same time. This is what made the light so bright; everything and everyone was burning so very brightly. I then saw some bright spots that moved around, and I was told that these were other beings that were specifically aligned with the 20th level. That's why they were brighter than the ambient light. My fellow beings looked dark in lieu of all this brilliant ambient light. On the Earth plane they would look like brilliant white/golden light, but here they looked dull in comparison. I wanted to embrace them all and thank them for the lesson and their patience in teaching me. I felt them smile, and I sensed that it really was time to hit the road and go to work. 

这一课我收获颇多，我提到了在20级碰到的亮光。OM再次说那是天光，它与我在6级经历的天体之爱不同。这光源自万物与无物，遍处与空处，一切宇宙与个别宇宙，永恒时间与无时间，变维度/频率与无维度/频率，同一时刻所有宇宙维度、频率及宇宙的所有存有，这就是这光如此明亮的原因。所有的东西都在燃烧着，如此明亮。我看到了一些四处移动的亮点，我听说这些亮点是其他一些20级的特定存有，这就是为什么他们比背景光更亮的原因。与这些明亮的背景光相比，我的同伴们看起来相对较暗。在地球上，他们看起来应该会发出白色金色的亮光。但相比之下，在这里，他们则很暗色。我想要拥抱他们，感谢他们给我上的这一课，以及他们在教导我时的耐心。我感到了他们在微笑，但也真的是时候去上班了。

#### Mixed Remembrance of Memories and Abilities 

**记忆与能力的混合追忆**

At my next mediation I was more focused and determined not to be distracted. I opened up my first seven chakras to associate myself with the auric levels and then swooped up to the higher levels. When I arrived at the 14th level, I noticed the tube (bypass) that I had put in place to allow the Om to pass up to the 20th level. Upon my arrival, I felt the presence of another being who I assumed was one of the Om. 

在这次冥想中我更专注，下决心不再分心。我开启了前七个脉轮，将自己与辉光层相连接，接着又升到更高的层级。当我到达14级时，我看到之前安装的管道（或者旁路），这个管道是让OM去20级时使用的，我一到达就感到另一个存有的存在，感觉像是OM的一员。

Om: We are impressed with your ingenuity; you are remembering. 

OM：我对你的创意印象深刻，你正在回忆起更多的东西。

ME: Thank you. I am starting to remember stuff but not remember it in the way that I want to. 

我：谢谢你，我开始回忆起一些东西，但却不是以我自发意愿的方式。

Om: Define. 

OM：讲一下吧。

ME: Well, I just know that I can do things, such as constructing the link between the 14th and 20th levels, but I can't remember past lives or the places/planets/galaxies/ dimensions where I used to live or even my previous time with the Om. 

我：好的，我知道可以做一些的事情，比如在14级与20层级之间建立联系。但是我不记得过去的生活，或者我曾经住过的地方/行星/星系/维度，甚至记不起以前和OM一起的日子。

Om: It is interesting that you mention the time before. You really must be next to a computer when you are meditating so that you can write our discourse straight away, but if you can’t, we will make sure that you can remember what we say to you. 

OM：你提到以前的时间，这很有趣。当你在冥想的时候，你应该在一台电脑旁边冥想，这样你能直接把我们的对话写下来。但是如果你没在电脑边，我们会确保你能记得对话内容。

ME: How will you do that? 

我：你怎么做到呢？

Om: We will program you with a long term memory function so that you can download what was communicated to you. 

OM：我们将为你编程一个长期记忆功能，以便你可以下载我们与你交流的内容。

This dialogue was typed a few hours after the meditation. The conversation flowed back from my mind and into the keyboard. It felt like I was having total recall! 

这段对话是在冥想的几个小时后打出来的，谈话内容从我的脑海中自然浮现来到键盘，我感觉自己好像处于全身心回忆状态中。

#### The Om on an Image of Om as a Ball of Light

**OM谈光球的形象**

I then decided that I wanted to see the celestial light of the 20th level and that I wanted to see the image of the Om. 

接着，我决定去看看20级的天光和OM的形象。

ME: Oh, you look almost human (angelic) to me. 

我：哦，对我来说，你看起来几乎是天使般的人类一样。

Om: That is because this is all your mind is able to cope with in its existing incarnate form. 

OM：这是在你现有转世形体内你的头脑所能感受到的。

ME: Can I see what you are? 

我：我能看看你是什么样子吗？

Om: Yes, but you will only see us as something you can translate into your current limited understanding, but, you will SEE later. 

OM：能，但你只会看到当前你有限的理解力所能解读的形象，不过，你随后会看到的。

ME: I see you as a ball of light energy. 

我：我看到你是一个光能量球。

Om: Yes, this is a good example and one that your mind can use as a translation substitute for something that it can't directly place into a recognizable context. You need some form of reference point, a datum from which to work. If you don't have the experience in this incarnation of what an energy being looks like, your brain will use a substitute, one that you can understand as meaning “This is an energy being.” 

OM：是的，这是一个很好的例子，是你的大脑解读它不能识别的东西时的一个替代物。你需要某种形式的参照物，一个基准。如果你此次转世中对能量存有的外形没有经验，你的大脑将使用一个替代物，以让你理解“这是一种能量存有”。

#### Seeing an Energy Being 

**看到一个能量存有**

ME: Oh, do I have to see an energy being, or do I only need to sense or communicate with one? 

我：哦，我是否需要看到一个能量存有，或者我只需要感觉它，或与其交流呢？

Om: There are energy beings that you will not be able to see because the energy is not visible. It is too refined, too fine to be picked up even with spiritual eyes. You don't really need to see them anyway for you will know their presence and be able to communicate with them, albeit in a limited way. 

OM：有些能量存有你是看不到的，因为它是不可见的。它太精微了，即使用灵眼也不能识别。其实你并不需要去看他们，因为你会知道他们的临在，并且能够与他们交流，虽然是以受限的方式。

ME: Thank you. I must go now. 

我：谢谢你，我得走了。

During these meditations and subsequent recalls, especially when I am typing up the text that forms the dialogue, I am constantly thinking that I am deluding myself, that I am only talking to myself. But it is the speed and subject matter of the information that comes through that tells me that this is more than just talking to myself. Also, some of the information is said in such a way that it is foreign to me. It is then that I know this is not the Earthly me speaking.

在这些冥想和随后的回忆中，尤其是当我在输入这些已经形成对话的文字时，我一直在想，我在欺骗自己，我只是在自说自话，但记录这些信息的速度和内容主题又说明我不仅仅是与自己谈话，而且有些信息对我来说是陌生的。那时我知道这不是我正在地球上自言自语。

#### The Source Entity on Intuition and Common Sense 

**源实体谈直觉与常识**

ME:I have had a number of occurrences over the years when the correct answer to a question has popped into my head before I have had chance to work out the answer by logic and calculation. 

我：多年来，有很多这样情况发生，我的脑海中会突然跳出一个问题的正确答案，我甚至来不及通过逻辑和计算得出答案。

SE:Yes,I have seen you do this.You must learn to trust intuition and use it as much as possible.When you use this faculty often enough,it will become second nature to you and will lead you to instant communication with the higher self.Intuition is the higher self's way of giving you internal guidance. It is the way that the higher self(the larger part of you that is still in the energetic)tries to train you to start using the information that is not available by logic or from your Earth experience/s but from your higher self.It makes you trust your feelings by putting you into a situation where the intuitive information is correct,and this was only apparent when you have arrived at the same conclusion by Earthly logic.Hence,you learn to trust your intuition as you see more and more evidence that the information given is both correct and accurate. 

源实体：是的，我见过你这样做，你要学会相信直觉并尽可能的使用它。当你经常使用这种能力时，它将成为你的第二天性，并将引导你与高我进行及时沟通。直觉是高我给予你内在指导的途径，它是高我能量层面更大部分的自己试图训练你使用信息的一种方式。这种信息来自高我，而非来自逻辑头脑或人类经验。通过把你放置于一个情况中，同你通过人类逻辑也得出与直觉信息同样结论的时候，你才能发现直觉是正确的，这样你就会更相信你的感觉。因此，当你看到越来越多的证据表明直觉所提供信息的正确和准确，你就学会相信自己的直觉。

Using one's common sense is similar. 

这和个人常识的使用类似。

When people say "Why don't you use your common sense?"they don't actually know what they are say- ing.The common sense is actually all the total learning and experience of all incarnate spirits in the universe, a true reservoir of knowledge.Thus,when people use their common sense,they intuitively tap into the wealth of knowledge that is available to them via the universe.For example,when individuals use their common sense for servicing their car,they might not actually have the knowledge and experience themselves,but they are able to do the work when they intuitively tap into universal knowledge.They might not actually need to have experience of the learning themselves but can benefit from the learning of others.This is also true of an evolved and aware spirit who may need the knowledge of a great inventor or leader of people but doesn't have the time or need to go through a whole life to gain the experience or knowledge to help him address a certain life issue. 

当人们说，“你为什么不使用常识？”他们实际上并不知道在说什么。常识实际上是宇宙中所有转世灵体的全部所学和经验，常识是一个真正的知识库。因此，当人们使用常识时，他们会本能的连接宇宙中可用的知识财富。例如，当人们使用常识修车时，实际上他们可能并没有修车相关方面的知识和经验，但是他们能够用直觉接入宇宙知识库就能完成工作。他们不必学习，但可以从别人的学习中获益。当一个进化的有觉知的灵体需要伟大发明家或领导者的经验与知识，但没有时间去经历整个人生来获得这些经验或知识时，也可以这样获取知识，解决某个生活问题。

Common sense can also apply to recently gained knowledge,i.e.,what a spirit learns two minutes ago, could be used as common sense by another at the same time or two minutes later. 

常识也可以适用于刚刚获得的知识。比如两分钟前一个灵体学到的东西，在同一时间或两分钟后可以被另一灵体用作常识。

#### The Source Entity on the Twelve Source Entities 

**源实体谈12个源实体**

The next day I was again outside the universe and talking to the Source Entity,one of twelve entities that were split off from another larger entity,the Origin.Of course,the objective of Their creation is to find out as much about Themselves and the universe as possible and report back to the Origin for Its and Their collective learning and knowledge. 

第二天，我又来到宇宙之外与源实体进行交谈。它是由另一个更大的存有（起源）分离出来的12个存有之一。当然，他们创造的目标是尽可能多地了解自己和宇宙，并向绝对起源反馈个体与集体所学。

ME:So how many of You are there? 

我：你们一共有多少个？

SE:There are twelve of Us. 

源实体：我们有12个源实体。

ME:And your purpose is to learn. 

我：你们的目的是学习吗？

SE:Yes,this is the purpose of all beings given individuality from the Origin. 

源实体：是的，这是所有由起源赋予了个体性的存有的共同目的。

ME:So what are the others doing? 

我：那么其他源实体做什么呢？

SE:They are doing the same as Me and you,trying to find out about Themselves and give the collective knowledge to the Whole,so that the Whole can progress. 

源实体：他们和你我一样努力去发现自己，将收集的知识反馈给整体，这样整体就可以进步。

ME:So how are the others doing this? 

我：那么其他源实体是怎么做的呢？

SE:Each of Us has decided upon a different route of evolution.I have chosen to split into two with one side of Me being whole and the other being many billions of souls in a number of universes in a finite (but nevertheless infinite to you)number of dimensions.Each has its own individuality and collectivity.Another has decided to be one and contemplate the reasons for self on Its own.Another has split Itself into four,whereas another has split Itself into a billion souls totally,etc. 

源实体：我们每个都有不同的进化路线。我选择了分裂成两部分，一部分是整体，另一部分成为有限的（但对你来说是无限的）维度中的宇宙中的无数灵魂。每个源始体都有自己的个性和共性。而其中另外一个源实体决定保持整体性，并独自思考自身的原由。另一个分裂成4份，也有一个分裂成11个灵魂，等等。

ME:So why are there only twelve of you? 

我：那么为什么只有12个呢？

SE:Why not? That is the number of entities the Origin decided to split off from Itself. 

源实体：为什么不呢？这就是起源将自己分裂成实体的数量。

ME:The number twelve seems significant!Weren't there twelve apostles and twelve ascended masters and even a council of twelve? 

我：12这个数看起来意义重大！不是有12使徒，12扬升大师，甚至12长老议会吗？

SE:Yes,and this is all due to the other Sources visiting My area of responsibility,including Myself.Each ascended master was a Source Entity trying to learn outside Its own area of responsibility.You will also find that there are only twelve dimensions used in My universe although in reality they are infinitely finite(finite but infinite to you). 

源实体：是的，这一切都是来源于参观我负责区域的其他源头，包括我自己。每一位扬升大师都是一个到自己负责的领域范围之外去学习的源实体。你也会发现，在我的宇宙中只使用了12个维度，尽管在现实中它们是无限之有限的。（它有限，但对你来说是无限的）

ME:So when do you expect the learning to finish and You twelve return to the Origin? 

我：那么什么时候你们12个结束学习返回起源呢？

SE:Who knows?There is no plan.

源实体：谁知道呢？还没有计划。



## Part 2 - The History of God

**第二部分：神的历史**

### Chapter 4 - The History of God

**第4章：神的历史**

#### Meeting the Origin 

**会见起源**

During a morning meditation,I found myself asking the question about whether or not the material I was taking down as a result of countless meditations was worth publishing.Bearing in mind that many others had already written these sort of books,and they num- bered in the thousands,I felt that another book of the same genre would not make enough impact to progress this "good"work to another level of awareness/discus- sion.I,therefore,needed direction on which way to go. 

I had previously found that I could explore different levels of consciousness up to and past 100 levels.Each level was a frequency level equal to that experienced by healers who have the ability to sense the seven frequency levels of the human aura(based on current popular understanding).After some thought on this,I found myself focusing on the frequency that led me to the Source Entity(an energy being that I had previously been in contact with during a number of meditations and subsequent channeling opportunities)and zoomed up past the 100th level to talk to Him/Her/It. 

ME:I want some direction on what I should be writing about for my book. 

SE:You should write about the history of God. 

ME:What?! 

SE:This has not been done yet since most people who are in contact are actually in contact with Me and not the Origin. 

#### Who Is the Origin?

ME:Who is the Origin? 

SE:The Origin is the entity that I am part of;it is the one that we twelve are split away from to under- stand what I/We are. 

ME:I have not been in contact with the Origin yet? 

SE:You have but only fleetingly. 

ME:Should I be speaking with It/Him/Her? 

SE:Yes,it is the best place to begin. 

I then called the Origin in my mind hoping that he would speak to me.At this time I found myself outside the multiverse controlled by the Source Entity I associ- ated with as God and looked further afield.In the dis- tance I saw a coalescence of light. 

ME:Origin,can I speak to you? 

O:You may. 

ME:Where are you? 

O:Everywhere and nowhere. 

ME:I want to know about the history of you. 

O:Do you have the time and patience? 

ME:I think so. 

O:Then I will begin. 

I chuckled to myself.This all sounded a bit "story teller- ish”tome..

### Chapter 5 In the Beginning 

#### The Origin on Creating Greater Awareness of Self Via the Twelve 

O:In the beginning I was not aware that I was aware and just existed.You can consider this by just "being"and listening to everything that is going on around you without making any judgements about anything or trying to work out what is going on.At some point over the millennia,I decided that I was aware of wanting to know more about what was going on around and in Me. 

ME:Were there any other lifeforms around then? 

O:Where there is energy,there is eventually conscious- ness and there is life,but consciousness is not true life until it is aware.There was lots of life at what you would call the "vegetable level of conscious- ness,"but this to Me was only like the cells that are in your body.You know they are there,but you can't communicate with them since they don't yet have that level of awareness,and neither do you.As I fur- ther reflected on this need for awareness,I decided that I would split Myself into thirteen,one being Me and the other twelve being other smaller parts of Me that had individual consciousness and aware- ness,plus an inherent need to search and learn about consciousness and awareness.How They did this was up to Them,but They were charged with returning to me with an answer of some kind. 

ME:So You became aware and wanted to know more? 

O:Yes,that's right.The task for the other twelve parts of Me was to find out more about the environment that was Me.

ME:Are there others like You?I only sense You. 

O:That is because you are within Me now. 

ME:There must be an end to the number of times I can go up to see other higher beings,and You must be it be- cause I can't imagine any more than Your level. 

O:That is because of your limited point of view. 

ME:Are there more?Is there a higher level? 

I tried to look further and suddenly found myself in another environment where there were more Origins. This was freaky,and I was feeling very spaced out. 

#### A Starting Point Where EverythingJust Is 

ME:There has to be an end somewhere? 

O:Yes,there is,but you will not accept it when it hap- pens because your brain considers that there must be something bigger.How can I explain that there has to be a start,a point where everything just is until it becomes aware? 

ME:I have real difficulty with this.Ifeel like my brain is about to explode under the strain. 

O:I can see 

ME:So if there are many entities that are controlling the multiverses to learn about what awareness means and to experience different things,how can They call them- selves God when a person like me or some other person says they are in contact with God? 

O:That is because we are all part of the total.If you call the total a name and that name is "God,"then We are all God.We know We are God because We are in contact with the total and Ourselves all at the same time.We don't know any different because We are not"cut-off"from God like you are;therefore,We call ourselves God because that is who We are.We are all one entity;We are all God.

#### The Origin Looks Within Self 

Me:So how did You become aware and decide that You wanted to know more about Yourself? 

O:When I became aware that I was,I decided to look into Myself and see what I was.I was surprised to see that I was many things. 

ME:How did You do this?It must have been a massive task? 

O:It was...Consider yourself as the sea and imagine the wonder that I had when I found out that the equivalent of fish and crustaceans were also part of Me. 

I then found myself looking into me,looking at the very heart of myself.Suddenly I felt as if I was floating in space and looking at things as small as cells and bac- teria and wondering at the diversity of life within me that I had no prior realization about on the personal experience level. 

O:Yes,that's it,except that what I saw was different types of energy in different densities and different frequencies,and some were only present on certain dimensional levels.Some of them spread across many dimensions and changed in their appearance when they were present in different dimensions. All of them behaved differently,depending on the dimension they were in or how many they were linked to. 

ME:So did they also have awareness? 

O:No,but some parts were developing rudimentary consciousness,which is the first step towards awareness.The task was so big that it literally took millennia to go through every part of My "different levels."To move around within Myself,I would focus my attention,and I would be there instanta- neously traveling within Myself and able to create within Myself anything that I wanted without barriers or limitations. 

#### The Origin as the End 

I then suddenly saw the truth.The Origin was the end, and everything was taking place within the Origin.All of the other twelve "Source entities"were split off from the Origin but were still contained within the Origin. They even appeared to pass around the outer edge of the Origin.This is where I was getting confused and muddled up.I could see the others and their own exper- iments happening in front of me,and around me was the environment that was the Origin. 

O:It was fantastic to see different parts of me doing things that I had absolutely no knowledge about. Eventually I got to the point that I needed to dig deeper and deeper within Myself to see what was going on.As I was doing this,I noticed the lower dimensions or frequencies and realized it was pos- sible to have different frequency levels in a single dimension. 

ME:You mean dimensions within dimensions? 

O:Yes,I noticed that at some level I was much slower and had difficulty in accessing the rest of Myself. 

#### The Origin Breaks Off Twelve Parts of Itself 

ME:Would this be the physical levels? 

O:Yes,and others like it.It was at this point that I thought it would be interesting to discover how I would react if I was in a position where I was totally cut off from Myself.This I did for a certain indiscernible amount of time but discovered that I actually didn't learn much since I didn't have a task to do.I then decided that I would create the others and give these other parts of Me the opportunity to do the same but with both of Us observing and learning/experiencing what was occurring.Your level is the lowest and most difficult and most fruit- ful in terms of the learning experience.

ME:So what made you decide upon the number 12 as the number of different parts of yourself to split off? 

O:This was based upon distinction in the different levels of the dimensions within Me.I noticed that there was a specific difference,and that this was in twelve parts.So when I decided that I wanted to know more about Myself,I decided it would be a good idea to have parts of Me focus its attention on each one of these twelve dimensional zones. As I delved further into Myself,I also noticed that these twelve zones were also divided by twelve with each zone being separated by twelve dimensional octaves with each octave being a group of three dimensions. 

Me:Wouldn't you be better calling it a tritave? 

O:Possibly,but I decided that octave sounded better and could be more easily understood by you in your current level of incarnation and ability to access the common knowledge base whilst using your con- scious mind. 

#### The 12 x 12 x 12 x 3 Different Dimensional Levels 

ME:So in effect you have 12 x 12 x 12 x 3 different dimen- sional levels.That is 5,184 dimensions. 

O:Yes,and each is divisible by the major dimension or an octave.This is why the numbers 12,4 and 3 are important.12 a dozen (a baker's dozen 13,the 12 plus 1 Me!)the twelve disciples and 1-Jesus- Me!3 days for the spirit to totally leave a dead body, 4 octaves to a dimension(the three physical planes in your case,plus 1 "time")Also,you can make any number you like out of the manipulation of the numbers 4,3,and 1. 

I tried it,and He/She/It was right.You could make any number. 

ME:What about different frequency levels?

O:The dimensions and the frequencies are,in effect, the same thing;however,one is separate whereas the other is together. 

ME:Can you explain? 

O:With a frequency change,the matter(spiritual or physical)is further apart from its lower frequency self;whereas,with a higher dimensional level,the matter(spiritual or physical)is in the same place as its lower dimensional part.A dimension is,there- fore,overlaid by time rather than frequency,which is separated by a molecule's speed and the space it occupies. 

I tried to see how this would look,and my head started to hurt with the stretching of my mental boundaries. 

O:You are trying too hard.Try to think of it in these terms.Each of the twelve Mes was assigned to work within a certain range of dimensions;these were split into twelve levels.There are twelve more levels separating the levels between each of these levels, and these were split again by 3 to bring the struc- ture down to the lowest dimensional or frequency level.Three of these together create a workable environment that I call an "octave."You humans happen to live in the bottom three frequencies that make up the first dimensional level in a particular Source Entity's area of evolutionary responsibility. 

ME:How does this relate to the existence of different universes? 

O:As previously stated,each Source created as many universes as He/She/It needed to gain experience and evolve.Simplistically,within each dimensional level there can exist a totally separate universe with each equally important and addressing the issue of evolution in a different manner.Each is independent of the other but equally dependent and interlinked with one another. 

ME:So this linking is why it is possible to travel through other dimensions or use other dimensions for traveling instantaneously in our dimension? 

O:Yes,as I said before,you have to have a back door. 

ME:So why did You allow all of the Source Entities to split the dimensions into the octave parts? 

O:To allow Me to experience everything about Myself right down to the quark level,as you would put it, and below.I felt the need to do this when I found that parts of Me lost contact when they were at the lower levels.This is what you experience as humans incarnate and are projected into the very lowest levels.You start to lose contact with the rest of your higher selves and develop individual consciousness and even limited awareness that is separate from the rest of yourselves.Your higher self was,of course,aware of what was being ex- perienced at the lower levels,but that part of you that is actually in these lower levels loses the ability to communicate because of the limitations that present themselves in these lower frequencies.It is like a worm that is cut in two but is still connected by its skin.The worm develops as two separate worms and eventually becomes two,but you don't because that skin that holds you together,the aura never withers and dies.The information accrued in the physical is in both zones,so when the physical dies,the information contained in the "physical consciousness"is still maintained in the spiritual consciousness,and your attention is presented back to the spirit rather than the physical.This is the reason why you should not be afraid of dying in the physical because your projected consciousness is withdrawn and not lost,unlike the worm's body that eventually becomes separated from the origi- nal when the skin withers and dies. 

#### The Origin on the Purpose for Humanity's Incarnating 

I decided to ask the main reasons for our incarnations.

ME:What is the main reason for us being here on Earth? 

O:To experience and learn from those experiences and in the process evolve whilst contributing to the whole. 

ME:What do I have to do? 

O:You have to do a number of things,and the fact that your discussions with me are limited to small amounts of time means that you are experiencing many things,which is good. 

ME:So what is one of things that I have to learn? 

O:What is your pleasure? 

ME:What? 

O:What is your pleasure?You need to experience pleasure and joy.This is one of the things that you really haven't grasped yet.Sometimes it is best to just sit back,be,enjoy the fruits of your hard work and feel the pleasure and joy that comes with relax- ation.Try to ensure that you aren't too engrossed in striving for more or trying to be better because as a result you are never happy with what you have. 

ME:I can relate to that.I think I know exactly what you mean. 

O:Do you?You are still not grasping the nettle [See Glossary for clarification]! 

#### The Twelve Sources - Varied Approaches to Learning 

ME:So the twelve Sources have different approaches to the way They learn about Themselves and Their environ- ment,YOU. 

O:That's correct;the Source Entity that you are work- ing with decided to duplicate the way that I split Myself up into twelve.

ME:Is that why we have 12 x 12 x 12 x 3 dimensions? 

O:Yes,that's right.If you look at one of the other Source Entities structures,you will find that They are 12 x 4 x 12 x 3 with the multiplication by 4 that comes from the number of times They have divided Them- selves,i.e.,the number of universes that They have decided to use as the medium that They are using to work out all about Themselves. 

ME:Looking at the number of universes created by my Source Entity and the position that we humans are working in,I would say that we are right at the bottom of the universe,dimension,andfrequency pile. 

O:Yes,you are,but that is where you score the most evolutionary points,so to speak.As I have said before,you,or at least part of you,is totally cut off from the rest of yourself,so you have to do an awful lot without your higher functions.It's a bit like what I explained before;it's your equivalent of having no eyes,ears,touch,smell,or taste and still trying to build the Eiffel Tower. 

ME:It's an almost impossible task. 

O:That's right,but somehow all of you manage to succeed. 

#### The Origin on The Author's Writing about the History of God 

ME:How do you want me to tell the world about the history of God? 

O:That is entirely up to you.You can write it as twelve or thirteen books with each book dealing with the works of each of the Source Entities and,of course, Me.Or you can write one book with thirteen chap- ters,each with a summarized version of the story of each Source and Me.This would give you and your audience a taste of what is to come and give them an appetite for buying other books.

ME:But which one should I write first? 

O:You could write about Me and the Source Entity that looks after your universes first.This will be the most popular.The other books will only be popular with those people who want to know the truth about the rest of Me,but people will read them.I can hear your thoughts now.No,they don't need to be massive novels.Just write enough to make people feel that they are getting value for money and big enough for you to convey what you need to convey. 

#### The Origin on Its Sphere of Twelve and the Termination of Our Universe - The Source Entity as Independent and Yet Integral with The Origin 

My mind suddenly saw the rest of the Source Entities, and then I just as suddenly zoomed into the memory of the Source Entity that looks after the universes that the Earth plane is within.I suddenly had the feeling of joy and awe associated with realizing that a part of it now had focused consciousness;it was independent but still integral with the Origin.It was a strange over- whelming feeling that came over me.One that was all encompassing.

I looked back again at the Origin and saw that the con- figuration of the different Source Entities was not as I had previously seen them:as individual spheres within the sphere of the Origin.They looked like the sphere of the Origin that had been segmented into twelve. 

Me:Why has this changed? 

O:Because you are now able to understand what hap- pened to a greater depth.Look at your own Source Entity;it is a direct copy of My own division. 

I looked at the Source Entity that we refer to as God and saw that this was true.Each of Its twelve divisions was also layered into the twelve dimensions.They ap- peared like the individual veins of a set of retractable blinds,each one signifying another plane of existence, another dimensional level.Each one occupied the same space and time but did not interfere with the other. Each plane of existence split into the three levels that allowed the 3rd dimensional world approach that we are aware of with each three levels together representing a single dimensional octave in Origin space.It was beautiful. 

ME:I have been thinking about the universe and the popular belief that there will be an end to the universe. What can you tell me about that? 

O:Well,the answer to the question that there might be an end to your universe is the choice of the Source Entity who created your universe. 

#### The End of Earth's Universe 

ME:Do you think It would end the universe? 

O:That would depend upon the circumstances of what It's trying to achieve.Remember,I created the Source Entities to help Me explore Myself and to know more about Myself on all levels.The Source Entities created Their own versions of Me in order to duplicate the effort behind the exercise of knowing Myself.They had free will in how They chose to achieve it.If that means that They disassemble the environments that They have created,then that is up to Them. 

ME:Why would They disassemble the environments They have created? 

O:That is a question that you would need to answer by asking all of Them yourself.In essence,They would only disassemble the environment They have con- structed if it had finished the job it was constructed to do,if it was not meeting its objectives (and, therefore,needed to be modified in some way),or if a complete change of direction was required to make the exploration process more efficient. 

ME:What would happen to the other entities like me, for instance,if the Source Entity that controls our universe decided It had either completed Its job or It was so far off track that It needed to be broken up and started again? 

O:You are part of It.All of you are,just as all of Them are part of Me.Once you are given sentience,you are considered separate.A return to the Source Entity is not something that is enforced upon a sentient being.It is something that the being ei- ther strives to achieve or believes that it is happy in its singularity.Everything is down to free will. However,once you return to the Source,you are not stuck there.You can break away and experience whatever you want to experience on your own at any time.You do not lose your individuality by becoming part of the whole again.In essence,you never really had your own singularity because you are always part of something bigger,the Source Entity/Me,but by the Source Entity allowing you to have your own energy system,you achieve complete singularity by association with a local nucleus.This nucleus is the singularity which allows the energy that is you to stay together.It is in a similar way that the universe is held together. So you become your own entity whilst being part of a bigger entity.Together with this is the ability to group together to solve problems or experience different things,as well as return to your creator, the Source Entity,when you desire.This gives you the ultimate flexibility of being a singular part of a smaller whole or part of the greater whole,Me. 

#### Grouping to Create 

ME:Ijust got a picture in my mind's eye showing lots of entities clumped together to make a bigger entity than they could ever make on their own. 

O:Yes,this is a common occurrence and one that is useful to the entities taking part in the grouping because together they can achieve much more than they could in ones and twos.In essence,they are able to create a smaller version of the Source Entities by being in concert together.Remember the old saying that birds of a feather stick together.Well, there is not a truer saying,for all those entities grouped together in concert that you saw in your mind's eye were of the same opinion. 

ME:What were they doing? 

O:They were solving a problem. 

ME:What was the problem they were solving? 

O:Inter-dimensional connectivity between the uni- verses created by the twelve Source Entities.They are trying to understand the mechanics of how it all stays together as a singularity and a whole.They are also interested in why entities that are integral to the universe that a specific Source Entity has cre- ated have not yet migrated from their environment to another Source Entity's environment,especially as it is not only possible but desirable from an evo- lutionary and experience point of view.The cross- fertilization of entities created by another entity experiencing existence in a universe that is alien to their creation is a most interesting opportunity for in-depth evolution. 

ME:Could it be that we,as our own entity,are happy to be within our own environment and not move into another?After all,the universe created by my Source Entity has more than one universe and a heck of a lot of dimensions and frequencies.It must be a really large place to exist.So large,in fact,that I can imagine it is quite a thing to meet another entity at all-let alone have enough around you to inhabit a planet. 

O:Good observation.This is one of the reasons why your Source Entity is not likely to end this universe quite yet.There is so much to do and so little populace to do it with.There are several eternities yet before the time comes for the disassembly of your universe.In any event,now that you have your own nucleus and surrounding energy to exist on your own as a single entity,you will not just disappear when the Source Entity disassembles the universe if and when the time comes to do so.You will still be present and held within the space that is part of the Source Entity that is not associated with a dimension-spatial environment.You will be waiting patiently to occupy the new environment when it is constructed.I guess this is the question you wanted to ask,i.e.,will we exist past the end of the universe?Well,as I have explained above,the answer is yes.Of course,a Source Entity may create entities that are not singular like you and,as such,these entities would,in fact,return to their base energetic condition when a universe is disassembled.How- ever,that is the choice of the Source in question for He/She/It has the free will to create and change at will. 

ME:Would an entity from my Source Entity be disassembled if it was visiting the universe of another Source Entity which was disassembled? 

O:This has not happened yet because there has not been migration between the different Source Entities'environments.But if this did happen,then that entity would be transported back to its en- vironment of origin by the Source Entity making the universal change,for all Source Entities know which entity is one of Theirs and which is not. 

#### The Origin on Dimensions,Frequencies,and Space 

Another meditation led me to being in contact with the Origin again,and I received a short lecture on mass and frequency.I had just gone through the frequency barrier that I see leading up to the 100th level and into the mass of stars that represent all of the returning souls when I found myself outside of the sphere that I knew represented the Origin in Its entirety.

ME:Why can I see you as the sphere?Why is there dark- ness all around? 

O:You are tapping into the ability to see beyond yourself/Me.The darkness that you see is merely a reflection of you/Me and is not real dimensional/“frequentic”space. 

My mind then turned to the dimensions and frequencies.I wondered if I would occupy the same space if I was accelerated up to the next frequency/dimension. 

O:You would,of course,occupy the same space.Dimen- sional increase and frequency increase do not affect the area occupied by a being. 

ME:But what about the increase in frequency that ice has to be turned into steam?This increases the area in which it exists because of the increase in energy and the resultant movement of the molecules. 

O:This is only true for some matter(matter not associated with a soul or being).The law of the universe is totally different from that currently known and understood by man.A person accelerated up to the next level would occupy the same area because of the will or intention of the being to exist in the same area.This is an automatic function of all beings,no matter what their evolutionary experience and is, therefore,a universal law.
