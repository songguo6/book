### Foreword（前言） 

When I initially started to write this book, I fully expected to focus on the technical aspects of the universe and not the personal progression side as well. Indeed, the start is very mechanical in nature, which can be seen from the way I initially prepared myself to talk about content that was based upon the physics of the universe with the entities, the Origin and the Source Entity. In the early days I needed to literally count myself up the energetic levels to reach those with whom I would spend the next couple of years communicating. The process would occur via my computer on Friday afternoons unless I was on holiday or out of the UK. The subject matter that we discussed over the years chopped and changed from week to week and has had to be edited to make it flow. I also seemed to develop a style of contacting the entities only long enough to generate only a thousand words or so, plus or minus 10-20%, which was interesting, to say the least. 

最初写这本书时，我一心聚焦于宇宙的技术层面，并没有打算谈及个人提升方面的事。的确，本书一开始大概会有些无趣，从我与各类实体、源头实体（以下简称源实体）以及起源谈论内容的方式可见一斑，因为这些内容主要是基于宇宙的物理学原理的。在最初的一段时日，我需要一层一层的让自己在能量层级上往上提升，才能接触到那些后来与我沟通数年的实体。每周五下午，这个过程都会在我的电脑上上演，除非我在度假或者不在英国。在过去的几年中，我们之间所讨论过的主题内容每周都可能会中断或改变，因此我不得不重新编辑以使其流畅。我似乎也养成了一种习惯，即和实体们联络的时长总是只能够写出千字左右的内容，上下浮动10%至20%。这其实也蛮有趣的。

Some of the chapters are clearly longer than 1,000 words while others are 2,000+ words. This depended upon the difficulty of the subject being discussed, or, in fact, how broad it was. Sometimes these words took a couple of hours to generate with every word being painful. At other times it flowed like a river, and it was all that I could do to keep it in my memory long enough to type it into my computer. As you can imagine, this, in itself, generated a level of frustration that at times could stem the flow of communication. 

当然也有些章节显然是多于1000字的，有些甚至2000多字，字数多少取决于所讨论主题的难度，或更准确的说，取决于主题的深度和广度。有时，一些内容要花好几个小时才能诞生出来，每个字都似乎伴随着阵痛。但有时候，他们又如何留般一泻千里，一发不可收拾。我所做的只是尽量记住它，好敲进我的电脑里。你可以想象这个过程本身会产生一定的挫败感，因为输入这件事只会阻碍沟通的流动。

Nevertheless, I have gotten to the stage now where it is time to cut and run, to publish and be damned. I am not a fan of books that are as thick as door stops as they tend to bore me. As a result, I have a deep sense of not wanting to bore my readers with 600+ pages when they could get more enjoyment out of the staggered introduction of the information that I received. It also gives me a break and allows me to pass it on to my editor, who while I am writing this text, does not know this is about to come over the wall. In actual fact, the reason for stopping here is this:(1) I need a rest; and (2) I want to contact the other Source Entities that have been mentioned in this text with a view to describing their universes and giving the world the opportunity to see the wider reality through their senses and achievements. 

不管怎样，现在到了我该放手抽身的时候，是时候让它出版并接受大众的品评了。我个人可不是个对鸿篇巨制的作品甘之如饴的人，因为他们常常会让我的气力吃不消。所以，如果我的读者可以通过阅读我这些原汁原味的接收到的信息而乐在其中时，何必要用一本六百多页的绞尽脑汁润色修饰的巨著来赶走读者呢？这样，我本人就可以喘口气，并把书稿丢给我那在我落笔的此刻还对本书即将交付一无所知的出版编辑。开个玩笑。

I apologize for the changes in style as I progressed, but this is how it came to me. I guess that this in some way adds authenticity to it. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy the reading the text and the things that I gleaned as a result of being able to communicate with these entities. 

So just what does one do when a channeled work is finished? For one thing, I knew that this would not be the last, for I knew that I personally was interested in the universes that were indicated to be controlled by the other 11 Source Entities, each one trying to understand itself and its creativity and feed its own learning back to the Origin. 

Next, it was clear that the concepts that were being presented to me would, in a lot of instances, go straight over my head. Indeed this was the most annoying side of what I was doing, for I really like to understand the mechanics of what I am being shown, no matter how rudimentary that understanding may be. I felt that if I could understand the information being presented to me, then those who read these texts will also understand. I guess the fact that my dear wife, Anne, also understands a great deal of what I have channeled in this book is a result of the high level of understanding that the Source Entity and the Origin have of humanity’s ability to assimilate information in our low frequency existence. In essence, they know what we can digest and offer concepts to wake us up in a manner that we can understand in our limited capacities. 

I was surprised at the duality of the book as it unfolded. First, I would like to remind the reader that this was supposed to be a work that focused upon the history of God and the universe He/She/It has created. I was not comfortable with the dialogue dipping into the more esoteric aspects of how to live our lives to the best of our ability while being of service to others. Also, there seems to be a strong link between the two subject areas, not because of its spirituality but because of the interconnectedness of living life according to the rules of the universe. Going against the physics of the universe ultimately results in our early demise as physical beings but also irrevocably links us to the lower energies of the physical in a way that is truly difficult to reverse without a significant change in our personal nature. Learning to forgive what others do to us is one of the hardest things to do as is shrugging off the greed that we have acquired from living in a materialistic society; however, these two together are without doubt the route to our own personal evolution and ultimately the evolution of humankind incarnate, the route back to the Source and the Origin. 

We have to understand the physics of the universe to understand the esoterics. The two are intertwined as they create the path to correct efficient existence in the other. This helps us go with the flow rather than against it. For this reason, I decided to keep the two types of channeled work under the same cover. The physics and the esoterics. The one provides the living space and how it evolved; the other provides the rules for existence in this space. It would have been logical to create two books and maximize on the sales potential, but that would have been materialistic and would have missed the opportunity for people to have it all in one place, for why would you buy a book when it has only provided one side of the argument and not offered an answer or a way forward? 

Approximately two years prior to starting this work, I had written some 180 pages of my “meditational meanderings,” some of which I noted later were relevant to this work. These I have also included as I now know that they were, in effect, the start of this dialogue and have their own relevance within the text. As such, they are now fully integrated and help to provide a fuller picture of God’s universes and the energetic creatures that exist within them, each of them helping the Origin to understand Its Self and the universe It created through the Source Entities and ourselves. The universes are truly full and vibrant environments, offering myriad opportunities for entities to evolve and, therefore, grow closer to the Source and go home to be part of the whole, but this can't be done without understanding and working with the rules. In reality, this is what this book tries to do—offer us all a way out of the darkness with a light to help us on our way home.

## Part 1 - The Mechanics of the Origins Universe and Where We Fit In

### The Author Awakens 

Throughout my life I have been interested in the paranormal; indeed, I had a constant feeling that I was more substantial than my current self. In one of my earliest memories on this subject I distinctly remember being told by my mother that I could not see the wind when I clearly saw it whistling up and over the roof of a building. I practiced meditation as a young teenager and felt that I could astral travel and levitate/perform telekinesis, even though I couldn't when I tried. I had previously awakened several times in dreams to find that I was out of my body, levitating at will, outside our house. In my late teens I practiced meditation diligently every night trying to gain control of the faculties I was sure I had. Then one morning I had a waking dream. In this dream four white robed individuals stood before me, each of them smiling. They communicated with me by telepathy and told me that all that I believed in was correct. I could do everything I felt that I could do, but not yet! They told me that it was not the right time and that I needed to learn my Earthly lessons first. From that day forward, my interest in the paranormal waned, and I concentrated on doing the best I could in the physical world. That is, until a friend introduced me to Reiki, which led me to other energy healing arts. I became a student of a direct student of Barbara Brennan. My interest was reawakened! During the years of being trained in the energy healing arts, I noticed that I could sense and feel energies. Not only this, I could talk to the chakras to find out what was wrong with them and sense other entities. I also noticed that I could go well above the energy levels taught me by my teacher and was, subsequently, reprimanded for not staying grounded. The problem was that it felt right to be up there. 

### The Author Meets the Om 

It was during one of my initial healing course meditations with a guest instructor that I first met the Om and was identified by a fellow student as being one of them. Little did I know that during a trip to see a friend who was working in Sweden, I would have the connections I required to communicate with energy beings and manipulate energy, thanks to a group of aliens.

### Chapter 1 - Sweden, a Reawakening 

The energy at my friend’s house in Sweden was high. It was surrounded by ley line energy which was not connected and was moving around wildly, rather like a high tension wire whipping across the land, grounding out. The stones at the bottom of his garden felt like they were part of a shrine that focused and directed the ley line energies (rather like the stones at Avebury and Kilmartin). I felt energized. The Author’s Attunement by Aliens to Balance Other World and Earth Energies One day, during a walk with my wife and my friend, I felt the need to go to a certain rock which was by the river. The river was in a small valley. At the rock I had a desire to sit in the lotus position whilst meditating. During the deepest meditation that I had ever experienced, I sensed a lot of light come into my head and my eyes flicker uncontrollably. A voice in my head told me I was being attuned to the Earth energies and that I should stay calm. I also had the impression that a craft of some sort was hovering in front of me. The impression was validated when I saw the strange movement of the water just after I came out of the meditation. During the time I was in meditation on the rock, my wife, who is also quite sensitive, was standing on a suspension bridge upstream. She said she perceived a number of UFOs approach the area, which was a portal between universes. The bridge was at the point of a triangle/cone, and the UFOs were coming in towards the point. She further stated that she was told that the aliens wanted to communicate with me to give me “other world ways of using energy.” To do this, she said they worked directly on me (particularly my brain)—the word rewiring came into mind. After a while, she felt the UFOs leaving and the portal closing. My friend, who also practices the healing arts, said that the stone I was on was aligned to a point on the bridge, and that this was where the energy flow was. He said it was as though the energy collected at the point by the bridge was channelled into the hill via the stone in the river. A year later I was travelling to Sweden again with my friend as a travelling companion as he had moved back to the UK. During the journey I meditated. I logged into the aliens; they were excited that I was coming, and I heard a voice in my head saying, “He is/they are coming.” Beforehand, a strange feeling had come over us in the hours around 11:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. before the flight. Both my friend and I felt a bit lethargic (stunned) and weren't able to think straight. I now know that this was a result of tapping into the energies that the aliens were using, which at that time were overwhelming. I thought I was coming down with a bug or something. As a result, I mixed up the flight times, and we missed the flight. I wondered if perhaps we were supposed to miss the flight for other reasons. Maybe we missed an accident or something. I never did check to see if there were any traffic accidents. Maybe I would have arrived at the wrong time for the aliens and their plans. Maybe I’ll never know. I’m sure there was a reason. We finally caught a flight the next day and arrived without issue. The next day while we were walking towards the river and bridges where the aliens' portal was located, I had the feeling that they were accessing me, especially my autonomic functions. As we walked along the river side path, I felt energy in my hands and arms increase. My friend said that he felt we were going through waves of energy. When we arrived at the bridge, we both knew that the aliens were coming through the portal. I then received a command in my head and walked back down to the rock I had sat on the previous year. I was told that I should expect nothing strange or anticipate anything special/strange happening because this would block the work that they would be doing—more fine tuning and opening of my skills and abilities/functions. As I continued my walk to the rock, I saw images in my mind’s eye of aliens working with machinery and computers. They were getting the machine and equipment ready and tuned into me for when I arrived at the allotted place. Once at the rock, I made myself comfortable, sat in a lotus type position and meditated. I eventually had the impression that the aliens were working on my third eye and were fully opening it so that I could see properly. I was told that this would happen slowly over the next five to ten years. They further told me that they had to attune my third eye to the present time line as it was capable of seeing past, present, and future. They said that I would get confused with seeing this more complex level of information. Suddenly I felt they had turned on my hearing and noticed that, for a split second, I could hear my friend’s thoughts as he stood by the bridge. Then a series of instructions were transmitted to me. I was being told that I should not hang onto any one function that I would receive and that I was to treat each one as a tool and not as my world task or my work or only ability. The initial attuning work in 2002 needed some time to stabilize before it could be turned on. Alien Dimensional Warping Device I opened my eyes, and as I did, I noticed my vision was a bit wobbly at my left and right hand side as if my vision was out of phase with the normal visible spectrum. I thought I saw a large orange object in front of the trees in front of me. The object had no form. I just managed to see similar objects in other parts of the tree-lined bank. Suddenly I picked out the outline of an object that I can only describe as machine like. It was totally invisible, but for a split second or two, I saw its outline and its 3D depth of perception. The aliens told me that they were using some sort of dimensional warping device that made it blend into the background. However, if you had the ability, you would just be able to see its outline as it mirrored the visual appearance of its surroundings. I also noticed that although there was a bit of wind, the trees in the area of the objects were moving like they were being blown by the downwash of a helicopter’s blade. I was then told that I shouldn't try to see these things too hard as I would put too great a strain on the tuning and alignment work they had done. To help the reader understand what I saw, the outline of the craft is in the illustration below. Its visual appearance was like an upside down triangle with a round top and some protrusions on the bottom that I can only describe as being sensor or antenna-like. The trees and surrounding rocks looked as if they were on a convex plate or lens. Figure 1: Illustration of craft outline seen The trees within the internal vicinity of the outline of the craft effectively stood out from their usual environment. A Dimension Within a Dimension As we sat on the rock before going back to my friend’s house, we both felt that the aliens lived here in a complex that was within the hillside and supported by dimensional mechanics. That is, it is a dimension within a dimension, and that this was a local phenomenon. My friend said that he thought the rock was a focal loci for energy between two dimensions and that the rocks either side of the bridge were special because they allow the transference of energies (spiritual, cosmic and Earth) to occur and blend together, creating an inter-dimensional portal. He also thought the abilities of these rocks in this configuration on Earth was rare; therefore, this was a special place. For a day or so after both of these attunements, I felt very wobbly and could hardly string a sentence together, like being mildly drunk. It was a very strange feeling. Some Independent Proof A Contract with Aliens A few months later, I showed some pictures of the landscape around the river and rock in Sweden to a medium I was visiting in the College of Psychic Studies in London. I had not previously talked to her of aliens and my association with them. She immediately recognized the presence of aliens there and clearly stated that I had a contract with them. It was shortly after the visit to the College of Psychic Studies that I started the Barbara Brennan-based energy healing courses where I learned to use some of my abilities and started communication with energy-based entities, two of which are the Source Entity and the Origin.

### Chapter 2 - Contacts with Beings on the

14th Through the 27th Levels Building My Link to Spirit and the 20th Level Over the course of many meditations I often tried to clear my mind to help allow the helpers and other entities from all the other dimensions to connect me or make my link to Spirit. It was during one of these meditations that I noticed their help in action. At the start of this particular meditation, as I allowed myself to be at peace, I noticed a couple of cherub-like entities building what I can only describe as a scaffold of one pole or an antenna like that on a car or transistor radio. It was as if they were putting all the pieces or links together one by one—putting them together until they eventually were high enough to go into the ionosphere and beyond. Each time I let my mind wander and lost focus on the greater reality, it would be as if they would be held in suspended animation. When I pulled myself back into meditation, I would see them start up again with vigor, delighting in the fact that they were able to start building again. As I came back each day, the antenna or link got higher and higher until it was outside our solar system. When I projected myself to the top of it, I could see the rest of my home galaxy below me. When I looked at this construction (2004), I started to see the rest of the other galaxies in my universe coalescing into a single ball of light. When I asked Earth’s Source Entity [you’ll hear more about this Entity soon] about this, He/She/It was very pleased and was surprised at the speed at which I was able to make progress in my meditations—which subsequently helped my helpers to make my link. Note: During the editing of this text for publication (February, 2011), I noticed that the link had progressed beyond the physicality of our universe. The single pole had split off like the branches of a tree, creating a web-like network of connections that ventured through the multiverse of our Source Entity and beyond to the Source Entities’ creator, the Origin, and the eleven other Source Entities (again you will read about the Origin and Its creations later), and the environments They created. It was an amazing sight to behold. Momentarily I felt the Origin as It smiled Its approval. GSN. The 20th Level

Traveling Through the Crown Chakra to the 20th Level The extension of my ability resulting from the construction of this scaffold was illustrated during a morning meditation by an old apple tree in our garden, I had grounded myself by taking in Earth hara line energy through my Tan Tien and was opening up all my chakras when I received the impression that I should also open my higher chakras. To do this, I imagined a trap door that opened upwards above my crown chakra, and I would go through it to the next level. Opening and spinning the chakras was a method I was taught as part of my healing training to assist in raising my frequency levels to those of the levels in the aura or chakra I wanted to work with. I counted up, eight, nine, ten, eleven, etc., to the 15th level where I had been before and then had the impression that I could go higher. I continued to count up the chakras to level 20. At this point I could go no further and felt that this was the highest level I could go to at the moment. A Bypass from the 14th to the 20th Level Upon arrival, I thought about the level where the Om came from and realized that I had just gone straight past it (the 14th level is where I first encountered the Om). I then had the impression that I could create a link of pipe between the 14th and 20th levels so that the Om could come up to the 20th level. I then received the impression that they had, in fact, come up the pipe to my level. I also had the impression that this was the way wormholes are used in the physical levels. A pipe goes from one level to another and then back to the original level but in a different location which then allows instantaneous travel between distant points in the same reality. The Om answered. Om: Om originally came from the 14th but can go up to the 20th and beyond. The only reason that you first encountered us on the 14th was that we needed to go down to the 14th to meet you. You only just understood that there was a 14th level and didn't even consider that there was a 20th. The 14th level is the lowest we can descend because going lower is painful and energy-depleting for us. Going any lower requires incarnation into the physical bodies relative to that frequency. The Om made a big sacrifice by coming this far down in the frequencies, and because of that, you are special. Although it was a big sacrifice, it was essential to their work here on Earth. I felt that other beings, including my guides, were present as well. I asked them why I couldn't see any stars or galaxies at this level (the 20th). They said there weren't any as such at this level and that if I dropped down to the 14th level, I would see them again. This I did momentarily, and I again found myself at the far end of the galaxy (the Om were with me). I returned to the 20th. Om: You are not ready to and are not able to perceive or understand at this level whilst in your earthly body, so the area looks black; however, it serves its purpose. You can get up to that level and communicate without a problem. I was then told that this was enough for that day, and I zipped down the levels and back into my body. Slipping into Various Dimensions and Universes Another meditation saw me rising up to the 20th level. I looked around in my mind’s eye to see if anyone was there, only to find that I was surrounded by entities. Om and others whom I could not identify were present. They were all pleased and honored to meet me. (I was starting to be embarrassed by this.) I also expected to see many stars and galaxies as I do when I visit the 15th level, but I received the answer that the neutral color I was seeing in place of the stars and galaxies was because I was in all levels and all universes/dimensions at the same time. This surprised me, but it did make sense. I then made sure that I was grounded. When I focused my attention on a star system in a particular galaxy, I found that I could go there at will. Slipping into different dimensions/universes was like slipping through the layers of a spherical Russian doll. On my way to another planet, I saw a couple of space ships; one was like a flying saucer and the other like an orb of light. I went into the ship that was like an orb and found myself in a control room of sorts. There I was met by three beings of humanoid shape with big black eyes who bowed with hands together as if in prayer when they noticed I was with them. They also said that they were pleased to see me. I asked them if they knew why I was on Earth, and they said that I was there to evolve. I then asked what my job on Earth was, and they said it was to help the Earth and its inhabitants to evolve. They said that everything would become apparent when the time was right, when I had learned my lessons and had a firm foundation. I then thought about my task in life, and they said I could do two or three world tasks, including my own evolution, all at once because I am multidimensional. This was funny to me because at that time I had been having the feeling that I had been living three or four lives at once! Later when walking to my car to go to work, I had the impression that we evolve faster by incarnating here on Earth because of the short life span and subsequent accelerated learning opportunities. I then noticed that I felt a bit spaced out and heady. This I supposed was because of the level that I was working with. It was good that I was grounded! The Power of Thought The next day when I opened my chakras in the same way, I was aware that I was literally bursting my way through the trap doors that allowed access to the higher levels. When I got to level 20, I stopped and looked around. Again I was surrounded by beings, but this time I had the impression it was just the Om. Om: We are both surprised and pleased in the progress you have made in this short period of time. You are progressing faster than anticipated. ME: Why do you say “we”? Om: Because We answer collectively, not singularly. ME: Why are you surprised? Om: Because the 20th level is very high, and you have to be very grounded. You are learning fast; you are awakening fast. It will not be long before you are fully aware. But don't try too hard as this will block your progression. ME: So where am I now? Om: You are everywhere, in all places at once. I looked out at the universe and found that each universe was represented as a separate sphere. ME: It must take a long time to travel between the universes? Om: Traveling in a higher frequency is easier because the molecules are further apart and create less friction; therefore, they allow you to travel much faster—as fast as the speed of thought. This confirmed what I had previously received and understood in meditation. Om: We use the power of thought a lot. Thought has three parts: thought, intention and action. Thought is the start of the process and initiates the desire. Intention focuses the thought and gives it inertia. Action is the end product, thought taken form. ME: Why do I need to know this? Om: Because it is a universal process, and it is one that you will need to understand and fully believe in the future. The Effect of Alcohol on Evolution I had been thinking about being able to drink the real ale that I love and how it affects contact with my higher self and other beings, including my ability to rise up to the higher levels. I asked the Om a question on this. ME: What part does alcohol have with me? Om: It clouds the communication between your physical and higher self. It removes your intention and, therefore, your focus. ME: Do I drink too much? Om: You were on the verge of it. We do not understand this need to poison your bodies, but your method of limitation and extending your “dry days” slowly over a period of time is a good way of removing dependence. ME: I try to give myself three to four dry days a week now, but I still like a tipple with my friends. Om: Poisoning yourself to be sociable is a very foreign concept to us. I had to go to work then and came down the frequencies by diving down through the trap doors that represented the higher levels until I got to the 7th and my body. The grounding must have worked as I did not feel heady this time. The God Collective Another meditation saw me rising through the levels to the 20th level. I was jumping up the levels in a series of uneven numbers: 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17 & 20th. This I found surprising and wondered for a moment why this was. I was suddenly told that this was because of my intention. I was reminded of the three stages of thought: thought, intention, and action. ME: Who am I talking to? One of the Om? HSME (Higher Self ME): In a figure of speech, yes, but it is you. You are speaking to your higher self and your higher self is Om. ME: I wonder what we are going to talk about today? HSME: We can talk about whatever you like. It depends upon whether you want it to be about mundane or interesting things. ME: Should I wait until I am at my computer before I start to talk to you, so that I can remove the forgetting bits and pieces process. HSME: You can if you want, but would you have the time to do it? This works for you and not all of the information you get will be required to be presented in the conversational format. ME: Why pick that method? HSME: Because it makes it easier to read and, therefore, accessible to everyone, not just the intellectuals. The conversational method is a very good way of conveying the information you will be receiving to the general public. I then saw an image of a bacterium, which was round in shape, with billions of small tentacles surrounding its periphery. HSME: That’s right. That is a good image to use to describe what we are. We are all tendrils or sensors of the main entity going out to learn information and bring it back to the whole. Some of us want to return, and some want to remain in the learning/experiencing loop or even help other tendrils in their process of learning/experience. Do note that we still retain our singularity even though we are part of a collective, as our knowledge gained is specific to one Source and that Source can be recognized. ME: You just said “we.” I thought we are all one. How can God be “we”? Does that mean there are other Gods? I was having difficulty seeing how big this was in terms of how the universes/or continuum could create more than one god-like entity. My limited Earth mental capacity was truly limiting my ability to understand this concept. HSME: If you would take a temporal or dimensional slice of the cake at any one time, you would see Us, we the God collective, as separate entities separated by thin slices of dimensional layers or time. Don't forget that although time is an Earth concept, it will do for this explanation. All you would be doing is seeing parts of Us, We, Me, God (the bigger part of us) through different layers of reality. Separate out all these realities, and you have many Gods/beings. Put them all together, and you get one being, one God that exists in all times, in all spaces, in all dimensions, in all continuums at the same time. Consider the total entity or God as a tall building, the number of floors representing the total number of dimensional realities that I, We, God encompass. Each floor is a reality all of its own with people/civilizations working and living on that one level only. The beings on a particular floor experience Me, We, God only at that one level, that one part of God that covers all of their level of existence, one level of the building. Put all the levels together, and you make a tall building or an entity that covers all of the beings in all of the levels all at the same time. That is what We, You, God is—an entity that is literally everywhere simultaneously. The point is to get as many people in the world questioning their environment and paradigm as possible. ME: I have to go now. I need to get to work, and I am late. I hope I don't forget this stuff. HSME: You won't. I will make sure that you remember. Let’s go over it again in brief indicating topic headings. This we did, and it only took a few seconds to get some topic datum so that I could remember. I then went back down the frequencies, again missing a couple of levels at a time until I arrived at the physical levels. I walked to my car and thought, “I hope I don't forget.” “You won't,” came the reply from a distant place in my mind. My higher self was still in communication with me! The Myriad Shapes and Sizes of Galaxies Another meditation saw me once again soaring up through the levels and landing in the 20th level rather like jumping on the edge of a rather comfortable bed. As I sat there, I saw all the other galaxies in the third dimension and was told by an entity that I could change my view at will. I zoomed in on one of the other galaxies rather than the one I was currently close to. I had no idea which galaxy it was; it looked pretty similar to our own Milky Way, but I was told that it wasn't. I was then advised that I could see the galaxies in another dimension, one where the ambient light was actually white rather than the black of interstellar space. In this dimension there were many different shapes and sizes of galaxies: from flat shapes to totally round shapes to shapes that were like a red ball in the middle with two corkscrew-like tendrils of stars trailing off in an upwards and downward fashion, and others looking like they were just pillars of light. I was told that there are as many sizes and shapes of galaxies as there are stars in the galaxy that Earth inhabits. On this note, I descended down the levels to my 7th level home and went to work. The 27th Level
 Meeting the Dragon The next day I was opening my chakras and realized that I was not totally in my body. I was slightly beside and above myself. I raised my level up to the 20th level, this time going one level at a time. When I reached the 20th level, I felt that I could go further because the 21st level felt easy to penetrate. I pushed harder and established that the next levels up to the 27th level were pretty much the same in response. Moving from one level to another was like pushing my hand through an elastic curtain that suddenly gave way when I pushed past its elastic limit. At this point I realized that I needed to be grounded and quickly sent a line down the levels to the Earth plane and imagined that I had placed an anchor in the ground with the line attached to me. When I completed the grounding work and looked around the 27th level, I noticed that there was another being by my side. The level looked black all around me, and I perceived the being as being black on black and rather dragon-shaped. D: What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. ME: Why not? D: You are not the right vibration level. ME: Why is it so black and dark here? I thought that the 27th level was full of light. D: It’s black because that is all you can perceive here. ME: Why are you dragon-shaped? D: I am trying to frighten you away, but it obviously didn't work. ME: I thought everything here was supposed to be good. D: We are mostly, but you shouldn't be here. ME: If I am not the right vibration level, how did I manage to get here? D: You just used brute force and pierced the veils between levels. I sense that you are stronger than you could possibly know. ME: O.K., I must go. I also have things to do on the Earth level (go to work). The Difficulty of Decoupling from Levels Above the 20th Level As I descended, I got the impression that it was actually difficult to decouple myself from the levels above the 20th. I felt that I was traveling down a tube with graduations printed on the outside and that the journey down was constrained to being in this tube. I think upon reflection that I had found another shortcut or was allowed to use this shortcut to get me out of the 27th level ASAP. The 60th Level
 The Necessity of Grounding on the 60th Level The next day after the trip to the 27th level, I opened all my chakras and decided to go up to the 27th level again just for a look-see. I shot up the levels and hardly saw the numbers in my mind indicating where I was. I noticed that I was missing numbers and that I was leap-frogging levels. When I got to the 20th level, I kept going and noticed that I had accumulated quite alot of momentum and was literally tearing up the levels as I went—so much in fact that I completely missed the 27th level. I had a mere glimpse of the outline of the dragon on the 27th level as I flew past! Surprised, I saw the 30th, 40th and 50th levels go past me before I finally managed to focus my attention on stopping. I finally stopped on the 60th level and realized that I should send out a line to the Earth plane to ground me. I quickly did this as I envisioning a hook truly embedded in the ground and a rope leading up to me. I wondered how I could have gotten so far when the dragon on the 27th level had told me that I shouldn't have been there. I looked around, and it felt like I was on the outer edge of what looked like a very big onion with all the layers representing the levels I had just traversed. A voice then spoke to me. The Author’s Home Base V: You got here because you can. ME: How can I get to this level when the dragon entity on the 27th said that I shouldn't be there? V: Because you live here, you come from here, and you traverse all these levels all of the time. ME: Who are you? Are you my higher self? V: In a way I am you, and you are me. ME: So you are not my immediate higher self then. V: No, but we are one in the higher sense. ME: So are you the entity we refer to as God or the Source Entity? V: Yes, you could call Me that. ME: If this is the 60th level, are there any more levels? V: There are many above and below your current position. ME: Why did the dragon entity not know that I could traverse to his level and stay there? V: Because it saw you for what you currently are, an incarnate being in the lowest levels. ME: Oh, I see. Can I come here again? The next response came to me as I typed this. V: Yes, but remember where you come from and the work you have to do. Don't get distracted. It's easy to get distracted. ME: O.K., I will try not to get distracted. I had best be going now—low level work to do. V: Go in peace. As I descended the levels, I noticed that I was again dropping down the levels in decades rather than in single-level numbers. As I passed the 27th level, the dragon entity noticed me passing and issued a friendly word of advice. D: Be careful. Don't get lost! ME: I will. Thank you. I then slowed down as I got to the sub-20 levels and finally stopped as I integrated with my Earthly body. This is one trip I didn’t expect. An Explanation of the Levels
 Reasons for the Presence of 100 Levels A morning meditation in August 2003 saw me connected with my hara line. I opened up my chakras and wondered what I was going to receive this time. As my thoughts went to the number of levels and the Source Entity’s comment that there were levels above and below the 60th level, I found myself being told that there are 100 levels. I was a bit suspicious of this as it is too round a number. I then heard the voice of the Source Entity in my mind: SE: Why not a hundred? It suits my purpose. ME: It's a bit of a round number, that’s all. It would provide suspicion. I am surprised that you can contact me at this level (I was only at the 7th, maximum). SE: I can talk to you at any level. My thoughts went to the 27th level and the dragon entity. SE: That entity no longer has the appearance of a dragon, but he will use it when you need to contact him. It will help you to discern/recognize who it is. ME: O.K. Why did you choose 100 levels? Why not 12 or 96? SE: I chose 100 because it gives the individual soul something to strive for. I could have had as many levels as there are souls in the multiverse, but 100 sounded like a nice number. It's also a number which is recognized by most of the incarnate beings in the multiverse. Each level gives an increase in possible knowledge, ability, and understanding. A soul can only progress through the levels by the process of experience gained. Differences Between Levels ME: So what is the difference in the levels? SE: They are a distance away from Me. The closer a soul gets to returning to me, the higher up the levels it is able to access or live within. Each level is like the differences in the auric and body levels with the exception that once you have evolved past the need to incarnate in the lowest form (what you are in now) or you no longer need to help out in the physical levels, you move upwards and exist in the higher levels, but you are still subject to the need to evolve to get closer to Me. It's just that the evolution is done on a much finer scale. The difference between the levels that you currently exist in (1 to 7) is quite marked. The difference in the levels above, say in the 50s is much more subtle as you are now focusing your evolutionary attention to specific issues, issues that are really the very fine detail. Relationship of Levels and Dimension ME: How does this relate to the need for dimensions? SE: Dimensions allow for many things to be done at the same time. To put it another way, it allows the individual part of Me, You, the soul to evolve faster as you are learning and experiencing many things at the same time. Call it parallel processing. ME: Fascinating, so we really are multidimensional. SE: Of course. The Mission of Enlightenment ME: Is it O.K. for me to put this stuff in a book that I propose to write? SE: Yes, of course. It all helps in the mission to enlighten people. I am not saying it will make you famous or make money, but it will fill in some of the gaps that others have left out. It is important for the whole picture to be made available rather than just parts of the picture. Everyone who is helping to accelerate the evolution of humankind on Earth at the moment is one part of the jigsaw; each is just as important as the other. It's just that some will resonate with more people than others, and, as a result, they will become more popular, making the individual writer more money by default. But they all are important; they all add to the whole. Money is NOT the issue here. ME: O.K., I have to go now. Can I talk to you on this subject again? SE: You can talk to Me at any time. You don't need to rise up to the 20th or 60th level to contact Me; all you need is the intention. Back to the 27th Level
 The Dragon Entity on Helping Others Awaken The following day I connected with the hara energy and opened up my chakras and waited a moment before going up the levels. When I eventually decided to move up the levels, I moved straight to the 20th. I thought this was a bit too fast, so I decided to start from the bottom (7th) and work my way up level by level. I have to admit I was surprised by how fast I went to the 20th. Then I decided to move to the 27th level to visit the dragon entity. When I got there, the entity welcomed me and I gave him my love. He then transformed into the light being I had expected to encounter at this level. He had the appearance of a human figure wearing brilliant white robes. His skin and the robes emitted a brilliant white light. Even though he was now transformed, I will still refer to him as the dragon entity for continuity. D: The Source Entity is pleased with you. ME: Why is that? I haven't done anything special. D: He was pleased that you were able to contact Him. There are not many people who have managed to do that. Although all are able to, very, very few do. This is because most people are tied up with living their lives and doing what they need to do to evolve; they are totally engrossed with living on the Earth plane. People who contact Him/It are starting to or have already awakened to who they really are. When they do this, they naturally want others to experience the same wonders they are experiencing and then dedicate themselves to the greater task of enlightening the rest of humanity. Their ultimate aim then is to raise the vibration levels to a point where everyone is enlightened or awake again. They do this by spreading the word as you are with this book and discussing this subject with others who are open-minded enough to also spread the word. The Great Catastrophe ME: Why would they want to do this? D: It is just the same as anyone who has been involved in an accident or a great catastrophe (such as the great forgetting—that was a huge catastrophe!). The survivors naturally help those who are injured with a view to saving their lives because they would want someone to help them if they were in the same situation. ME: So this is the same for those who either are enlightened or in the process of waking up. They naturally want to help others become the same? D: Yes, and this is why the Source Entity is pleased with you. He now has someone else helping Him/It to get the other parts of Himself/Itself back to Himself/Itself faster. ME: Oh, that’s beautiful. D: It certainly is. ME: O.K., I must go now. I started to go down the levels one by one, and as I did so, I heard the dragon entity call to me. D: You can go straight to the level you want, you know. All you need is the intention, but you already know this. I dropped down to the Earth plane thinking, “He's right. I don't need to go through each level. I can just pick a number.” The Source Entity Identifies the Dragon Entity as Byron The next meditation was short but nevertheless interesting. I connected with the hara, opened my chakras, and went directly to the 27th level where the dragon entity being was. Again he was radiating a brilliant white light. I then perceived an iridescent golden light in the shape of a sphere next to him (I will refer to this entity in the masculine as it is easier to have one point of reference). I knew instantly that this was the Source Entity. SE: I am gold because this is what people expect to see. Also, it differentiates Me from the other entities when we are together, and I represent Myself as a similar size to My creations. He appeared to be hovering above and to the right of the dragon entity. SE: His name is Byron, and he will help you with your questions. This is a better name than the dragon entity, is it not? ME: Yes. I thought I could contact You personally. SE: You can. You are contacting Me through him through yourself. We are all connected, and We are all one, are We not? He will be your guide. When you need to speak to Me directly, you will. ME: I have to go now. I was late anyway. SE: You always need to go, but even these little sessions are useful. Characteristics of the Om Entities The next meditation I had saw me going straight to the 27th level and seeing Byron immediately in my mind’s eye. I was interested in what Byron did in his level, so I asked him. ME: Where do you live in your level? B: On a planet in a solar system in a galaxy in a different universe than you and, of course, in a different dimension. ME: Do you have a physical existence? B: Not in your sense of the word, but things can be considered as physical in the dimension and level that I exist within. ME: What do you do on your planet? B: We do things similar to you. We live to evolve and get closer to the Source Entity. We work on a universal level. ME: Do you incarnate into bodies? B: Not in the way that you do. We exist for as long as we want in the form that is necessary for the environment for as long as we need to do our job. ME: What is your job? B: To evolve and to help the planet evolve and to keep the frequencies high. We all work to keep the frequencies high. Most of what we do is for the whole; we work for the whole to ensure that the whole is able to progress together. ME: How do you do this? I was receiving pictures of people working with the Akashic records. B: We are collective beings; all of us are linked so all work we do is for the good of the whole. ME: So you are part of a gestalt collective? B: We are still individual, but we are one and all. We do not ignore one another or work against each other as your race does for the benefit of the individual. We work for the all; we all want to progress towards the Source Entity at the same time. We get great satisfaction in this goal. ME: Can you create things by pure thought? B: Of course, one only needs the intention. The Om’s Work with the Akashic Records ME: Do you work with the Akashic records? B: That is some of the work we do, but this is for the greater whole. We look after histories and knowledge. ME: I get the impression that the histories are past, present, and future. B: That is a reasonable assumption for a being that is tied in one dimensional time for most of his consciousness in this incarnation. There is more to it than that because we record the full range of experiences (emotion, pain, joy, love, stress, telepathic communications, etc.) that go with the knowledge. The list of experiences we record is too long to mention here, and again this is only some of the work we do for the greater whole. The Author as an Om ME: Do I always have to meet you at the 27th Level? B: To initiate communication, yes, but once you have linked in and your intention is to communicate with me, you can move around to the other levels and still communicate with me. ME: Why is this? B: You are of the Om, and you are able to move around a number of levels. I think you can go up to the 80th. ME: Are we the same type of entity? B: We are similar but not the same. The similarity is insomuch as we are energy-based beings and not of the low density/vibrations and levels needed to become incarnate as you currently are. ME: What do the Om do? The Focus of the Om B: They do what most highly evolved beings do; they work for the good of the whole with the express goal of returning to the Source Entity. The Om also help the spirits on the Earth plane since this is a pivotal experiment. There are many Om working with the Earth, and you are one of them. ME: Earth is an experiment? B: Yes. ME: What is the experiment? B: To pave the way for individual free choice rather than collective choice. This is required as it allows faster evolution of the entities involved. It has been interesting to see the progression up and down the frequencies. ME: I hope I will be able to remember all of this when I finally type it up. B: You will always remember, and I will always be with you when you are typing. ME: Thank you. I went down the levels to the Earth plane, and as I reached the Earth level, I heard his voice in my head say: B: Be careful on your motorcycle. It was a nice day, so I was going to work on my old 1977 Triumph Bonneville. ME: I will. Byron on Intention and Mental Constructs A week later I went straight to the 27th level, and Byron was there waiting for me. I greeted him. I then perceived that we were standing on a balcony with a steel railing and looking out into space with a couple of planets very, very close by. B: This is an example of what we can do by using a mental construct. The next thing I knew we were looking over a gorge or valley that looked like it could be Earth. ME: This is impressive. How do you do this? B: We simply have the intention and follow through. We were then back in space. Byron had taken me back to the same position with the planets close by. B: This is your solar system. ME: How can the planets be so close to each other? B: I have brought you to a point in time in your vibration level where they were close together so that you can have a good view. ME: Do you use space ships to travel in space? B: Not usually. We generally just go wherever we need to go by using our intention. If we need to come into your vibration levels and travel in physical space, we need to construct a mental barrier to protect ourselves. ME: Are these what we call UFO's? B: You have many ways of perceiving them. You see them as golden orbs and even disk-like space ships. You interpret the information in your own ways, depending on what your physical knowledge is and what your mental capacity is for dealing with such information. The object is to show you that you are only limited by your own imagination—an imagination that is limited by your experience of what you believe can be done here on the Earth plane. You could do quite a lot, but you don't fully and unequivocally believe that you can do certain mental tasks and functions, and so, therefore, you fail. Byron on Spherical Time Today Byron said as I reached the 27th level, “I am going to tell you about time.” This I thought would be interesting as I believed I was quite adept in the philosophy of how time worked. B: Time is spherical. ME: What? (Out for a golden duck! [See Glossary.]) How do you mean? B: Time is spherical. All the events in time that have ever happened or will ever happen are happening now or are all happening at the same time. ME: Can you explain what you mean? B: Basically your perception of time is linear with three points: a past, present and future. You don't perceive an end point, and you can't remember a starting point. However, you do know where you are currently, or so you think, so you perceive the future as in front of you and the past as behind you. ME: You mean we think of time as in a straight line. B: Yes, but this is not the case. Everything that has already happened and will ever happen is happening all at the same time. Call time a finite series of happenings. If you travel in one direction in the sphere, you will experience the events that are a result of that which has gone before in that direction. But if you change direction . . . ME: A whole set of other interactions take place that causes that event to take place? B: That’s correct. If you travel from event point A to event point D via event points B and C, you know what other events took place to get to point D. However, if you went from event points A to D via B1 and C1, another set of events could have occurred to change the event point D, or not change it, as the case may be. Actually you can also use the term “holographic” to explain the happening of events since the sphere has an interior and not just a surface. ME: Why is time finite? B: Because the Source decided when our departure would end, and we would all be together with the learning and experiences completed. Hence, the task is finished and the individual concept of events happening is, therefore, no longer necessary and is removed. Overlapping/Simultaneous Time and Space ME: How does this relate to space? B: Obviously there is physical space, non-physical space (higher frequency or spiritual), dimensional space, and level space—all happening at the same time. All happening together is a better way of putting it. You can travel to wherever at whatever event point instantaneously and experience what is happening at that event point when you get there. ME: How does level space come into it? I thought the levels were relative to the auric bodies. B: They are up to a point, but when you get past the relationship with the physical worlds and you get closer to Me . . . Levels of Perception ME: Hang on. Who am I talking to now? (I had noticed the voice change). Am I talking to the Source Entity? SE: Yes. You see, the closer you get to Me, the more like Me you become as an individual, so you go higher up the levels until your bodies are My body. They are anyway, but it will help your conception to consider them as being separate for a moment or two. Essentially, the higher your perceptions of the levels between us, the closer to Me you get. This distance is called the levels of perception or auric body levels at your position in the game. ME: And all this is happening at the same time. SE: Yes. You can perceive or visit any point in time in any level of perception in any dimension in any spiritual frequency you want. If you had the mental capacity (and at this point in time you haven't), you could experience it all at the same point or from all the different points. I refrain from using the word time here, as it is misleading. My head was spinning as I thanked them both and came down the levels to the Earth plane. This head wasn't big enough. The Fallacy of the Time Loop The next day we talked about time again. I was back with Byron. B: Time is not linear as you now know, and because of this, the popular depiction of the time loop doesn't exist. ME: What? I thought that this was a well-proven theory. What about the classic grandson killing the grandfather scenario? B: Yes, provided that you are in linear time, and you assume that the time line change is such that the grandson’s existence is terminated, but time isn't linear. When you consider that the time line—really a series of events—is changed and the effect is that the grandson is still born but has a different grandfather, then the need to go back in time to kill the grandfather may not exist, and the time line continues. You could also consider that once the grandfather is killed, the grandson stays alive in that time event because that has not changed his personal time line. The series of events after this event, i.e., that his parents were the same, compensate for the change. Everything that has ever happened or will happen is happening now, so the natural thing for the event stream to do is go from the nearest event to the next event that should have happened because it has already happened. ME: Has this something to do with time being spherical or holographic? B: Yes, remember that you experience time as a number of events and that each event and all its variations are happening all together. Hence, the individual who traverses the events to affect an individual person in one event switches to another event automatically, one that is similar to but not exactly the same as the one he was just part of. ME: So this means that the loop theory fails. B: Yes, of course. ME: This is taking some time to get my head around, even with my interest in temporal concepts. B: It’s bound to. You exist in an environment where it is hammered into you that time is linear.

### Chapter 3 
 Byron and the Source Entity Visits at the 100th Level

 Appearance/Forms of The Source Entity and Byron In a later meditation I decided to go to the 60th level bypassing all the other levels on the way up. I then decided to go up to the 100th level. When I arrived, I sensed the Source Entity. The Source Entity visually appeared to be like a galaxy or nebula in a space that was all black. I was positioned on the edge of this nebula. I spoke to the Source. ME: So this is what you look like. SE: Yes. I have no form, but I have form. Byron suddenly appeared by the side of me, but his appearance was not that of a humanoid. He also looked like a loose ball of energy. SE: This is what Byron really looks like. When he is with Me, he has no need to look as you or any other being that communicates with him would expect him to appear, so he adopts his natural state. ME: I thought he lived on the 27th level. SE: He does, but I brought him here to let you see what he really looks like. ME: Can only people who access the higher levels, the 60th and above, speak with You? SE: I will speak to anyone on any level if they wish to speak to Me, but generally it is only people who are evolved enough or remember who they are that are able to visit the 60th level and above that manage to contact Me the way you have just done. I use the 60th level as a buffer. ME: That’s interesting. I will chat about this some more tomorrow. SE: I will be here. The Source Entity—Time as an Event Stream The next day I decided to go back to the 100th level and talk with the Source Entity again. I went straight there with no need to jump up one level or a series of levels at a time. SE: Ah, you're back. ME: It's been exactly a day on Earth. How long has it been for you? SE: No time and all time. It is as if you were never away, or you have been gone two years. ME: Oh, where is Byron? I expected him to be here. SE: He is doing things in his realm. ME: So did You notice me gone? SE: I noticed a lack of attention on your behalf. ME: How do You experience time? SE: All at the same time and one event at a time. It depends on what I want to focus on; it can be fast or slow. You will also experience time this way when you return to the energy state and to the Source/Myself. My thoughts went to the comments that the late Adrian Divir made in is his book “X3, Healing Entities and Aliens” about communicating with aliens. He talked about only a week having passed between communications with a particular individual, but the alien he was communicating with said that a year had gone by in his dimension. The Source Entity picked up on my thoughts. SE: That is because they are experiencing the event stream (or time as you call it) at a different speed. It is also why they appear to travel and change direction very quickly when they are seen in their craft in your dimension. They are going in and out of their event stream and your event stream to aid their travel in your dimension. The result is that they seem to appear and disappear or move and change direction very fast. The aliens haven't contacted you yet, but they will. As I pondered on this comment, I saw the Source from a distance. It appeared as a vast galaxy of energy in the darkness. I tried to enter its light, and the Source spoke to me. SE: You can't come in here yet. You are not capable of experiencing the total unconditional love of the Source in your current incarnate form. You will, of course, when you are disincarnate (in between lives) and when you return to Me but not now. It will distract you. Contact with Aliens ME: O.K., I understand. What about the aliens? Why have they not contacted me yet? SE: They have on the subconscious level, but they find it hard as your mind is too busy. You are truly multidimensional in your mental activity, but you need to allow yourself to focus on one thing at a time. This will allow them access to you. The “Violet Flame” meditation you are doing is helping, but you need to be more resolute. Only when you have quietened your mind will they be able to contact you properly. Also, you try too hard when you start things. You are too intense; this acts as a block. You need to let go and go with the flow. Only then will things happen. You are getting there, but do it slowly and don't try to force it. ME: Thank you. I will do my best. SE: Don't try your best, just be. Sometimes just “being” is the best thing to do. This is at the heart of meditation. You should try it. Byron on Just Being One morning meditation I found myself just being and not trying to contact anyone, such as the Source or Byron. B: Just being is sometimes the best thing to do. It slows the mind down. ME: Who is that? Is that the Source? Where is Byron? B: This is Byron. ME: Oh, hello. How can you contact me on this level? I am still on the Earth plane. B: I can contact you on any level; it is only you that have decided to come up to my level to communicate, and you think this is the only way. This is no longer necessary. Not convinced, I shot up to the 27th level to see Byron. We walked in a lovely wooded glade filled with flowers. B: Just being is one of the best things you can do. It allows you to just be yourself without the urgencies of the material world. It allows you to think and rationalize and communicate with yourself properly. It will slow YOUR mind down, allowing you to access the spiritual side of yourself, the real you. ME: How is this? B: Your mind races with a list of things to process; it is constantly planning and scheming on things/jobs that you believe are more important. They appear to be so important that they even override your ability to meditate. This is your conscious mind fighting for supremacy, for it knows that it will eventually lose control of your Earthly existence as you become more spiritual. It wants to perpetuate itself. It will even try to disguise itself by being part of your spiritual agenda and making you think that you need to have your abilities now. In effect, it will make you try too hard and subsequently block your progression—a perfect way to maintain its existence. ME: So just being really is good for you? B: Yes, provided you don't focus on it as a means to an end and make it formal. Just enjoy the moments when they appear and don't think that you need to communicate with me or the Source and write something every day. Accessing One’s Core Essence/Core Star I discussed the just being principle with my wife one night, and I mentioned the information I received about it being an essential part of getting in contact with our core essence. I also talked about the feeling that I had been getting that the material world was feeling more and more like an illusion. I said that I thought “The Matrix” movie was a very important concept for people to think about in terms of understanding the difference between the realities of the spiritual world compared to the great illusion of the material world. We also discussed the need to access levels individually when we are in contact with our core star. We considered that when we are in contact with our core essence, we will be operating on all levels at the same time and will not, therefore, need to think about going to a level to communicate with an entity or being. This also came up in my morning meditation the next day. SE/B: Just being is a key part of getting in contact with your core essence. ME: Who am I speaking to? The Source or Byron? SE/B: Both of us and one of us, for we are one and the same. You understand this on a deeper level. ME: I am getting the feeling that I no longer need to “go” to a level to communicate with you. SE/B: That is correct, for when you are in contact with your core essence, you are truly everywhere and at all levels at the same time. You just are. You don't need to go to the 127th level to contact Me. ME: Hang on. I thought there were just 100 levels. SE/B: There are only 100; it was a figure of speech. However, an individual may want to split the levels up so that he/she is able to take the evolutionary level jump at an easier pace. ME: O.K. You were talking about the core essence. SE/B: Yes, the core essence is the real you. It is your essence in the fullest sense of the word. The core star can be considered as a database of all your experience and existence—all that you have done, will do, and are doing. Once you access this, you will fully understand and believe that the material world really is the great illusion. You will understand that you are energy and that you can manipulate energy. In being able to realize and fully believe this, it will become your ultimate reality. You will realize that you can manipulate energy in the material world, as well as affect the material world reality. A master knows and fully understands and believes this, for he is who he really is. This is how a master can do things, like dematerialization, teleportation, and telekinesis, etc.—all the things that will get the attention of the people in the material world, the so-called hard evidence of a higher order of things. A master can do this because his belief is unequivocal. He is himself incarnate in the material world together with all the knowledge, understanding, and experience of the universe and God, for he is one with God and the universe, and the universe and God are one with him. ME: Thank you. That is both beautiful and interesting. SE/B: Of course, it is the nature of everything. All is in balance when understanding is finally achieved, and belief is replaced by knowing. Getting in contact with your core star/core essence allows you to get in contact with the real you. It allows you to access who you really are. Removing the Veil of Separation from Our Real Self ME: But what happens if we remove the veil that separates us from our real self and what we think is reality? Would this not cause mayhem? People would think that all that they have strived for is to no avail. They would realize that there is life after death and that everything is love and light and that this real reality is infinite. Then they’d come to the conclusion that if everything is love and light, then why not have a good time while they are here on Earth. They would abandon the need to strive and work for the evolution and experiences that they came to Earth to experience in the first place. SE/B: That is correct, and that is why a few, and only a few, individuals are able to access both worlds: reality and the material world at the same time. This is because they understand that they are here for a reason and that they must also commit themselves to finish what they started, as well as work with the spirit realms. To do this, they need to be grounded and be able to balance the two worlds of the reality and material. My thoughts went to the Chinese dynasties of the past. SE/B: Yes, that is right. They realized that they were going to reincarnate and that life and their real selves were perpetual. Once they had established this, they decided that it was best to have jam today rather than tomorrow, so they abandoned the need to complete their Earthly experiences and delayed evolution until their next incarnation. They chose to have a life of decadence instead. The result was that this belief was perpetuated beyond the normal life and death cycle associated with reincarnation, and they didn't evolve for several lifetimes. In fact, they incurred quite a lot of karma which has taken some of them many lives to work out. Some are still catching up. ME: So you really do have to be special to work with the spirit worlds within the material. SE/B: Yes, you need to be quite a way up the evolutionary scale and be dedicated to both causes you have taken responsibility for. The Role of the Aliens One Tuesday I opened my chakras and wondered what the subject for today would be. As I thought about discussing aliens, I sensed a presence in my consciousness. ME: Who is there? Byron? The Source? SE/B: The Source, Byron, both of us, as we are one as we are one with you. At this time I wasn't concerned with what levels I was on as I now knew that communication was independent of which level I was on. All I needed was the intention and the belief. ME: What do aliens have to do in the scheme of things? SE/B: They are a part of the bigger picture. They work for the good of the All. Of course, some of them are as ignorant as humans and, therefore, only work towards their own ends. But mainly many of them are highly evolved and are doing everything they can do to support their own evolution and the evolution of others and the universe. They are dedicated to increasing the vibration levels of the universe to bring it back to what it used to be during the time after the separation of My/our self. Humans are part of this because, as you know, independent free will is the great experiment that will allow the universe to evolve faster. Byron on the author as an Om This communication ended as fast as it started, but I was to talk further on the subject the next day with Byron on his own time but with a difference. I was still on the Earth level, but I was talking to Byron via what I visualized as a tube or bypass between the 27th level and the Earth level (level 1). ME: Hi Byron, I am still on the Earth level. How can I talk to you? Are you on the Earth level? B: No, I am still on the 27th level but am communicating to you through a bypass that you have created. ME: Oh, how did I do that? B: I don't know, but it works. A bit confused as to how I created a bypass without knowing how or even that I had created it, I continued with my intended dialogue. ME: I wanted to talk next about aliens and how I fit in. B: O.K., but I will start with a statement of reality first. You are part of a race of beings called the Om. You are a race of light beings that travel the universe visiting different galaxies. ME: How did I get involved in being here on Earth? B: You were made aware of the work that was going on in the Earth plane and understood how important it was and that it was pivotal to the evolution of the universe. In realizing this, you undertook sacred work under the guidance of the Source Entity to help the occupants of Earth remember the knowledge, the truth. ME: It doesn't seem to have worked very well. B: It has but not in the way you wanted it to. You expected there to be centers of excellence for retaining the knowledge and the truth. This happened, but it was abused by the Egyptians and other notable races that used it to control others. Over a number of lifetimes, you have been able to assist in keeping this knowledge and truth alive in the minds of a few dedicated and aware (awake) individuals, Masters, and believers in the truth. ME: So where are we now? B: You and the Om have assisted in getting the Earth back to the condition where knowledge and truth are becoming known and believed by more and more people. We are now at a point where we almost have the critical mass necessary to allow us to raise the frequency of the Earth back up to the levels that it should be. You have reincarnated into a very important time period. The Om are a race of light beings that are one with God. All beings are, of course, one with God, but the Om are higher up the frequencies. When you took on-board the most sacred and important work on Earth, you made a special and massive commitment that has lasted many lifetimes. ME: So what is my work in this lifetime if the critical mass is almost achieved? B: You are to help in the realization process. This is showing the general public the things concerning spirituality that they can relate to and measure. You will show them that this is but just a small part of spiritual matters and that although there is a more physical side to spirituality, this is just for demonstration—to get their attention. Once you have their attention, you will be able to tell and teach them about the reality and truth, the big picture. You will need to be pure of mind, body, and soul, so you had better start cleansing yourself. Byron Introduces Hum The next morning I was grounding myself and opening my chakras when I got the impression that Byron was close to me with there was another entity by his side. He was wearing a silver suit that appeared to have no seams but gave the appearance of a space age pullover type garment. I increased my frequency to that of the 27th level and greeted Byron. B: Hello, this is *******. I couldn't pronounce his name. B: You probably can't pronounce his name, so we will call him Hum. ME: O.K. Why is Hum here? B: He is beloved of the Om, as are you, and he will be able to help you in all your questions about alien races in the universe/s. He will also help you communicate with them so that you can further your knowledge. ME: Why does he wear the silver suit? B: That is so you can discriminate me from him. He will help you with the other races. ME: I have to go now. B: That is O.K. The objective was to introduce you to Hum, and this has been done. ME: Thank you both. Byron on Oneness with Our Higher Self My first morning meditation after coming back to the UK from Crete saw me literally shooting up to the 27th level to see Byron. When I arrived, I felt that I was distanced from myself and was bouncing around like I was on a trampoline. B: Your movement up to my level was too fast for your conscious mind to keep up with. That is why you feel at a distance to yourself and see yourself bouncing around. ME: This is interesting. B: Yes it is. It is one of the ways in which you can contact your higher and true self. You can do this by moving up the frequencies too fast and literally leaving your conscious mind behind. Your conscious mind usually stops you from doing this by making you think of other things, such as those small jobs around the house or garden that you end up doing. You can use this method to get in contact with your higher and true self, which will allow you to operate more in your higher self's consciousness than your physical mind’s consciousness. ME: I have a question based upon the duality of the two minds. On page 259 of Adrian Divirs' book X3, Healing Entities and Aliens, the author mentions that the physical mind and the higher self mind operate in parallel. The higher self mind has a copy of all that’s experienced and recorded by the physical mind and adds it to the larger memories and past life knowings of the higher self and Spirit. When the physical body dies, the physical memories die, and the memories that were recorded by the higher self mind are retained. I find it really disturbing that the person that I currently am appears to really die and that what is retained is just a copy. (My mind went to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s film The 6th Day where people were having their memories preserved and transferred to a clone.) This appeared to give the individual immortality until a clone was released before the original was dead, which illustrated the fact that they were really two people with two memories and not one memory being transferred from one body to another. B: Yes, that is mostly true and is correct for the general population of incarnate entities who are never aware of their higher selves. However, when you are truly in contact with your higher self, you are in total control of who you really are and tend to focus your attention more and more within your higher self's consciousness. You are totally able to access all your previous lives’ memories and information accumulated in your higher self's mind. When this happens, you see the human body for what it is—a vehicle for evolution and not who you really are. Because your attention is now in the higher self rather than the physical self, you experience yourself as your higher self. Your attention is shifted from one part of you to another, the real you. The only problem here is that the individual must try to stay grounded when in this state; otherwise, he/she will appear to become distant (or spaced out) from the physical body. Then it will lose control of it. When your attention is focused on the higher self, you will not experience the feeling and fear of this kind of mental duality. You will be able to move your consciousness freely between the physical and higher self, effectively creating one mind, one set of new cumulative higher self and physical memories and thus perpetuating a feeling of oneness. The greater picture is that once you can do this, you will be able to interface and integrate with the other parts of yourself that are either incarnate or in spirit experiencing the total oneness of your true, true self as a multidimensional being experiencing many things and many incarnations on many planets and many dimensions all at the same time. ME: Wow! Thanks a lot. Now I understand. B: Not bad for a six minute meditation, but, of course, time is different when meditating. And don’t forget that concepts, knowledge, and understanding are transmitted in more than the spoken or written word. Byron on Accessing Higher Self Memories The next day I again went to see Byron on the 27th level and decided to prove the comments he made about moving too fast through the frequency levels. I moved through the levels bouncing around from the 27th to the 15th to the 30th to the 50th to the 100th and down again. I moved so fast that I (my physical mind) was starting to lose sight of my higher self’s mind. I moved from galaxy to galaxy in the blink of an eye. B: You’re losing me, too. I can't keep up with you! I then moved back up to the 100th level where I saw another galaxy form. This I recognized as the Source Entity. He/She/It spoke to me. SE: Remember who you are! I then experienced something totally unexpected. I received impressions of many, many, many lives being lived. I gained glimpses and impressions of pictures and feelings of where I was and where I had been. I was a Byzantine warrior, a Roman, an Egyptian. I saw an aircraft go over my head in Atlantis, I saw structures of buildings on another planet, and I met up with the Om and embraced them. I received the impression that there was far too much for my physical consciousness to comprehend so only fleeting impressions were received and interpreted. Mere snapshots of what was being given to me were grabbed by my physical consciousness and relayed to me. As I write this, I feel that I have been given a gift. When I de-focused my attention from my physical mind to my higher self-mind via core star mediations or simply moved too fast through the frequency levels for my physical consciousness to keep up, I effectively diffused the concentration of physical consciousness to the more diffuse requirement of the spiritual or higher self-consciousness. In effect, I raised my vibration level and expanded my consciousness to encompass the wider corners of self by expanding the horizon of my awareness through diffusion of concentration. In eyesight terms, it would be like fully using your peripheral vision. I was told that this technique would allow me to focus on my higher self’s consciousness to access my higher self’s memories. The Om on Concentration, Focus, and Meditation My morning meditation was proving to be difficult with my mind wandering onto more Earthly pursuits. After I finally managed to calm my mind down, I projected myself up to the 20th level again and looked around. The gap between the 20th and 21st was narrow, so I expanded it so that it was more comfortable. I saw the usual black/grey appearance of this level and then decided that I would expand my awareness to what the real appearance of the 20th level was. It instantly went into a bright white light and at the same time two of the Om came to greet me. They were pleased that I had been able to see what the real 20th level environment looked like. In contrast they looked like wispy black entities, but I perceived that this was only in comparison to the very, very iridescent bright light of the 20th. They told me that this light was pure celestial light. They then said they would give me a lesson in concentration. I thought this was very appropriate. I suddenly found myself on a tight rope (without stabilizers) crossing a canyon in the US with the knowledge that I had to concentrate 100% on the task at hand or risk losing my life. I felt the level of concentration as being total engrossment. I was one with the wire I was walking on and knew exactly where to place my feet and how to distribute my weight. There was nothing else in the universe that mattered; I wasn't even interested in the wonderful view or the birds that flew by me. I was totally focused on the task at hand. Afterwards, I returned to the 7th Earth plane levels. What an excellent example of concentration and focus! This experience helped me tremendously to understand this concept. The next day I started my meditation and closed all of the doors off on the downwards spiral staircase that represented my thoughts. Each door represented a different thought and, therefore, a different distraction. I opened up all my chakras and rose up to the 20th level pulling up some friends (who I assumed were some of the Om, who were on the 14th level) at the same time. They then re-emphasized the previous day's lesson on concentration. They stipulated that the tightrope walker was an excellent example of pure 100% concentration. The level of concentration was such that nothing outside of doing the task at hand was important. A tightrope walker needs to dedicate those minutes of his life purely to walking the rope. He/she cannot allow any outside influences to intrude or distract his concentration. This is the level of concentration that is necessary when meditating. Om: You must be dedicated enough to allow the short period of time to be used in the meditation process and nothing else. I then had a fleeting thought about looking at my watch to find out what time it was since I had to go to work soon. The Om picked up on this instantly and said that this is exactly what they were talking about. Even this minute distraction was enough to cause a downward spiral of lack of concentration. Om: The ten or so minutes of meditation should be considered sacred, and no other thoughts should be allowed to interfere with it. The distractions are only the conscious mind’s desire to take control again. It feels that when you are accessing the higher self-mind, it is somehow losing control and is frightened that it somehow may not get it back. The Source Entity on Preparing for Meditation SE: A number of different ways can be used to still the mind as a prelude to meditation. One is to count the heart beats; the other is to concentrate on the breathing rhythm. A further method is to imagine you are stroking a favorite animal or throwing a ball for a dog. All of these focus the mind on one thing only. You could also think of a big yellow ball above your head and then imagine your spirit rising up to join with it. This also works. Concentration can also be considered a vital part of meditation, and, even classed as meditation in its own right. When you meditate, you need to focus on the meditation and not the idle chatter of your mind that wants to continue to control you and prevent you from accessing your real self. Only when you are fully focused can you meditate properly; focusing requires you to concentrate on the meditation process and only that. Give yourself a little mental note to know when your meditation/concentration is wandering and drag yourself back into focus. Concentrating on something simple is the best route. Celestial Light With this lesson well and truly learned, I commented on the bright light that was the 20th level, and the Om again said this was celestial light. It was not the same as the celestial love experienced on the 6th level. It was the light of all things and nothing, all places and no place, all universes and no particular universe, all times and no time, all dimensions/frequencies and no dimensions/frequencies, all beings in all times, dimensions, frequencies, and universes all at the same time. This is what made the light so bright; everything and everyone was burning so very brightly. I then saw some bright spots that moved around, and I was told that these were other beings that were specifically aligned with the 20th level. That's why they were brighter than the ambient light. My fellow beings looked dark in lieu of all this brilliant ambient light. On the Earth plane they would look like brilliant white/golden light, but here they looked dull in comparison. I wanted to embrace them all and thank them for the lesson and their patience in teaching me. I felt them smile, and I sensed that it really was time to hit the road and go to work. Mixed Remembrance of Memories and Abilities At my next mediation I was more focused and determined not to be distracted. I opened up my first seven chakras to associate myself with the auric levels and then swooped up to the higher levels. When I arrived at the 14th level, I noticed the tube (bypass) that I had put in place to allow the Om to pass up to the 20th level. Upon my arrival, I felt the presence of another being who I assumed was one of the Om. Om: We are impressed with your ingenuity; you are remembering. ME: Thank you. I am starting to remember stuff but not remember it in the way that I want to. Om: Define. ME: Well, I just know that I can do things, such as constructing the link between the 14th and 20th levels, but I can't remember past lives or the places/planets/galaxies/ dimensions where I used to live or even my previous time with the Om. Om: It is interesting that you mention the time before. You really must be next to a computer when you are meditating so that you can write our discourse straight away, but if you can’t, we will make sure that you can remember what we say to you. ME: How will you do that? Om: We will program you with a long term memory function so that you can download what was communicated to you. This dialogue was typed a few hours after the meditation. The conversation flowed back from my mind and into the keyboard. It felt like I was having total recall! The Om on an Image of Om as a Ball of Light I then decided that I wanted to see the celestial light of the 20th level and that I wanted to see the image of the Om. ME: Oh, you look almost human (angelic) to me. Om: That is because this is all your mind is able to cope with in its existing incarnate form. ME: Can I see what you are? Om: Yes, but you will only see us as something you can translate into your current limited understanding, but, you will SEE later. ME: I see you as a ball of light energy. Om: Yes, this is a good example and one that your mind can use as a translation substitute for something that it can't directly place into a recognizable context. You need some form of reference point, a datum from which to work. If you don't have the experience in this incarnation of what an energy being looks like, your brain will use a substitute, one that you can understand as meaning “This is an energy being.” Seeing an Energy Being ME: Oh, do I have to see an energy being, or do I only need to sense or communicate with one? Om: There are energy beings that you will not be able to see because the energy is not visible. It is too refined, too fine to be picked up even with spiritual eyes. You don't really need to see them anyway for you will know their presence and be able to communicate with them, albeit in a limited way. ME: Thank you. I must go now. During these meditations and subsequent recalls, especially when I am typing up the text that forms the dialogue, I am constantly thinking that I am deluding myself, that I am only talking to myself. But it is the speed and subject matter of the information that comes through that tells me that this is more than just talking to myself. Also, some of the information is said in such a way that it is foreign to me. It is then that I know this is not the Earthly me speaking.
