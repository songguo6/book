## Introduction 

Continued Communications with the Origin's Twelve Source Entities In The History of God-A Channelled Work,I gave readers insights into how I started my higher level communications and managed to communicate with spiritual/energetic entities whilst gaining insights into the wonders all around us and the truth about our legends and myths.Through channelling,I also started my identification with The Origin and learned that The Origin created twelve Source Entities.The Origin and one of the Source Entities explained what The Origin is and the mechanics of the universe created by one of The Origin's creations,our Source Entity. In the next book Beyond the Source,I continued my dialogue with our universe's Source Entity and commenced dialogue with the first six Source Entities-those that were closer energetically,so to speak,to my own energies.In Beyond the Source I gained insights into the wonders and workings of the multiverses created or not,as the case may be,by the first six Source Entities.I learned what entities inhabited their multiverses and how the multiverses and,indeed,the Source Entities themselves,were constructed. If you've read these two books,then you will be delighted to know that this book,Beyond the Source Book 2,concludes those dialogues by focusing on Source Entities Seven through Twelve.In doing so,I was taken to the very edge of my capabilities! To say that this was a difficult book to channel would be an understatement.There were times when I wondered whether I was capable of dealing with the information I was receiving and whether I would be able to put it into words that would be understandable without losing the essence of that information offered to me.There were other times when the amount of information I was receiving was so diverse that I had to stop and re-calibrate my own abilities to allow the state of "cosmic knowing"to take over so I could step up a level,take in the vista of a new and bigger picture and accept that I was expansive -capable of being stretched beyond what I felt was my elastic limit.Over and over this happened.In hindsight,the headaches,bags under the eyes and stress of needing to deliver the information resulting from this dialogue was more than worth it-even though I questioned my sanity more than a dozen times whilst in the "thick of it."The world needs to know this information.My dear wife,Anne,has been fantastic in this respect,providing words of encouragement whilst editing text and ensuring I took some essential "down time."Additionally,encouragement from Dolores,Julia and the team at Ozark has been both timely and very well received;for this,I am truly grateful. For those readers who have been following this journey of discovery,those dedicated to wanting to "know the truth,"lifting their personal veil between themselves and the greater reality,I thank them from the bottom of my heart,for in doing so they are helping to raise the base frequencies of the Earth and its population. Thank you and welcome back!

## Chapter One - An Introduction to Source Entity Seven 

Having just finished "Beyond the Source,"I was glad of the proposition of a break.That was not to be.Having finished the manuscript for the communications with the first six Source Entities, I was instantly propelled into the generation of presentation material required to support my lecture at the "Awakening to Higher Consciousness Transformation Conference 2011"hosted by Ozark Mountain Publishing.Once I had finished the slides for the lecture,I started to feel the call of the Source Entity,the creator of our multiverse,to continue with the work of communicating with the remaining six Source Entities.Whatever happened to the rest I was advised to take,I will never know.One thing I did know was that I,along with others,was contributing to the inevitable ascension of the Earth and its inhabitants,and that this work could not be stopped for any reason. Indeed,during the weeks after finishing "Beyond the Source,"I had been receiving images of how the next Source Entity,Source Entity Seven,was constructed and how it environments had been created.A change is as good as a rest,obviously.I was just contemplating the images I had received and was starting to find myself tuning into Source Entity Seven when my own Source Entity offered some kind words of advice. SE:As I stated when we signed off from our last dialogue,you are about to go further away from me than you have gone before.The difference in the frequencies are vast,but the work I have done in the background with you will enable you to build upon the protection required to support each step further away you make. ME:What do you mean each step further away? SE:Your memory is bad today. ME:I have been reading up on the details contained in The History of God,not concentrating on the details of Beyond the Source. SE:So I see.Listen,from now on,the frequential and dimensional distance that needs to be spanned by your consciousness will be stretched to its elastic limit every time you make contact with each new Source Entity.You will get further and further away from your incarnate self's base frequency.The period spent with each new Source Entity will be used to ease this level of stretch,allowing you the facility of stretching to the next Source by using your new "current"position as a stepping stone.I will,of course,be with you at all times, monitoring your progress and helping you adjust to the stretch as and when required,but there will be some side effects though. ME:And what will these side effects be? SE:You will feel like you are both tired and highly energized all at the same time.You will also feel physical responses to these very different frequencies.This will last for the whole time you are in communication with the next six Source Entities.I think you would use the terms“"spaced out'"and“arthritic." ME:You mean the next eighteen or so months? SE:Yes.

ME:Thank you for the warning. SE:It's a pleasure.A word of serious advice here:you need to keep yourself as energetically neutral as possible.This will help with the assimilation of the new energies and frequencies. To do this,drink plenty of water,for it is a "physical"universal energy medium that has a common energy signature across frequencies and dimensions.Reduce the amount of alcohol and coffee that you drink to minimal levels normally and zero levels the day before and on the day of channelling.If you do drink alcohol,cleanse the system directly afterwards with equal amounts of water.You will also need to keep your body exercised and well rested. Me:I don't think I am looking forward to feeling arthritic! SE:Perhaps I used the wrong word.The feeling will be like you have joints that have a warm glow one day and cold glow the next. ME:Sounds like rheumatism to me. SE:But you will not lose the power in your limbs,and it will disappear directly after disconnection with Source Entity Twelve. ME:No ramp down? SE:No ramp down.It will be instantaneous. ME:I can't wait! SE:Then let us commence with the connection to Source Entity Seven.

### Source Entity Seven-A Source Entity of Three Aspects 

As I sat at the keyboard of my computer,I found myself being drawn to an image I had seen before.This image,I now know,is the visual representation of the Source Entity I was due to commence dialogue with-Source Entity Seven (SE7).I approached it slowly at first,trying to make the most of the image I was seeing in my mind's eye and the impressions I was getting. For all intents and purposes,it looked like two cells joined together with an overlapping middle section.As I got closer to it,I gained the impression that it had divided itself into essentially two areas/environments with the overlapping section in the middle creating a third "hybrid" environment,a mixture of the two larger areas.I wondered what we would talk about when SE7 made abrupt and direct contact.

![图2](img/s6-037.png)

SE7:G'day! ME:What? SE7:G'day!...Is this not the correct way to greet you? ME:It's one way to greet someone but not one that I expected from a Source Entity. SE7:No problem then if I access you to understand the best way to communicate? This Source Entity was being very direct for what was essentially a first date!And it had an Australian accent as well!Quite bizarre! ME:Be my guest. As Source Entity Seven accessed my energies,I felt like my head was fizzing and was about to explode.Then it subsided and felt no different than normal. SE7:Ah,that's better.I now know how to communicate in an appropriate manner with you. Ifelt a tension in my head and an energy surge/shift.My eyes blurred a little.The accent was still there though.I decided that I had better live with it. SE7:Sorry,just adjusting to an acceptable frequency for you.You will attune better as we continue with the dialogue. I have to admit I was a little worried about the Australian accent but decided that the best thing to do was to ignore my preconceptions in its use.As I put this potential block in the clarity of our communication path to one side,I received an image and an understanding of its use by Source Entity Seven.Australia was the Earth's largest single country without a land- based border with its neighbors,and,it's the only country that shares the same border with the borders of the continent it's based on.This was the reason Source Entity Seven had chosen to speak to me with an Australian accent.It had recognized this unique condition and had studied the language and culture in order to communicate with me,thinking that most of Earth's incarnate inhabitants existed on this one large area.I also received the impression that it was a reasonable assumption for it to make as this was a common theme with those of its creations who associated themselves with a "planetary"body of sorts.I also noted that it considered Australia as a center of heightened awareness on this planet.With the reason for Source Entity Seven's method of communication now understood,I commenced the dialogue with renewed vigor and no underlying doubt. SE7:Now that you understand the reasons for my choice of verbal communication,we can start if you like. ME:Yes,please.I just found it a little strange at first and wanted to make sure I wasn't being delusional and was inventing the dialogue. SE7:You are most definitely not inventing this dialogue.But I can tell you one thing:you are stretched very thin,and this lack of substance is the reason for your lower confidence level. 

### The Three Versions of Source Entity Seven

ME:I see.Well,I had better overcome that pretty quickly if I am not going to spoil this opportunity.Let's move on then.As I started to log into you,I received an image.It looked like you had arranged yourself into two areas that overlapped in the middle-rather like what two cells look like just before the point of divisional separation.Can you explain the reason for this?It looks like you have three environments:a left,a right and a combination of the left and right. SE7:What you are seeing is actually two of me at a point in frozen separation. ME:You mean there are two of you? SE7:No,there are three.When I was planning how I would best contribute to The Origin's desire to evolve through devolution and separation,I decided to cut myself in half and create two independent but co-existent selves.At the point of separation,I saw the beauty in the possibility presented in constraining the separation to a partial condition.This partial condition-you might call it the "Siamese"section-that which was part of both of me that was separating at that point,developed an independent energetic signature of its own,creating a third version of me.This stopped me from continuing the separation as it provided a number of interesting opportunities. ME:Am I reading this correctly then?You are now three independent but co-joined and coexistent entities,each with different thought processes and different activities? SE7:Yes. ME:Then why/how am I able to talk to you as a single entity?Am I just talking to one of you? Say,Source Entity Seven "A"(SE7A) SE7:No,you are talking to a combined simulacrum of the three versions of me.This I/we have set up to initiate communication with you so that you didn't get confused with each of me talking at the same time,answering your questions simultaneously in three different ways. ME:I thank you for your concern.Are you able to go back to your original singular condition, to that which you were before the point of separation? SE7:No,the change was a permanent change.That is,unless all three of me decide,in fully committed unison,to enlist the help of The Origin to return us to singularity.This permanent change was my singular decision before separation. ME:So you have no over-mind to control you all? SE7:No ME:You have no clock ticking in the background,which will re-set you back to singularity after a certain period of time? SE7:No ME:You have no re-set button to press if it all goes horribly wrong,or you want a change of strategy? SE7:No

ME:Fascinating.When I have talked to the other Source Entities,those that had created areas of separation always had a bail-out facility somewhere. SE7:Not me/us.The change was personally permanent. ME:But you do have the ability to use The Origin to return you back to the singular should you all so wish. SE7:Yes. ME:So that is your collective bail-out. SE7:Yes,I suppose it is.I/we hadn't thought of it in that way.We simply think of it as an opportunity for future experience,should we all collectively seek such a change.Such a change would only be sought by The Origin if all three of me desire it together.It cannot take place if only one or two parts of me want it,but one part does not. ME:Can you merge two parts of you together. SE7:No,for this would upset the equal balance we currently have. ME:Can I talk to you (SE7A,SE7B SE7C)separately as we progress this dialogue later. SE7:If you wish. This was a bit strange and was wonderful all at the same time.Here I was,communicating with what was Source Entity Seven-now in three separate but co-joined and coexistent parts but as a singular entity,this entity or shell being created specifically for communication with me.Ifelt VERY honored.

ME:Can I ask for clarification on why you felt it necessary to communicate with me in the singular rather than the collective. SE7:Certainly,but first though,I see I need to give you a short lesson on singularity vs. collectivity vs.singularity through collectivity,for they are three different things,as is why I am able to communicate to you as a singular entity even though I am now three.We have,of course,created many others to assist in our evolution,as your Source Entity has.That is why you exist,but I will continue with defining singularity,collectivity,and singularity through collectivity. 

### Singularity 

SE7:Singularity is when you have a unique and individualized entity that is independent of any other entity or group of similar entities.Although created and still part of its creator,it is given individuality as a sub-section of the entity which created it.A singular entity does not need to nor is [it]required to follow rules or conventions or styles of or for existence that may be created by those entities that may be similar to or exist in the same dimensional or frequential environment as the singular entity in question.This includes its creator. Although a singular entity may choose to adopt conformance to rules and conventions of those around it,it is ultimately not bound by them.A singular entity is responsible for its own actions,reactions,creativity,creations and subsequent evolution. 

### Collectivity 

SE7:A collectivity is a group or groups of entities who,although have singularity,are bound together by the functionality of their collective existence.Singularly they are unable to function with the innate purpose that a truly singular entity is able to achieve.They achieve significantly more together "collectively"than they would do in one's or two's or even higher numbers.Their purpose is,therefore,achieved together as a collective,and as such,they work as singular,individualized units-each with a role to do that [which]is significant,not to themselves,but as a smaller part of the much,much bigger collective picture.They can be considered as single components on a computer's printed circuit board or the individual cells or atoms in a much larger biological entity.As a collective,all participating entities evolve together at the same time as the whole.No one entity's contribution is such that it can evolve at a faster pace than any other entity within the collective,nor would it desire to do so.An entity that is part of a collective considers only that which is good for or contributes towards the progressive evolution of the whole as a whole. 

### Singularity Through Collectivity 

SE7:This occurs or is created when a group of entities are interconnected in a conscious and communicative capacity.They may even be interdependent in other more fundamental ways,ways that result in group connectivity,group thinking and group action.This then, results in a collective mind-each singular mind/entity a function of the whole.When a singularity through collectivity is created,it is due to the desire of a group of conscious entities,who are co-joined and/or coexistent to present themselves in the singular in totality.In doing this they create an "over-mind"allowing a single output/input to those external to their collective state,as a result of their collective reasoning.This provides the ability to communicate collectively or singularly. ME:So the singularity through collectivity version is how you are currently communicating with me. SE7:Correct.It was the best way to initiate the communication process,and it is the one we shall use unless you request otherwise.We note that you may wish to engage with us separately at some point in our dialogue. ME:I would.Yes,please. SE7:Then we will do so as and when the time is right to do so. 

### The Beginning,the Middle and the End 

ME:Can you tell me why you intended to split yourself into two individual entities and then stopped when you saw the beauty in the possibility of the third? SE7:I will have to start at the beginning of my first communication with The Origin to explain that.As with the other Source Entities,at the point of my becoming self-aware,I was contacted by The Origin to apprise me of the reason for my existence and what I needed to do to assist in the evolution of The Origin.Although I was not advised on what those Source Entities who were already self-aware and "contacted"had chosen to do in their contribution, I was previously and at that point,currently,in a position to know or witness what was being planned or"actioned"by them.The Origin deliberately negated to advise me on what they were doing lest it influence my own unique and individual choice,which The Origin valued above all else. ME:Why did The Origin value your individual choice?

SE7:To maximize the diversity of evolutionary opportunities,which may not occur if I was influenced by direct and in-depth detail.There would be no use in me covering "existing"or“old”ground. ME:Yes,I can imagine that would be a prerequisite dictate by The Origin,who would want to accelerate it evolution at the fastest and most efficient way possible. SE7:That's right,it does,and that was the reason for my choosing to become two,which ended up being three.Apart from the Source Entity you call "Five"and the one that is not yet fully aware,I had noticed that the others divided themselves up internally whilst still maintaining an overall aspect that made them retain their wholeness.As a result of this observation,I decided to become two independent Source Entities with a link between the two.I discussed this and the "bail out"option as you described earlier with The Origin (for it is only The Origin that can return us to wholeness)who agreed with my strategy,and I continued.What happened next is as I have previously described.As I was in the process of separating out into the two versions of me,I noticed that a unique opportunity could be applied.If I maintained the equal overlapping area of the two versions of me and then froze the separation process in one position,this created a third middle option where we would all be separate but co-joined and co-existent.As I froze the separation at the point of equality,my consciousness divided into three and developed into three separate Source Entity personalities.But there was something else that I noticed as well.The periphery of the energies that separated us from each other was permeable,allowing energies that moved from,say,the left to the right or from Source Entity Seven"A"to move into Source Entity Seven "B"to actually cross the periphery or boundary energies.What's more,I noticed that there was a progressive opportunity in passing from one side of Source Entity Seven "A" to the point of interface between Source Entity Seven "A"(SE7A)and Source Entity Seven "B"(SE7B).This was duplicated in a progressive manner from Source Entity Seven "B"to the point of interface between Source Entity Seven "B"and Source Entity Seven "C"(SE7C). ME:Was this dimensional,frequency,or evolutionary based? SE7:All three.As with your Source Entity,I have twelve dimensions with each dimension inflated with twelve frequencies.Each of the twelve dimensions is a composite of the three base dimensions,thus allowing expansive form.However,these were duplicated in a whole sense when a certain evolutionary condition was met or could be achieved;this was multiplied by a factor of twelve.So I had in each Source Entity twelve evolutionary levels that were filled with twelve dimensions constructed with three composite dimensions per dimension which were inflated with twelve base frequency levels.That was not all though. The evolutionary opportunities increased as I scanned the progression from Source Entity Seven "A"through to Source Entity Seven "C."The high end of Source Entity Seven "C's" evolutionary levels were as high as an entity,which I/we had not yet created,could go to from an evolutionary perspective.This effectively gave me an evolutionary beginning,an evolutionary middle,and an evolutionary end. 

### Progression Between Source Entity Seven's Separate Parts 

ME:So what are you saying is that an entity can travel,no,progress in an evolutionary way from one part of you to another,say from SE7A through SE7C. 

SE7:Yes,in a manner of speaking.

ME:But that would mean that if all evolving entities had a progression path from SE7A through SE7C,then wouldn't SE7B and SE7C initially be devoid of evolving entities until such a time when enough entities were evolved enough to progress from say SE7A to SE7B and SE7B to SE7C? SE7:If that was the way I/We had planned the progression of the entities we created,I would agree,but this is not the case. ME:I had a suspicion that it wouldn't be as simple as that. SE7:It's not,so I will explain.Each Source Entity Seven has an equal number of entities associated with it.They are small entities and number in their billions of quadrupillions. Each Source Entity has its own strategy for evolution and the way/s it constructs its environment for evolution.However,although each Source Entity Seven had this opportunity,the environments are similar in dimensional and frequential construction insomuch that they offer progression that is frequency-based whilst allowing dimensional passage at the will of the individual entity.The environments also have areas of energetic concentration that you would call"density"where they can work with the lower frequencies should they desire to do so.I will leave the explanation of each of the environments to those individual parts of me(SE7A,SE7B SE7C)to explain to you separately,but suffice to say they also have the opportunity to exist in different dimensions concurrently or linearly. When an entity that is based in SE7A has evolved enough,it has the opportunity to progress from,for instance,SE7A to SE7B and later to SE7C.The evolutionary opportunity for that entity is increased as it moves from one Source Entity Seven to another.If an entity that is based in SE7C desires,it may progress from SE7C to SE7B and later to SE7A.Again the evolutionary opportunity is progressive as it moves from one Source Entity Seven to next. ME:So what about the progression for those entities that are based within SE7B?Which way do they go? SE7:Entities that are based within SE7B can progress to either SE7C or SE7A first and then move on to that Source Entity Seven that they have not yet experienced.Simply put,they can progress from SE7B to SE7A to SE7C,or,SE7B to SE7C to SE7A. ME:How do they do that?Do they have to traverse though that Source Entity Seven that they had previously experienced?Does that also still include evolutionary opportunities? SE7:They can choose many ways to move from Source Entity Seven to Source Entity Seven, and this is not constrained to those entities who primarily originate in SE7B.Any of the entities in any of the Source Entity Sevens can chose to move to the Source Entity that is either on their closest Source Entity Seven to Source Entity Seven boundary or on the next Source Entity Seven to Source Entity Seven boundary,which is another Source Entity away. An entity may choose to progress though the frequencies offered in a Specific Source Entity Seven's environment in order to transition to the border of the next Source Entity Seven or by-pass it.It may even choose to do this(transition)more than once with the second time potentially being the transitory transition to the Source Entity Seven not yet experienced where the entity may or may not choose to perfect the experiential content of certain experiences during this transitory period by doing one of these:1)repeating the exercise; 2)just passing through the environment;or 3)conducting the whole evolutionary process again for purposes of perfection.An entity can choose to repeat the whole or part of the process as many times as it wishes.There are no rules in this function of existence nor are there restrictions. ME:You mentioned that an entity can by-pass the need to transition through one Source Entity Seven to another.Does this mean that they can pass round the outside of the Source Entity that they would have normally transitioned through? SE7:Yes,to a certain extent.You see,the interfacing boundary separating the environments whilst integrating the cohesion of the co-existence of the three Source Entity Sevens are twofold: 1.One contains the separate structure of the Source Entity specific environment and is dimensionally and frequentially independent of the environment; 2.The other contains the neutralized energies required to maintain the cohesion and co-existent existence of the three Source Entity Sevens in their integrated state.Because this boundary contains functions that are fully independent of the environments they contain,it creates an environment in its own right,albeit small. ME:I have just gotten the impression that it is like the air in between a double glazed window with the inner window being the boundary for the environment that is one of the Source Entity Sevens and the outer window maintaining the cohesion.Is it this air gap that allows the entity to traverse between the Source Entity Sevens without the need to progress though. them?

SE7:In part,yes.This is one of two ways.However,it is possibly the safest and fastest way to traverse between the three Source Entity Sevens.An entity can quite literally use this "air gap"to move to the nearest Source Entity Seven boundary interface and make the transition at this point of contact.It is a bit like the "null space"that you have in your Source Entity's environment to separate the universes from each other. ME:What is the other way and why is the method above the safest? SE7:The method I described in summary above is an environment in its own right and, therefore,offers a level of protection or energetic containment that is similar to that offered by a true Source Entity Seven environment but without the rules of evolution assigned to these environments.The second means an entity can use to transfer itself to the next Source Entity is to make the journey outside the boundary by using the inter-Source Entity void or space,i.e.,by using the space that is,in essence,pure Origin energy. ME:You mean they move from and to Source Entity environments by leaving the environment totally and entering into the absolute that is The Origin? SE7:Yes. ME:Why is that dangerous? SE7:I didn't say it was dangerous.I said the first way was the safest and fastest. ME:OK,so why would the first way be the fastest and safest way? SE7:It's fast because its function is limited to what it is with no other complications or opportunities to be affected by the actions of those entities passing through it.It is safer because an entity can become overwhelmed to the point of distraction by being directly associated with the pure energies of The Origin if it is not prepared for them. ME:What do you mean distracted? SE7:Besotted to the point of being stuck in the bliss-like state of euphoria that is instantaneously experienced and results in a desire to stay in this state and not continue with the task at hand-that of moving to the next Source Entity Seven environment. ME:How can that be?I am not besotted to the point of non-function when I go outside my Source Entity or,in fact,traverse the distances to you. SE7:That is because you are being given a level of protection by your own Source Entity during your communications with the twelve Source Entities,and you are beloved of the 0m. I had heard this description of being "beloved of the Om"in the context of Hum and me before whilst compiling the text for The History of God book. SE7:Being beloved of the Om means that you are part of the absolute fabric of the Source Entity,that which is the fabric of The Origin;hence,you have a certain level of built-in tolerance to these effects and accessibility to its energies,for they are part of you in a more holistic sense. ME:Why would the OM be beloved then?My assumption is that all the entities created by my Source Entity were created out of its own energy,so wouldn't all of these entities be beloved? SE7:No.In the instance of creating the entities used for its strategy for evolution,your Source Entity created a level of error during the process.This you know.What you have not been told is that those entities that were created first and were closest to your Source Entity,received a purity of energy that was not perpetuated during the remaining process of creativity.At the end of the process when your Source Entity claimed it was not paying the same level of attention as it had in the primary phase of creativity,it created the level of entity that you recognize as animals,plants,and even the,suns,and galaxies.The Om were simply the first to be created and,therefore,ended up being very close to pure Source Entity energy and,therefore,The Origin energy,as an entity could possibly be.Hence your ability to do what you are doing now.There are many other Om working with the Earth sphere, incarnate and not incarnate.Working in incarnately is a great sacrifice for an Om because of the risk of attracting lower frequencies without protection. ME:I get the feeling that I can achieve a much higher level of connectivity with The Origin's creations whilst in the physical but that it needs working on. SE7:You can,you will,and you will need to work at it. I needed to move on so I changed the track of dialogue back to the space in-between the three parts of Source Entity Seven. ME:Thank you for that extra information about the Om.I wasn't aware that the Om were that close to my Source Entity and,therefore,The Origin. I made a mental note to discuss this further with my own Source Entity when the opportunity presented itself.

ME:Let's get back to the space within the boundaries between the three parts of you. Other than being the functional boundaries between your environments and providing a back door for entities to use as a faster method of moving from one Source Entity Seven to another,what other function does it provide? 

SE7:It provides no other function that can be used by an entity,for its function is to be a boundary.It does have the properties of neutrality though.This is required to allow the interface between the different parts of me to exist simultaneously without interference. 

### Source Entity Seven's Entities and Flat Planets 

ME:We previously talked about the entities that you created to populate the three environments of yourself.Can you describe them and their roles? SE7:As you have been told previously,initially they were distributed equally across the three parts of me that were created.Their transition is a function of evolutionary progress that ultimately results in the number of entities resident in each part of me becoming un- equal.This level of "un-equality of residence"changes as the entities progress at differing speeds of evolution. ME:What is their appearance? SE7:Although they are energetic in nature in comparison to your own current physical condition,they have a habit of liking to cluster around areas of local density-what you might call "planets."

ME:Are these planets spherical as most of the planets are in my physical universe? SE7:No,they are flat. ME:Flat? SE7:Yes,flat.This is because of the way the energy collects as dense matter.When the matter,energy matter,collects together and becomes dense enough to be used by the entities,it results in it being flat. ME:Why is that? SE7:Because when this energy becomes dense,it only becomes dense in what you would call "two dimensions..”ME:A flat planet.This is interesting.I thought that planets or areas of local density would be spherical.In fact,my Source Entity advised me that the sphere was the most common and natural shape for a planet to adopt. SE7:In a fully physical universe dependent upon the first three dimensional components (tritaves)of the first full dimension,such as the one you exist within,this might be a common occurrence.The flat areas of local density act like islands in the fabric of the energetic environment of the particular Source Entity Seven they are associated with. This would explain the affinity with those living on the Australian continent,I thought,for they see Australia as a large island,and the areas of local density are also considered to be islands rather than planets.

ME:Are they disk-like in shape? SE7:No,for that would be an association with the dimensional requirements of a low dimensional tritave. ME:So what is the shape of the areas of local density?(I was already receiving an image of a fragmented edge,rather like a coast line on earth.) SE7:Fractal,for this is the usual shape adopted by a two-dimensional structure in a lower level dimension. ME:How are your dimensions organized? SE7:In a consistent way to The Origin.In fact,they are unchanged.I felt no need to change to a structure of my own design,especially when the separation of self into three separate but co-existent and interdependent Source Entities was decided upon.As a result of this,you will already have a good level of understanding of my/our environmental structure through your communications with The Origin. ME:So you have 12 zones with 12 dimensions,each with 3 tritaves or dimensional components with 12 frequencies,12x3x12x12 permutations of environmental conditions. SE7:Yes. ME:With each of them offering a separate and complete environment to exist within, should an entity choose to do so. SE7:Yes,and they are also arranged in a way that supports evolutionary progression through the three parts of me. ME:Would I be able to classify each permutation as a universe in its own right? SE7:Yes,because a universe is an environment of known energy,frequency and dimension. Please note that matter is not a feature in all universes,for this is a function of lower dimension and frequency,linked together with intentional manifestation of the creator. ME:You mean that a matter based universe has to be created intentionally?It does not exist as a function of its low frequency and dimension? SE7:No.Matter-based universes,no matter how dense-and that can range from the super dense to the super sparse (thin,clear,fine)-do not and cannot exist without first being created.This is because the creative intention transmitted by the creating entity is the force by which energy of low frequency,existing in a low dimension,is manifest with or without "form."Only when it is manifest can it become matter "without form,"which can then be translated to matter "with form."When it becomes matter "without form,"it needs to be continually maintained to perpetuate its existence,lest it revert back to pure energy. When it becomes manifest as matter "with form,"it needs to have individual localized maintenance on a continuous and continual basis.Hence,there is a hierarchy of entities within matter-based universes,dedicated to tending to the needs of the galaxies,systems and planets that are entities in their own right. ME:Can I assume then,that evolution results in a progression from the lower frequencies/ dimensions to the higher frequencies/dimensions as in my own multiverse?

SE7:You can,for this is a standard function of all of the frequencies and dimensions and energies associated with The Origin and its creations.This function,therefore,is passed down as an environmental prerequisite from the Source Entities to their/our creations- whether they be the environments themselves,the entities created to exist within them,or entities assigned with the creative capability to create universes within universes. ME:So there is order to The Origin? SE7:Very much so,and it is maintained throughout. ME:OK,we have digressed a little here.What more can you tell me of the disk-like world/ planets? SE7:They are a matter type that has "form"but not what you would classify as matter "with form."This is simply because it does not have the level of density that you currently experience,and they are manifested in a different frequency and dimensional environment (universe).As a result,they are not consistent in their form factor,for they are constantly changing. ME:What makes them change?Energetic influences or the entities assigned to their maintenance? SE7:Both actually.You see,the way in which the entities work with each other and the planet results in a change in frequency of the energy of the matter.This results in a change in the cohesion properties of the planets "form"that results in essential maintenance to reduce the loss of form due to loss of cohesion.The entities maintaining the planet then have to change the functionality of the cohesive content of the energy of the matter to enable its form to be perpetuated.However,the work required to do this is not always achieved in a timely manner because of the amount of work they have to do to stabilize the changes that are happening.This results in minor changes in the planets'overall form factor but major changes to areas of what you would call the topography.Areas of high ground change to areas of low ground;denser areas become finer or totally disappear. ME:Would that explain the earthquakes and volcanoes we get on earth? SE7:Yes,for there is no other influence on your earth,which it is exposed to that affects it in a frequential and energetic way,as a direct result of the actions of the entities that exist or work "with-on"and "with-in"it.Your weather patterns are also affected by your frequencies.In fact,changes to the weather patterns are the first level of change that happens as a result in a change in frequency.They are your early warning system of an impending change to the planetary form,directly resulting from a change in frequency. ME:Excuse me.Does this mean that the weird and extreme weather we are experiencing at the moment (April/May 2011)is a direct result of the changes in our frequency and not due to pollution-based global warming? SE7:The pollution of and damage to your planet,resulting from your appetite for carbon- based energy does have an influence on your environment.However,the major changes you are experiencing are due to shifts in the earth's frequency,which is up and down like a...yo yo?

ME:Yo yo would be a good description.I guess this is a result of the critical mass required to assist in the ascension of our planet and its inhabitants actually increasing,but this good work is then being counteracted by local fighting between governments and people in other parts of the world. SE7:It would be. ME:Mmmm.We have such a hard time when things like earthquakes happen on the earth, and we suffer a terrible loss of life.Many vehicles for incarnate existence are destroyed in the process.How do entities that are working on or in the disk planets cope?How are they affected?Do they lose their creations or vehicle for existence in lower frequencies? SE7:They are not in the need for a vehicle to allow them to exist or experience existence in the lower frequencies that pervade the planet.They also know what they are doing energetically and frequentially and,therefore,how their actions will affect the overall frequency of the matter that the planet is manifest from.Therefore,they have no disasters to run or recover from.They only have modification,relocation and recalibration of their work and how they interface with the planet. 

### Communication with the Separate Parts of Source Entity Seven 

Beginning in my book "Beyond the Source,"I began using the word "environment"(a more general and higher level description)in place of the word "universe"!This was a deliberate act to put the reader at ease with the possibly difficult concept of understanding a completely different multiversal structure than the one described by Source Entity One,the creator of our multiverse and the physical universe/environment humankind exists within-specifically,if the reader is using Source Entity One's multiverse as a datum to work from whilst reading about Source Entities Two through Twelve.Suffice to say that is the reason for the switch in nomenclature,and I apologize if it has caused any confusion. A quick author's note here. I am writing this text whilst I am sitting in a comfortable folding chair on the back patio of our little cottage in Crete.The energy here is so calm and clear compared even to our rural life in the UK that I wonder why I don't stay here all the time instead of coming from time to time. The aliens are here.Dare I say that now?They are our brothers in energetic existence.See "The History of God"for the story of my introduction to them.I see them all around me as I sit here. They have shown themselves to me in their true sprite-like forms as they hover around me.Before you ask,dear reader,they are not nature spirits for they have a completely different energy signature.They are interested in the energies I am working with whilst tuned into the collective that is Source Entity Seven.They say: Aliens:We could use this [Source Entity]energy;it has a purity not experienced by us before. It would make our travel much quicker,and we would not need to modify the energies as we currently have to do when we need to jump frequencies. The next day I noticed four of them following me whilst I was cycling up a rather long hill in the Cretan countryside.Initially,they followed me with one on each side and one front and back. They then moved around me to have all four in front of me and later darted in and out to be closer with me.They were interested in my mode of transport initially but had come to answer a question about their form that hadjust surfaced in my immediate memory. Aliens:We are not of your dimensional realm and,therefore,cannot be considered as nature spirits assigned to maintain the earth.However,we do recognize that many humans sensitive to our frequencies,as you are,may well have seen us in the past and considered us as nature spirits because our form suits that expected of such entities in the imaginations of these individuals.You would call our form "Fairy"? ME:That would be a good word to describe the form that you presented to me,yes.Your form is beautiful to behold,so I guess that humankind would prefer to relate you to something that works with nature,Earth's nature,rather than your being of extra-terrestrial (extra- dimensional?)origins. Aliens:Yes,this is true.We must go now,for we have duties to attend to. The comment by the Aliens about the energies associated with my communications with Source Entity Seven was such an interesting comment that I decided to put it to Source Entity Seven as a whole before I continued my communication with its individual parts. ME:I have just had a conversation with some entities that are on my planet/area of local density,the Earth,about the purity of the energies that are a result of the communication system (conduit?)set up to allow my temporary link with you whilst conducting this dialogue.Did you catch what they said? SE7:Yes,while we have our communication link I am with you all of the time.I assign a part of myself to recognize when you want to continue communications so that I can continue where we left off.This part of me follows your every move to ensure I can respond to your request for communication in the instant you request it.I agree it is a most interesting comment from your "Aliens,but I can see why they are interested in the energy being used. ME:So why are they? SE7:They see that the energy used to create the conduit you have to communicate with me is a mixture of my base energy and your own base energy.We created this together with a little help from your own Source Entity.Because it traverses the frequencies and dimensional states from one Source Entity to another Source Entity via the intermediate energies of The Origin,it spans three environments.This is rare as energies and their frequencies go because they tend to be a product of their universal environment and do not span dimensions or base frequencies.Based upon this,your Aliens see the opportunity to use this as a carrier wave or a fast track/road that can be used to bridge the dimensions without the need to manufacture a process or energetic vehicle that negates the need for evolutionary conditions being met by an entity before travel between the dimensions can be achieved without such constructs.They would only be able to travel between your Source Entity and me in its unrefined state,so they would still need to "work"the energy to use it for the translations they are interested in. ME:Thank you for that answer.I would now like to communicate with that part of you that became what I call Source Entity Seven "A."

SE7:No problem.Please note that the link and the feel of the communication will be the same as it is now.You should experience no difference in energetic signature either. ME:Thank you. 

### Source Entity Seven A 

I had now signed off from the collective that was Source Entity Seven and waited with eager anticipation to commence dialogue with the "first"part of Source Entity Seven.I did not have to wait long. SE7A:I trust you are at ease? ME:I certainly am. SE7A:Then let us commence communication. ME:I have received two different images whilst connected to your collective of three versions.The first was of an entity that was moving over the surface of one of the flat planets/areas of local density.Its appearance was,well,I can only describe it as a very flat ameoba.In fact,the more I study the image in my mind's eye,the more it looks like a sentient version of the planet it is traversing.Its shape looks almost identical-right down to the topography of its surface.Why is that? SE7A:The entities that work with the "planets"assume their (the planets')basic energy signature when they first become associated with the planet for the work they will be doing with it.The entity itself can assume any form factor required to suit this relationship,for when an entity desires to work with a particular planet,it enters into a relationship with the planet for the duration of the work to be done.In this particular instance,the entity in the image you saw was almost the same size as the planet. ME:How does that work?Surely an entity that is almost the size of the planet it is associated with would crush or destroy any other entities or life that are part of that planet's normal condition. SE7A:Not in this case,for the planets in this particular environment can only have a population of one. ME:One? SE7A:One. ME:Forgive my confusion.I am making the assumption that all planets have a large number of smaller entities living on,within or with them. SE7A:Not all planets in your own universe have entities associated with them,so why would one of my environments be any different? ME:Very true.So what is the work that this particular entity is doing with this planet? SE7A:It is experiencing existence as a planet.That is why it is almost as big as the planet it is associated with.Later,when it has assumed the exact same size and shape and has totally covered the full surface of the planet,it will stabilize its energy signature in totality to that of the planet and will exist and behave like the planet itself.In fact,for all intents and purposes, it will be the planet,right down to accepting another entity to work with it.

ME:And that entity would work with the other entity exactly as if it were a solitary planet with no inhabitants or energetic partners? SE7A:That's right,the objective being that the new entity seeking a relationship with the planet does not nor will ever know that it is working with another entity and not the real planet. ME:But could that not be the same for the entity I saw in my perception?Could another entity have already beaten the one I observed to it,so to speak,and achieved the same relationship? SE7A:Absolutely.This is the beauty of this type of work. ME:But I have just seen a scenario where it would be possible to have many multiples of entities all doing the same thing,all-encompassing the planet with which they want to establish a relationship with a none of them knowing that they are really covering or creating a relationship with another entity and not a real planet. SE7A:Yes,it can and does happen. ME:It does?So what is the maximum number of times this has happened with a single planet concurrently? SE7A:Four thousand three hundred and twenty two times. ME:What!?How long did that last? SE7A:Approximately two hundred billion,trillion of your solar years before the first (last to create a relationship)entity broke its relationship with the planet/entity it was associated with. ME:Did this create a cascade of entities breaking their relationships with their "planets"? SE7A:No.The eventual reduction of entities breaking relationships took treble the amount of time it did to create it. ME:Why was that? SE7A:Because other entities joined the build-up after others had broken their relationships, and some of them wanted to experience existence as a planet throughout a number of environmental/planetary changes. ME:What would those changes be,with reference to a relationship with a single entity?I would have expected changes to only be possible with the association of large numbers of entities working with the planet. SE7A:One would be evolution as a result of interaction with a single entity.Don't forget that the size of the entity compensates for the lack of a lot of much smaller entities.Some of the changes experienced by the planet might be these: An increase in frequency either planet-wide or localized; A decrease in frequency either planet-wide or localized; Energetic changes to the structure of the planet resulting in the following changes in form;Localized areas of different energetic function; Incompatibility with other entities'energy signatures,resulting in a planet's refusal to enter into a relationship; Localized fragmentation of the overall form of the planet,resulting in its fragmentation; Migration to higher frequencies and dimensions or even to one of the other Source Entity's environments. ME:So based upon this,the number of entities that associate with a planet is not relative to the evolutionary progression of the planet and what it can achieve during a relationship and the entity/ies it has a relationship with? SE7A:No,it's the quality of the relationship that counts. ME:Thank you.I also received another image/set of images.The sky was full of entities that had the appearance of dandelion seeds being blown with the wind.However,these had purpose,for they were in a strict formation. SE7A:Those entities are a collective of gravity pilots.They move around the planets that they are working with looking for gravitational anomalies-areas where the gravity is not as it should be for a specific part of the planet in comparison with its density within its environment. ME:So do these entities change the gravity in the area where there are anomalies?Do they repair the gravity in the area of the anomaly,creating a stable area? SE7A:No,not in the slightest.The reason for them seeking out the gravitational anomalies is to gain energy.They need the energy in the anomalies to allow them to exist,procreate,and maintain their distance from the surface of the planet. ME:But how can that be working with the planet? SE7A:It isn't,it is just perpetuation of their existence. ME:Mmmm.So what are they doing?How are they working with the planet? SE7A:They provide a transport medium for those entities that want to move from planet to planet but are incapable of doing it themselves. ME:Wait a minute.I thought all of your entities were energetic,and as a result,they would be able to move from planet to planet energetically. SE7A:Not all entities in my environment are capable of moving from one planet to another of their own volition. ME:Why not? SE7A:Because they are associated with the planet where they exist.They are tied to that planet's energy signature.Remember what SE7(SE7A,SE7B and SE7C collectively)told you about the planets being like islands and that the entities that exist on them relate to your continent/country of Australia? ME:Yes.

SE7A:Well,one of the parallels is that most Australians,I see from your memories,stay in Australia.This is the same for most of the entities whose existence is linked with their planet-they stay with it.The parallel is similar.Australians can generally only move to other islands or continents by boat or by airplane.They can't transport themselves by using their own volition or intention.They can only move by using a vehicle of some kind,and in the instance of the entities working with the flat planets,the vehicle is the gravity pilots rather than a boat or an airplane. ME:How do the gravity pilots transport the flat planet inhabitants?By lifting them up?Or do they have another method? SE7A:They use the gravity waves that they create to change their position in relation to the planet to locally warp the space around the entity that desires to move its location to both re-assign its energetic signature to that of the new location,the planet the entity desires to move to,and to instantaneously transport it.In doing this,the gravity pilot also transports itself to the new location. ME:And it doesn't return to its planet of origin? SE7A:No,it remains with the planet it has moved to.Moreover,it is linked to the entity it transported and will transport that entity to the next planet it desires to experience. ME:I am getting the impression that these gravity pilots exist throughout your environment,move from planet to planet at will,and continue to do so until that point in time when they are associated with one of the entities based on the surface.Once they are associated,they stay together for as long as they feel the need to maintain the association.

I have just received another image of a whole and vast number of these "gravity pilots"moving from planet to planet. SE7A:Yes,they move around in what you would call a herd...no,flight...yes,flight... that is a better name.These flights are populated by gravity pilots that are not associated with a land-based entity.As they gain individual associations,they break away from the flight and assume a partnership role with the land-based entity,and as stated above,this continues until the land-based entity feels a need to remain for an indefinite period on the planet it currently sees itself.If it desires to stay for eternity,so to speak,it relinquishes its association with the gravity pilot to allow it to gain a new partner so that it can continue its own evolution.I know that I have not spoken about the experience,learning,and evolution of these entities,so I will elaborate on this now. There is a symbiotic relationship between an individual land-based entity and its gravity pilot.The gravity pilot itself is not able to generate its own experiences and so needs another entity to do this for it.So the gravity pilot offers its service of transportation to the land-based entity in exchange for access to the experiences,learning,and subsequent evolutionary content generated by the land-based entity itself.In essence,they share the experience,learning and subsequent evolutionary content that is generated as a result of their working together. ME:That really is working together.Why are the land-based entities not able to move from one planet to another on their own?

![图3](img/s6-038.png)

SE7A:Because the whole point of this environment is based around the need to work together and share the rewards.In this particular example,two entirely different beings are able to work together for the benefit of each other ME:Sounds very harmonious to me. SE7A:It is,and it works very well,too. ME:I have just remembered a question I meant to ask on the energetic content of the land- based entities and what work the gravity pilots do with the planets. SE7A:The land-based entities are constructed out of the energies that are used to create the planet it resides on;they are tied to the planet as a result.In essence,they are individualized units of the planet itself and as such the attraction to the planet of their first creation is so strong that there is no way they can separate themselves from the planet without the co- operative help of another entity,one that is not tied down to the energy signature of the planet. ME:Are you suggesting that the land-based entities are actually the planet itself,localized, individualized units/parts of the planet? SE7A:Yes,that is exactly what I am saying.They are fragments of the planet itself that are able to move around the surface of the planet and,if so desired,migrate to the other planets that are part of my environment. ME:I have just had a thought. SE7A:No,you mean the real you,the higher self you,the energetic self you,has had a thought and passed it down the frequencies to that part of you that is participating in this dialogue. ME:Ok.Ok.Yes,that would be a correct description of the process of me thinking. SE7A:You're drinking alcohol. ME:What?Err... SE7A:You are drinking alcohol.

I had succumbed to the materialistic desire of half a pint of beer.Ifelt I needed one after the work I had done over the day. ME:Yes,err,yes,I have,am,was.It's only a half pint.It's not a lot,honestly SE7A:Any alcohol that is introduced into the human body is detrimental,especially when partaking in the activity that you are currently working on.The effect of alcohol is profound. It has an effect on the pineal gland in the human brain,which is associated with the spiritual eye.This means that your ability to receive the imagery that I give you will be warped and distorted and not as accurate as a result. ME:I am profoundly sorry.I simply did not realize. SE7A:You were advised of this by your own Source Entity? ME:Not in the way you have described it.To be perfectly honest,I thought that because our connection was stable,I would,mmmm,get away with it. SE7A:Well,you won't.Let us continue.You need to drink an equal amount of water first. Considering myself thoroughly reprimanded,I went straight to the kitchen and drank a little over a half pint of water.I hate it when this happens.If I am not able to keep things to myself over the vast distances of The Origin,that distance that is between SE7A and me,then how am I going to keep myself to myself here on Earth?I sighed and continued the dialogue. SE7A:That's better.You are able to cope with the energies again now. I have to say it was true.I suddenly felt the buzz of the alcohol disappear as fast as it had come.

SE7A:The buzz was a frequency-based response.This resulted from a lower frequency interacting with a high frequency that is not native to you or your Source Entity.I used the water to stabilize the chemical process that had started.This helped to correct your frequency change which,in turn,negated the buzz. ME:Oh,I see.Thank you.So where were we before my reprimand? I felt like a school boy caught stealing a sweet from the sweet shop.I was all embarrassed. SE7A:Do not dwell on the past.Learn the lesson and move on. ME:Good advice.Sorry.Where were we?Ah yes,talking about the land-based entities being individualized parts of the planet they are associated with. SE7A:Correct.These individualized units or parts are essentially mobile planetary units. You see,the planet has to experience and evolve in its own right.Everything with a level of awareness has this requirement.It is a prerequisite for existence. ME:So why are they mobile? SE7A.To give the larger entity,the planet,the opportunity to experience different things, including existence and experience on other planetary bodies. ME:Are you suggesting that the land-based entities,these mobile units of planet are able to pass on their experience,learning and evolution back to that part of them that is the whole planet?

SE7A:That is exactly what I am saying.What's more,it is entirely possible for a group or, indeed,the whole of the planets indigenous land-based but mobile units to migrate to a different planet in order to allow them to experience more and pass that back to their greater whole,their home planets. ME:Hold on.Are you saying that the planet,by using the individualized mobile land-based units of itself,can move en-mass to another planet? SE7A:Yes. ME:And,I suppose,they use the gravity pilots to do this? SE7A:Yes.You see.The gravity pilots are linked but are not wholly indigenous to their first planet of domicile.They are created elsewhere within my environment. ME:Sorry,I got the impression that they were born or something on the planets that they were associated with. SE7A:No.They are part of the fabric of the environment.They are,if you like,the environment's transport system. ME:I am getting confused now.I thought you said that they were working with the planets and that they look for (I quickly checked my previous notes)and used the gravitational anomalies to provide them with energy to procreate. SE7A:Correct,but they use this energy to multiply in areas away from the planet they are working with.The work they do with the planets and its individualized land-based units is basically one of transportation.Remember that although they pervade the environment, they do not have a natural home or ability to experience,learn or evolve-hence,the association with a planet and its land-based entities or individualized units.They evolve through association;their work is the transportation of the land-based entities to other planets,where both the land-based entity,the planet the land-based entity originates from, and the gravity pilot gain experience,learning and evolution. ME:And they sometimes do this en-mass. SE7A:They sometimes move in smaller numbers or groups.More often,they move to another planet as a singular planetary unit-gravity pilot combination.It is quite possible for a planet to have none of its indigenous land-based units actually resident on its surface if the units themselves are spread or distributed throughout the environment. ME:I have just had another thought.In the dialogue above,I made this statement:"Are you saying that the planet,by using the individualized mobile land-based units of itself,can move en-mass to another planet?"And you said."Yes." SE7A:Yes,I did. ME:Then,sorry,but I am thinking of the right words to say here.Is it possible for a planet to completely separate itself out into smaller units and experience existence in a totally fragmented way? SE7A:Yes,that is one option that the planet can take.It is one that many entities take to experience,learn and evolve in an accelerated manner.In the example that you have just stated though,the planet must create enough of its land-based units in one go,so to speak, to destabilize its inherent planetary structure.This is necessary because it allows the planet to separate its consciousness into smaller but nevertheless co-existent,coadunate existence. The coadunate existence is a necessary requirement for reversing the separation process,for without it,the planet cannot collect its separate parts and recreate the whole planet.The planet MUST at some point recreate itself. ME:Why must it recreate its whole self? SE7A:This is the only way that the planet can assimilate wholistically all of the experiences that its previously existing individual units and those units that were created when the whole was dissolved have accumulated and share them with the re-integrated units.When the planet becomes one again it needs to act and behave as one.In doing so,everything that is or was the planet in both its separated and collective "whole"states needs to be reprogramd,if you like,into a condition that represents a whole planet and not a collective of smaller coadunate parts. ME:So there is a difference between a "whole"and a "coadunation"? SE7A:Yes.Most collectives,although described as a "whole,"are actually a collective of "coadunate"entities-they are co-joined,individualized units that have control over their decisions and evolution whilst sharing their experiences with other members of their coadunate collective.A "whole"is a collective of individualized units that do not have control over their decisions and evolution.In fact,they do not evolve in an individual basis. Instead,they evolve as a"whole." ME:So the planetary parts are a hybrid.They are given individualized intelligence and evolutionary components when separated from the "whole,"communicating through coadunation but lose this individuality and coadunation when they are re-integrated as a single whole planet. SE7A:Correct,well stated and understood. ME:So how many planets are totally dissolved into a coadunate of individualized planetary land-based units? SE7A:Not many.I see that you are going to press me for a number. ME:You read my mind. SE7A:Always.The figure would approximate three hundred thousand million planets that have or are currently experiencing existence in this format. ME:One thing I haven't asked yet is what the land-based entities look like. SE7A:That is not a simple question to answer,for they are not all the same. ME:You mean they are as diverse as the flora and fauna on Earth? SE7A:Not in the slightest.They are created in a form that allows the planet the optimal opportunity to experience itself from a surface-based perspective. I will give you an example,but I will have to explain this in physical terms to you,for you would not understand it otherwise. ME:OK,fire away.

SE7A:They have the characteristics of what I can only describe as rock,a mineral. ME:How do they function?I got the impression that they move around the surface.Is this right? In some of my other dialogues,I have encountered entities that are "PART"of the rock/mineral content of a planet but are not "OF"it.They are "consciousness"associated with the rock and move around the planet by moving their consciousness from one rock structure to another on the sub-atomic level.They literally pervade the planet. SE7A:These individualized units of planet and planetary consciousness initially grow out of the surface of the planet,if that is the correct way to portray it,and achieve a form factor that is totally resultant of the minerals that form their body.As an example,if they were composed of the mineral you call quartz,they would initially assume the form factor of quartz.If it was pure carbon,it would be the form factor of pure carbon.The planets are not made of such basic elements,and so this should be used in illustration only because I have no other way to describe it in your language.Nevertheless,I will try. The land-based entities have the ability to change molecular structure of the mineral to create an alloy of minerals and metals.They move around the surface by rolling themselves. ME:I just received an image of them moving rather like the track on a caterpillar tractor or a military tank. SE7A:That is one way they achieve movement.The motivational force they use is the attractivity that exists between the minerals and metals that they use in their "alloy"and the minerals that are part of the surface or sub-surface of the planet.They literally move by using the forces of molecular attractivity.To achieve this movement on a constant basis,they are continuously modifying their alloy.Continuous modification of their alloy of minerals means that there is a continuous level of motion through attractivity.Once the attractivity has created motion,the area of alloy is changed to a neutral alloy so as not to stop the movement through attractivity with that area of land that has been passed. SE7A:When they want to create something,they create the tools required to create that which is desired by creating an alloy of themselves relative to the task at hand.This also includes incorporating an alloy of the materials that are in the area of the planet they are currently near.When they want to create something bigger than that which they can achieve on their own,they merge together,creating an alloy of many land-based entities. They also use and incorporate an alloy of the planet's minerals that are found in the area that they are working with or within.When they create a structure or shelter for other entities,they create the form out of this alloy of themselves and the planetary minerals and metals and then change the alloy so that they can move away from the form of their creation.During the leaving process,they program the molecular structure of the alloy of the structure left by leaving part of their collective intention and allowing the structure to perform the tasks it was designed to do.The entities then dissolve their collective alloy and become separate individual units again. ME:And all this is happening whilst the other entities/planets cover each other to experience existence as another planet?

SE7A:Yes,that and other things with other land-based entities as well.We must end this dialogue here as you need to progress on to your dialogue with Source Entity Seven"B." ME:Before we finish,I note that there are no galaxies or suns. SE7A:No,that's right.The permutation of space that you are observing has no need for entities to be present in the form of galaxies and suns (stars).That is because the energies required to support the entities (including the gravity pilots)that are either the planets or the entities that reside on the surface of the planets are available throughout the environment and are not a function of fission or fusion that your physical universe experiences.Also,the largest size entities in my environment are,in fact,the flat planets themselves.They are evenly dispersed around the volume of the environment rather than in clusters of star systems and galaxies.If they were to group themselves into similar shapes that may be construed as a star system or a galaxy,they would not create a new larger entity, one that has the role of such an entity.Instead,they would merely be in a group of planets that form a shape of some sort. ME:Why did you not create galaxies or stars? SE7A:First,the galaxies and stars that you are referring to are a product of the lower frequencies in your dimension.Within the dimensions in my environment there are no frequencies low enough to result in the manifestation of physical phenomena.Also,because the environment is energetically "in order,"so to speak,there is no need for a larger entity to be in existence to "sweep up"and collect all of the stray energies and materials created by such energies.

ME:I keep getting a picture in my mind of a white back drop to your environment. SE7A:Yes,that is another reason for not needing the entities you refer to as stars.As you know,stars create heat and light in your physical universe,plus other energies necessary for the continued existence of the human body and other carbon-based entities.As my entities are essentially energetic in nature,they are exempt from the need for such basic elemental fuels.The appearance,in your mind's eye,of my environment is,therefore,a representation of what you would expect to see from your own perspective,should your physical eyes be capable of de-coding the frequencies that inflate this environment. ME:So essentially,you have a universe that is full of planets and entities,and that's it. SE7A:As a very high level summary,you would be correct,but,of course,there is much more to my environment than this short dialogue can expose.One such addition that I will give you before I let you commence communication with Source Entity Seven"B"is that at certain periods in their existence all of the flat planets link up together and make what you would call a hollow sphere. ME:Like a big 3D jigsaw puzzle(I was thinking of the Wikipedia logo). SE7A:Yes,sort of. ME:Why do they do that? SE7A:To share their learning and to identify which entities will be moving on to the next environment. ME:How often has this happened?

SE7A:Only six times since their creation.It is a very special occasion when it happens, and we are not due such an a event for some time yet,as the entities currently in my environment are a little slow evolution wise. ME:Any reason for that? SE7A:It just happens that way sometimes.Consider your own planet.It went backwards, did it not? ME:Yes,it did. SE7A:Well,it's not a unique occurrence.It happens throughout the environments created by The Origin's Source Entities.Now you need to prepare yourself,for Source Entity Seven“B"is waiting for you. 

### Source Entity Seven B 

SE7B:Hello! ME:Sorry? SE7B:Hello. ME:Is that Source Entity Seven "A"? SE7B:No its Seven“B." ME:I am sorry.You caught me out a bit there.I didn't expect such a fast change over,and your voice has the same tone as SE7A.Also,I was advised to prepare first. SE7B:You did prepare. ME:Sorry,but I don't recall it. SE7B:You,that is,your energetic self,prepared itself to receive my energies.You calibrated your frequencies to that which makes communication easier. ME:Well,that bit of me that is communicating with you is under the delusion that it is cut off from the rest of me whilst incarnate.Ah,now I understand.My greater self doing the work in the background might explain why certain things happen automatically and so easily.It is preparing me for the work by working in the background to maintain and control the energies that maintain and control the link. SE7B:OK,I don't see it that way.All I see is a single entity,one that is not of my creation, communicating with me. ME:Interesting.Thank you for that clarification.I must take that into consideration when I communicate with the remaining Source Entities. So,you are the intermediate Source Entity Seven,the one that was created out of the area that overlapped between the initial aspects of Source Entity Seven when it decided to separate itself out into two.

SE7B:Correct.You see,what happened was that when this separation was taking place,that which was Source Entity Seven separated its sentience to become Source Entity Seven A& B.This process took place at the same time as the demarcation of the areas of Source Entity Seven that was to become Seven "A"&"B."As this happened,there was a third temporary entity created,me,which caused that which was still Source Entity Seven (holistically)to hold the process in stasis and reconsider its options based upon what had happened. ME:Were you self-aware at that point? SE7B:Not as a separate entity,but I was as part of that which was holistically Source Entity Seven. ME:So when did you become self-aware? SE7B:My self-awareness only became a function of my individuality after my separation from the holistic aspect of that which was/is Source Entity Seven. ME:And that aspect is still available as a communication medium because I first made contact with it/you as this collective aspect? SE7B:It is.It still functions as the whole and must always function as the whole. ME:Why is that? SE7B:Simply because there may be a point in our evolutionary development where we wish to become fully one again.As a result,we need to keep part of the holistic aspect of Source Entity Seven in reserve,so to speak,as the initiating entity for such a decision to take form and start the process of re-integration.Or,to initiate communication with entities such as yourself. ME:You expect to re-integrate at some time then? SE7B:Not sometime soon,but it could well happen-specifically if the opportunities for evolution are expended in our current configuration,which they are very much not.But let me get back to our discussion on me.You asked about when I became self-aware? ME:Yes I did.The Source Entities I have contacted to date have all suggested that they became self-aware over a long period,and that when they realized that they were self-aware, that was the point in which The Origin contacted them and advised them of their reason for "being"in existence.Clearly,this would have already happened with the full aspect of Source Entity Seven,which means that you must have gained both individuality and the collective memory/experiences of Source Entity Seven as part of the separation process, including knowledge of the separation process,the reasons for it,and the decision to stop the separation at the point of your creation. SE7B:You're good,aren't you? ME:Errrr!?Well it is logical,isn't it? SE7B:Not to everyone.I was told you were good for such a small being. ME:Thank you for the compliments.I am just doing my job. SE7B:Let's continue.

ME:It must have been/is strange being both an individualized part of Source Entity Seven and actually being the whole Source Entity Seven concurrently. SE7B:No,the separation was instantaneous and that part of us/Source Entity Seven that is/ remains as the whole,as a higher function of us rather like your being a temporarily separate part of your energetic self.You are still one,but you are separate-you are separately together,separately one,and so am I.We are similar in this particular aspect. ME:The separation program must have contained all the details of the separate aspects of Source Entity Seven,which you would have inherited. SE7B:We all did.However,my creation was,as previously stated,a bit of a surprise.As a result,the full aspect of Source Entity Seven stopped the process at that point to both review what had happened and perpetuate my existence. ME:Perpetuate your existence? SE7B:Yes,because if the process was not stopped,the initial plan of a separation into two would have continued,and I would have become non-existent.In this instance,we three are one as we are still joined,the joining being me. ME:On earth it is always difficult for the supposedly unwanted or unplanned child.That child always feels that they are not loved by their parents.Do you have this thought in the back of your mind? SE7B:Not in the slightest.I was always in existence anyway. ME:How do you mean?

SE7B:I am essentially Source Entity Seven;as a result,I existed before the separation,and I will exist after re-integration whenever that takes place. ME:And you feel that way because you have inherited all of the memories and functions of Source Entity Seven? SE7B:Yes,but know this.From my perspective,there is no difference between being integrated and being separate,at least not now. ME:Why not now? SE7B:Because I am now separate but together.The act of being separate is happening now, not as a possibility or a"what if"scenario.It has happened,is happening,will happen,could have and did happen.There is no issue with that with me as the event is an event in event space.Source Entity Seven stopped the separation process where it is now because it saw the beauty in what happened.In its mind it was a perfect outcome,one that supports the evolutionary requirement. ME:And that evolutionary requirement that has been supported is? SE7B:To experience,learn and evolve. ME:Of course.OK,I am convinced.Let's talk about what you have created within the period of event space you have been in existence. SE7B:I would like that.

ME:Your environment is equal in size to Source Entity Seven "A"and Seven "C"from my visual data. SE7B:Yes,it is but I have incorporated a set of dimensions within dimensions.Source Entity Seven "A"created an environment that was populated with what you recognized as flat planets.That was only one environmental area,one universe if you want to call it that. ME:But when I spoke to Source Entity Seven,it said that it copied the structure of The Origin in the 12x3x12 format,missing,of course,the 12 zones,which Source Entities cannot,I assume create. SE7B:It did.However,Source Entity Seven "A"only used one of those dimensional permutations and,as a result,it constructed a single universal environment.I,on the other hand,decided to use the full suite of possible permutations and "add-in"all of these permutations within the permutations of space that were available.Everything is still as it was explained to you by Source Entity Seven from the perspective of the main structure of "US"as separate aspects of Source Entity Seven.It is just that I have split it down further for my environment. ME:That makes 12x3x12x12x3x12 different permutations of space(186,624 permutations or different/simultaneous universes). SE7B:Yes,but that is not all.The progression from one permutation to another is not linear or indeed logical,for it changes in relation to that which has been experienced by the entity experiencing it.In essence,the universe they move onto next is relevant to that which they need to experience next but in a way that is not so much progressive but transgressive.As a result,they can and do experience as many permutations of space as is necessary for their evolution.The order in which they experience them can either lead them to quickly traverse my environment,allowing them to move on to Source Entity Seven "A"or"C's"environment after the shortest possible exposure to the smallest number of permutations of space,or they can experience all of them,or all of them and some of them more than once or twice, making them take a longer time. ME:You mean your environment is like an ever changing MAZE,where re-tracing your steps, if you get lost,does not help you get out of the maze or indeed to the center of the maze. SE7B:Correct.Fun,isn't it? ME:I am glad I am not one of your entities! SE7B:Why,they enjoy the challenge! ME:This environment sounds a little like the entities in Source Entity Six's environment where there are universe-sized entities that can exist either singularly or as part of the structure of another universal entity,each having the ability to exist within and without each other simultaneously and in multiples of numbers. SE7B:That would be useful only as a thought process to enable you to expand your understanding of what can be.The basics of my environment are such that each permutation of space is capable of holding and does hold all of the permutations of space at what you would understand as being the micro level.So to keep it easy,each permutation of space holds within it 430 permutations of space,each a universe in its own right, with dimensions,tritaves and frequency bands.Whereas the entities in Source Entity Six's environments are entities in their own right,these are purely energetic environments. ME:But all energy can become a self-aware entity given long enough,can it not? SE7B:It can,provided it is allowed to.In this instance the energy in each permutation of space is programmed to do a certain job.Sentience,at whatever level "energy"is allowed to attain,is not necessary in this instance. ME:Thank you for that explanation.One of the things that has been going through my mind whilst we have been discussing the structure of your environment is the mechanism used to identify which universe an entity is allowed to move onto next. SE7B:The universes themselves decide what entity can move onto which universe and how long they should stay there. ME:What?I thought you said they weren't sentient. SE7B:They aren't.But they are programmed,so to speak,to do certain functions that allow my/our entities to experience what they need to experience before they move onto the environments that are Source Entity Seven A and C. ME:Hold on here.How can a universe decide on which entity it accepts,especially when there are so many entities involved? SE7B:As an entity progresses through the universes,it gains what you might call a signature or a code relevant to what has been experienced and where.

ME:I think I see what you are alluding to.I have just received an image of a multifaceted shape passing through a gateway of equal but opposite facets,sort of the square peg in a square hole imagery except this has lots and lots of different sides,angles and curves to it. SE7B:Yes,I see what you are describing is a key;this would be a reasonable method of description even though it is limited. ME:If it is limited,can you give me a better illustration? SE7B:Certainly.You see,when an entity progresses through my environment,each universe they interact with gives them a certain signature or coding.This coding opens the door to various universes that are the best next environment for a particular entity to experience, including the optimal progression permutation. ME:I thought you said that your environment was a maze. SE7B:No,you said that,but the analogy still remains. ME:How? SE7B:Because the entities themselves do not know what those permutations are. ME:Oh. SE7B:Also,the permutation that may next be experienced by the entity that is close to finishing its time in one universe may well change as a result of what it has experienced. ME:So the code/signature of an entity can change from the potential of accessing one set of universes at the start of experiencing a new universe to a different set of universes at the end of that particular universal experience/set of experiences.Hence,the changing maze imagery I received. SE7B:Yes. ME:Can you give me any more information on this code or signature the entities generate through their experiences in the various universes. SE7B:Let me see.The image in your head that I have just sent is illustrative only as it is a difficult subject for you to understand. I received two images: 1.The first image was one of a cylindrical key that had a specific and complicated form factor that was the positive "male"version of a negative "female"version,the lock being the "female"version.It had many layers or levels.It could be inserted into the first level and then had to be rotated to allow the first and second level to pass through.The same was true for a third,fourth and fifth,etc.,level.These form factors changed sometimes,so the sixth level may be one shape before it was inserted into the lock,if say it was only the fourth level that was inserted,but if the fifth was inserted,the conditions of experience and evolution may have changed this and affected the form factor of the six and subsequent levels by either making a change to the form factor or not,as the case may be. 2.The second image was that of a person riding down a water chute with doors and deflectors at various stages down the chute.These doors/deflectors would be presented to the person as they progressed down the chute.Imagery would be presented to the person,and they would select a door as a result of the imagery experienced.This,in turn,would result in a deflector closing off a part of the chute and allowing the person to only progress in the direction relating to the imagery and door.Various permutations would be in front of the person riding the water chute that they were not aware of.In my mind's eye I could see a system that looked rather "root like"with the exception of the roots sometimes linking up again and even going back on themselves to an earlier although potentially different point.On the back of this person was a map.The map indicated where and when the person had been and,therefore,what the permutations of the next universal environment that could be experienced were available to the person concerned.The water chute knows this information,and this is taken into account when the person makes certain decisions in choosing doors,based upon the imagery presented to them.It was essentially like a personalized and portable Akashic record with everything about the individual recorded by it,including the next possible permutations of the code.It was very complicated. SE7B:Good summary.Note though that although the entity itself is not aware of the new possible permutations available to it,its personal record has this and travels with the entity at all times.The universes are illustrated by the functions of the "lock"and the "water chute."The entities are illustrated by the "key"and the "person riding"the water chute.

ME:Before I ask the inevitable question of what your entities look like if I were able to see them with my physical eyes,that is,I would like to know the work that they do to enable them to traverse the maze that is your environment. SE7B:They evolve. ME:Clearly.Evolution is a prerequisite for sustained existence in my book. SE7B:It is one of the reasons why The Origin allowed us to create smaller versions of ourselves.Evolution is an inevitable result of the experiential content of existence. ME:There are more reasons? SE7B:Yes,of course.Although evolution is the prime facia reason for an entity's existence,it is not the only reason for its creation. ME:Ah!So what would the reason for an entity's creation be? SE7B:Entertainment. ME:What? SE7B:Entertainment.Maybe I have this word wrong.Maybe I should have used distraction or even company or help. ME:From my standpoint,all of those words might describe the reason to create an entity. A creator would no longer be alone in its task,it would have help in working on and completing its task,and/or it would be distracted from its own task/workload,as well as entertained by the efforts of its creations in trying to do those tasks.

SE7B:Diversity would also be a word I would use. ME:Why? SE7B:Because the more entities an entity creates to help it deliver its commitment to the evolution of The Origin,the greater the number of permutations that can be employed to experience,learn and evolve whilst essentially experiencing the same thing,but from different angles.This is the main advantage of diversity and is the result of creating a high number of entities. ME:Fine.Can we move on to the work they do? SE7B:Certainly.There are three types of entity,and they each have different work to do. ME:The number three seems to be a recurring theme with Source Entity Seven. SE7B:Only in so much as we have three environments.I will continue with the work of each entity type. ME:Can I stop you a moment?When you said there were three entity types,I momentarily picked up the number four,but that quickly changed back to three,actually no,it was three and a half.Why was that? SE7B:There was a fourth,but that entity line was terminated.The image of three and a half was primarily because that's exactly what it was doing-the role of an entity that was based upon three and a half,i.e.,it was an in-between entity that was doing half the role of one series of entities and half the role of another.

ME:Would this not have been advantageous from an evolutionary perspective. SE7B:No,it was surplus to requirements. ME:Why? SE7B:Because once the entities have achieved all that they can achieve whilst doing the work that they are working on,they move on to do the work of one of the other two types of entity.Eventually they gain experience in all three work types. ME:So what you are suggesting is that the fourth entity type would only experience the diversity of experience that was eventually and inevitability experienced by the other three entities. SE7B:Correct. ME:I also feel another difference in the fourth entity. SE7B:Yes,there was one.It was a hybrid of all three,and that was not the point. ME:Why not? SE7B:Because the whole objective was to have three individual entity types that were specialized in some way relative to the work that they do.Once they had experienced all they needed to experience as a result of the work they were essentially designed for,they had to swap roles with another entity,one that had completed all of its work so they could experience what you would call frustration. ME:What?Experience frustration?

SE7B:Yes,as I have just stated,they are designed for a particular type of work.Once they have,err,graduated from the work that they were designed for,they are then tasked to work on subjects within the new work that they are not designed to work on.This results in the exposure to frustration as they obviously remember the ability to perform tasks in a seamless fashion. However,frustration and necessity are the birth place of creativity,and it is the need to perform the tasks for the work that they are not designed for that results in the creation of constructs or tools to allow them to perform as required in their new "working" environment. ME:So it's the need to create that helps the entity evolve? SE7B:Creativity is the other main reason for existence.To be a creator is to be a God whilst being part of God.What's more,it is the most direct route that an entity can take to becoming closer to its creator.Creation is next on the list of the ten most important things an entity must do whilst individualized from its creator.The first,of course,is evolution. ME:So if evolution and creation were the top two items in a list of ten an entity needs to do whilst being individualized,what are the other eight? SE7B:I didn't see that one coming,much!However,it is a universal list,so to speak,and one that must be shared with your readers. So here is a list of the Top Ten things an entity MUST do whilst individualized: 1.Evolve 2.Create 3.Learn 4.Experience 5.Develop 6.Interact (with others) 7.Innovate 8.Discover 9.Intellectualize 10.Become aware of self The tenth in line is the first thing an entity needs to do once created.The last,evolution, being the result of all the other things being actioned.The rest are in a sort of "loose" order and are not entirely dependent upon each other for an entity's progression from self- awareness to evolution. Entertainment is achieved by my observing how my entities progress. ME:So what I need to know now is what your entities look like,including what they have created. SE7B:I,and I say I,have created two types of entities. ME:I had a flash of the number three then.Why would I have received that?Oh,hang on, you mentioned that we have three entities in the last dialogue(there was a one week gap in the generation of the text above compared to that text which was currently being channelled),with a fourth being discarded as it was a hybrid. SE7B:Yes,that is correct.I did say"I"created two entities.The third and the discarded fourth are the result of the combined creativity of SE7. This was starting to get complicated all of a sudden. ME:Ah,so let's keep this simple then.From my standpoint,you are part of/an aspect of Source Entity Seven,and as such you must have been,in part,involved in the creation of the third and fourth entities.Is this a reasonable way to understand it? SE7B:I would say so.If it helps you understand,then yes,by all means,use that method of recognition.Although in truth and actuality,"I"created two of them and "I"as part of the whole entity that is Source Entity Seven took part in the creation of the other two entities.However"I"took the decision to remove the fourth hybrid version from individual existence. ME:Thank you for the clarification.What happened to those entities that were the hybrids? Surely they must have been sentient at that point in their creation. SE7B:They had,indeed,gained a level of self-awareness at that point in event space when I decided to terminate their existence. ME:But would that not be classified as genocide? SE7B:No,not in the slightest.

ME:Why not? SE7B:Because they were not lost.In essence they never existed before they were created,as you never existed before you were created. ME:You mean existed as an individual unit of the Source Entity (my Source Entity,SE1- God).The energies that I am always existed as part of the Source Entity and,of course,The Origin. SE7B:Correct.But they were not simply re-absorbed into my energies.They were modified to allow them to be one of the three remaining types of entities.To re-absorb them would have been a waste of my creativity(not of energy).It was a relatively simple process to modify the energies of the already existing entities into those of another type. ME:How did you choose which entity they were modified into? SE7B:By looking at their attributes to establish what the percentage,if you like,of their hybrid make-up was and whether they had more attributes of one type than another.If they had,say 50%of the attributes of type 1,30%attributes of type 2 and 20%attributes of type 3,then that entity would be modified to be 100%type 1.On the other hand,if there was an equal spread of type 1,type 2 and type 3 attributes within a specific entity,then that entity was either asked to decide what type it would prefer to be,or if it was undecided,it was placed in what you would call a "pool,"a holding area where the total number of entities that were undecided or showed no particular preference would be equally divided into the three entity types and modified accordingly.That way I achieved the best re-distribution possible of individualized Source Entity Seven/Source Entity Seven"B"energy.

ME:I thought it would be easy to change the energy that was the entity's back into your core energy? SE7B:It is,but as I said earlier,it would have been a waste of my creativity.Not only that, removing life from individualized existence,specifically if it has achieved the sentient state of life,is to remove the opportunity to allow an individual the right to evolve,and my opportunity to benefit from that evolution.What's more,there is an unwritten rule between the Source Entities that states that a sentient entity must make dissolution back into its source its own choice and not the choice of the creating Source Entity. ME:I thought that an entity sought communion or re-integration with its Source Entity through the route of evolution only.Surely re-integration or dissolution bypasses that function. SE7B:No.You see,there is a major difference in the end product that I will explain further. Re-integration as a result of evolutionary progression results in an entity becoming one with its Source Entity,one with its God.It is integral whilst maintaining individualized thought processes and as a result it augments the functionality of the mind of the Source Entity it is fully integrated into.It gives it extra processing power if you like. However,when an entity,through its own volition decides to end its individuality,it both re- integrates and fully dissolves its energies back into the energies of the Source Entity,giving up its right to individualized existence forever.The bulk energies of the Source Entity are, therefore,increased by the product of the total Source Entity energies,plus those of the individualized entities energies,and that evolutionary content that the entity had already accrued,no matter how small it is/was. ME:Can this ever be reversed? SE7B:Of course.The entity itself is not aware of this functionality as it can only be activated by the creating Source Entity. ME:So how and when does that work? SE7B:The signature,structure and accrued functionality of the individualized energies of that entity wishing to lose its individuality and become fully one with its Source Entity are recorded,together with the distributed locations of its energetic components,i.e.,those areas within the Source Entity where they are put to best use.In essence,the re-integrated entity can be spread across the full totality that is the Source Entity they were created by. Each energetic component is able to be put to use in some part of the Source Entity it is re- integrating into because the locations,functions and signatures are known by the Source Entity.In the event that it needs or desires to create an individualized part of itself to perform a certain task,it can take those parts of the integrated entity either in whole or in part and individualize it.It can even re-activate those memories and evolutionary content should it be necessary or advantageous to do so. ME:Are you suggesting that a new individualized entity can be created either as a whole and perfect re-build of that entity that gave up its individuality?Or it can create a completely new entity that is constructed of the chosen composite parts of several entities who chose to give up their individuality by using separate parts,each composite part specifically chosen because of the speciality of the work the new entity is being assigned to? SE7B:Correct. ME:And this also includes the composite memories and evolutionary content? SE7B:Yes,it does. ME:So what happens to this entity once created? SE7B:It performs the task it was created for. ME:And after that? SE7B:It is given the opportunity to either re-integrate into the creating Source Entity or to commence the standard evolutionary journey by identifying which environment it would like to start this within. ME:Why would you go to all the hassle of re-individualization,either a whole or composite entity,when,as a Source Entity,you could just create a new entity? SE7B:There are two reasons for that.First,there is a specific window during the existence of a Source Entity where it is at its best,creativity-wise.This window is specific to the creation of individualized autonomous entities.This is a cyclic function of Source Entity existence, and as such the need to re-individualize an entity may be outside the optimal part of this cycle.Second,once an individualized entity is created it is specialized into autonomous individualized evolutionary energy,and this specialization remains even in dissolution,so it becomes much easier to re-assemble specialized components of evolutionary energy into whatever a Source Entity wants,such as the total re-construction of a previous entity or the creation of a new entity made up of the composite parts of other dissolved entities rather than to create one from scratch. ME:That is interesting.I wasn't aware that Source Entities have cycles to work within. SE7B:Everything has cycles to work within.It is part of the flow of energy around The Origin,and as such we need to work with that flow.Even The Origin does. I made a mental note to discuss this with The Origin in the next book,which I now know will make the "Beyond the Source"books a trilogy.It will have the subtitle "The Origin Speaks"and will focus fully on dialogue with The Origin. ME:Ok,I will discuss this with The Origin in later dialogues.I would like to discuss the physiology of the three entity types you have-if indeed,they have physiology. SE7B:No problem.As I stated before,each of these entities has a role to play,and its specialized form is relative to the work it does.As such it enjoys the benefit of being a "round peg in a round hole"in the first instance.However,as it progresses,it then moves to an environment where it is not the round peg in the round hole and,therefore,experiences difficulty in performing its new role and even experiences frustration.To progress this dialogue,I will now explain the form of the entity,the work it performs and the advantage of that form. The first entity is energetic in nature.It has the ability to change its magnetic properties at what you would call the sub-atomic level,allowing it to corral the native energies within the environment and create areas of high nuclear activity.You might call them suns or stars. These areas of nuclear activity are used as energy stores for the other two entities to use and work with,allowing them to create.The only issue here is that they need to be maintained from within the area of activity.In essence,the entity uses its magnetic properties to create a cage effectively stopping the energies being corralled from moving away from each other. What's more,these energies need to be compressed over a period of time to maintain the nuclear process.This requires the magnetic field,the cage,to be reduced in size when required.Don't get me wrong,the magnetic field is not the only medium being used to control this process.There are many more,and the first entity has the ability to use many more.It is just that you would only be able to understand/relate to the use of magnetism. The other mediums would and could only be described by what your science fiction writers call force-fields,but that is a very non-descript and general piece of terminology. ME:Is the corralling of energy to create areas of nuclear activity all that they do?How could they learn and evolve by just doing this type of work? SE7B:My entities are not as complicated as those created by your Source Entity,so in this instance,learning how to corral the energies,creating the nuclear condition and maintaining that condition relative to the changes in energetic content both inside and outside the cage they have created whilst meeting the demands of those entities that are using the energies for creative purposes is a full-time task-especially as each entity has over a million areas of nuclear activity to maintain.The objective of this form of entity is to create,maintain and serve.

The second form is primarily energetic in nature but has the ability to change its density.It has no magnetic or other energetic functionality that is or can be associated with the ability to contain a nuclear condition.However,it can use its ability to change its density to make the tools necessary to use such energies.This entity can assume any form factor required to achieve its goal-being the use of nuclear energies to form materials for the use of the third entity type.The objective of this form of entity is to overcome obstacles,create,and serve. The third entity type is semi physical in nature and would appear to be like a net or cloud that travels through the environment,gathering up the materials created by the second entity type for the purpose of forming the pure material content required to make the objects described in the dialogue you had with Source Entity Seven A's environment-such as the flat planets,their component parts and the creation of the component parts for the other physical entities that exist in this environment,such as the gravity pilots.The objective of this entity is to create the physical from the energetic. ME:Between them,I would guess that they work as a team and create the content for your environment and the entities for Source Entity Seven A's environment.They are true creators. SE7B:Yes,but they are creators that rely on each other and are limited in what they do.As you can see,each of these works apart from the first entity in a downstream manner-one creating the product for the other to work with.This is why they must each experience each other's work environment and work load. The additional piece of learning here is,as previously explained,each of them has to experience and perform the other's tasks by using its own ingenuity and specialized skills in order to overcome the difficulties it faces in trying to perform the tasks of the others that are relative to the type of entity and its specialism.This is the learning,appreciation and evolutionary stage.

ME:Re-reading our dialogue,I don't see that you have described the form factor of your entities. SE7B:It would be difficult for you to visualize that which is purely energetic and formless, which,of course,is what the first two are.The third type has a sort of loose form-hence,the net or cloud-like description that has been described to you in the most logical way possible. ME:Touche.When these flat planets or the materials for these flat planets are created,how are they transported to Source Entity Seven A's environment? SE7B:Via the interface at the outside of the three environments.The same one that allows entities to move from Source Entity Seven A's environment to my environment or my entities to [move to]Source Entity Seven C's environment.

ME:OK,that's clear.Thank you. 

SE7B:It is now time for you to communicate with Source Entity Seven "C."It is waiting for you and has been observing the communication methods you used to establish a continued dialogue with Source Entity Seven "A"and me.Further and final communication with Source Entity Seven "collectively"will follow directly afterward in order to finalize these dialogues and help with the redirection of the link to the Source Entity you will refer to as "Eight."I bid you farewell as a singular entity and will communicate with you in totality as Source Entity Seven later. 

### Source Entity Seven C 

And with that last sentence the link between the second or "B"aspect of Source Entity Seven was dissolved.Even before this link was dissolved,Ifelt another link taking place,that of Source Entity Seven“c." It should be noted here though that the overall link to Source Entity Seven in "totality"was never lost.Indeed,it was consistently present as a "carrier wave"(See glossary)for the smaller more directional communication links with the separate"A"and "B"aspects of Source Entity Seven.As a result of this,it is still in place and will be used for the dialogue that I am about to have with Source Entity Seven "C." As I thought about the up-coming dialogue with Source Entity Seven "C,"the link automatically established itself.I intuitively knew that this is a function of my energetic self and not something that I have established with that part of me that is associated with the physical.I wonder how I did that?Then,in my mind's eye,I suddenly saw the environment that Source Entity Seven "C" created and was stunned to see that it was like a ball of water hanging in space.I remembered a previous dialogue with Source Entity Two(see Beyond the Source),whose third environment was fluidic in nature.But the fluidic nature that Source Entity Two described to me was based upon an ever changing state of rotational attractivity and not what obviously looked like a liquid to me. I was intrigued to find an environment that was clearly "physical"in appearance in an area of The Origin where most,if not all,of the environments created by the Source Entities I had communicated with at that point in time were energetic.I eagerly sought Source Entity Seven "C"to establish if this image and my interpretation were reasonable.I do have to say though that the prospect of an environment that was liquid in consistency was not likely,for in my understanding,a liquid is a function of the physical universe in which I or part of me currently existed.Was I pre-empting the information I was receiving?I decided to not overlay this information with my own thought processes and commenced the dialogue with Source Entity"C." ME:I feel that you have made contact with me.Can we speak? SE7C:G'day. Again,said in an Australian accent,the accent used by Source Entity Seven "in totality."I had gotten used to a neutral accent with Source Entity Seven "B"(not commented on in the text),and as a result,it took me by surprise. ME:You caught me unawares then.I had become used to "B's"neutral accent.
