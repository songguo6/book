## Foreword 

I am here again,staring at the very empty first page of my next book.This will be the first time I have worked on a book for four months-they have flown by.Having had the break that was promised to me,I now sit here with some trepidation.I learned in the last few pages of The Anne Dialogues and received some level of warning in The Origin Speaks that I needed to write another six books!That this book is the first of these six is the daunting part. Why is it daunting,you may ask,when I have already written six books?The answer is simple.The first books came one by one with no precognition of the books to follow until the very end of the book being finished-that is,apart from the Beyond the Source books.I wasn't seeing the bigger picture.Then,slowly,toward the end of The Origin Speaks,I started to gain an insight into the rest of the work I had to do and over the last eighteen to twenty months I have been given not only the titles for these books,but also an idea of the content. Two books are due to be in a similar"deep"vein to the ones I have written to date,insomuch as they will deal with the Om and provide more information on The Origin.Two are going to be controversial,as they are going to touch and expose information on subjects that are taboo on many levels.They will be "stand alone"and I am told I will write these two last!!! No,I will not be saying what the subject matter is yet,but I am sure that I have spoken to one or two people about them over the last year or so.The last two are also "stand alone" subject-matter-wise but will work on subjects that I have touched on in my previous books; one being this book and another dealing with healing and with how the way we incarnate affects our energies in a dysfunctional way.Deal with them one by one,I hear you say,and I agree with you,but knowing what one has to do and moreover,the time frame that I have to work with,is the daunting part,especially as I know what to expect in terms of the difficult concepts and theories surrounding the subject matter. All this being said,I am looking forward to working on the content of this book-The Curators,the title of which I have only just been given,even though I have known the subtitle for some time.It promises to be interesting,enlightening,educational,fun,and I have no doubt will have a number of areas where we go deep into the detail of the subjects being discussed.I am also expecting to provide a number of illustrations to let you see what I can see while providing links with previous imagery where possible. Again I sit here.Having rambled on a bit,I am not only wondering when I will actually start the first words of text attributable to the title,but I am also wondering who I will be communicating with.As usual,I didn't have to wait long! SE1,O,A:[altogether]Surprise!!! I suddenly felt like the man who came home from a rough day at the office to open the door of his house to find a"“party"waiting for him!! ME:OK,so you are all here.Which of you will I be talking to? SE1:Predominately myself...

O:Although we will all... A:Contribute at some point. I must admit that I didn't expect to feel Anne's energies. A:It is planned that I will make the odd "guest"appearance in the dialogue where and when it is appropriate.This will be especially when you are communicating with some of the Elementals that work with the Earth. SE1:Suffice to say,most of what we will be discussing will be relevant to the multiversal environment that I created and that most of your readers will relate to.

O:However,there will be times when the bigger picture of my polyomniscient area of sentient self-awareness will need to be taken into consideration,and so at these junctures in the dialogue I will communicate with you. ME:Feels good to me. SE1:Good.We will start whenever you are ready. ME:How about right now! SE1:Why not.

## A Myth Buster 

ME:I want to start first with a base-line understanding of the structure of what we call the Angelic realms.I just want to show the truth-seeking world that we have interacted with these beings before and have given them labels-names and descriptions of their functions.But,I don't want to go down the route of justifying,or not,as the case may be, the imagery and descriptions of those entities mankind has classified to date,no matter how close or far away from the truth it is.What I want is,as normal,the Greater Reality that supports the current understanding,along with a little bit more if possible. I have to admit here to cheating a little because some of this information was in a document I wrote in 2005.Note that I am still drawn to use the abbreviation for The Source as SE1 and not just SE as in The History of God. SE1:We can look at them first if you wish,but note that we may not deal with them on an individual basis,or for that matter,on a group basis either in some cases. ME:Why not? SE1:Because this may not be the reality of the structure of entities who have committed to be in service in my multiversal environment. ME:OK,let's treat it as what mankind knows to date by drawing upon my previous work and you commenting where you wish to,busting the myths as we go.

SE1:That will be a starting point at least. ME:Thank you. SE1:Are you sure that you want to start now? ME:No.I am changing my mind. SE1:I thought you might be.You are realizing that you cannot quote the information from one religion without also quoting the corresponding information from the other major religions. ME:You still have me cornered,don't you!Even after all these years,you still know when I haven't understood the issue-even before I realize it! SE1:Of course.Don't forget that I know everything that you have asked,are asking,and will ask.It's an interestingly small but effective advantage that I have over you in this incarnate state.What I would suggest is that you use the overall structure from the document you created in 2005 as a minor reference to that which some of mankind knows. Later in the dialogue you can look at the bigger picture.[The 2005 document was created as a dissertation as part of my healing examinations.-GSN] ME:OK,it sounds like a plan. SE1:Good.The first thing I want to state is that,irrespective of its level of correctness, the information you have refers only to the physical universe and has no reference to the rest of the structure of my multiversal environment.This in itself is a major limitation in the ability of existing information to express the aspect of the Greater Reality that it is supposed to be describing. ME:So the first myth to be broken is that of the structure of the higher realms.Those realms or environments that are classified as the areas within the universe where the angels exist in all their hierarchical variations are not only limited to the physical universe,they are limited to mankind's knowledge and thinking ability. SE1:Yes.Remember that the information that most of incarnate mankind has is the product of its recent frequential state,educational levels,and subsequent expansiveness, the frequential levels only being elevated in the last forty years with real changes happening in the last ten to fifteen years. ME:So what is the structure?And,what are the names or roles of the entities that work with this structure? SE1:Describing the roles,responsibilities,and functions of those entities that have chosen to be of service by maintaining the structure of the multiverse and its evolutionary efficiency is the whole point of this dialogue,and,as a result,the detail will be presented to you in a way that will be both progressive and logical in its application.Moreover,it will need to be described in summary from the top down and explained in detail from the bottom up.In this way the readers will gain an idea of the breadth of the subject matter we will discuss,allowing the depth to become more digestible as we move along.

Do note,though,that we are talking about those entities that are not only maintaining the structure and its detail,but also those that are involved in the perpetuation of the structure. ME:What do you mean the perpetuation of the structure?I would have thought that maintaining it perpetuated it? SE1:No,those entities that maintain the structure of the multiverse do just that,maintain it.They maintain it for those entities that use the multiverse for evolutionary purposes. Because a number of entities want to use it for evolutionary purposes,their focus is on being within the structure of the multiverse,experiencing it,using it,creating within it, progressing through it-not maintaining it. However,in their desire to be within the multiverse to evolve by experiencing its environments in both its linear and parallel states,parallel states are created by invoking the functionality of Event Space,if you remember;they create an energy that provides what you would call a memory.This "Memory"energy is that which sustains the perpetuation of the structure and the creative and created detail behind the structure.It is these entities that enter into the evolutionary cycle that create the myriad variations of the environmental,experiential conditions and personal interactional opportunities necessary to allow balanced evolutionary progression,and not a skewed evolutionary progression that maintains the need for its existence.The entities in the evolutionary cycle subconsciously want these environmental,experiential,and personal interactive conditions to continue so that they can play out all of the variations that may be on offer and as a result,expose themselves and others to the full depth or quality of experience. I created the multiverse out of the structure and sentient energies that The Origin assigned to create me as an independent but integrated function of myself,allowing smaller individualized parts of me to delve into the detail of that which is me.The beauty of this creation is that it is not the same multiverse that I created in the first instance.It has changed;it has evolved.This is a result of its manipulation,manipulation by those smaller individualized versions of me-you-who wanted to experience the multiverse in different configurative states.These configurative states are transient because the creative force behind them is not as strong as my creative force and so they cannot be maintained unless there is a focus on their continued existence,for without the desire for them to be in existence,the multiversal structure returns back to its original state,that state which I created in the first instance. ME:So even those who use the multiverse for evolutionary purposes are maintenance entities-by default! SE1:Correct.Every entity that is created by me has a role in the maintenance of the multiverse and its perpetuation as a creation of the collective of smaller individualized versions of me.Don't forget,everything,every entity and every environment,is a function of me. ME:Thank you.It is always good to be reminded of this most basic but most forgotten or ignored truth. SE1:Good.So,the first thing I am going to do is expose a few myths. The first myth to be exposed is that the entities that are called Angels are based upon the human form;they are not. The second myth to be exposed is that I have a human form and that the Angels sit beside me;I do not and they do not. The third myth to be exposed is that these entities exist next to me in something called a mobile [see religious texts-GSN],which is a section or location within the divine mind and it is also part of a hierarchy;they do not and it is not.Although I do have to say,it's not a bad guess if you think that the total volume of my sentient energies,that is all of me,can be classified as "Mind,"so if you think in this way,every entity is next to my mind simply because it is part of my mind or sentience. The fourth myth to be exposed is that the Angels are distributed in the hierarchy that religion describes them in-the nine choirs;they are not. The fifth myth to be exposed is that the Angels work only for the maintenance and guidance of those who incarnate on the Earth,and its environment,the physical universe; they do not.They have myriad responsibilities that include the Earth,the physical universe,and many other bodies that are made from locally low-frequency energy which do not specifically exist in the physical universe. The sixth myth to be exposed is that the entities that work with the details of the earthly environment,the Elementals,what humankind calls fairies,leprechauns,and other similarly descriptive names,are based upon the human form;they are not.Other names for mythical forms such as pixies,elves,and the like are simply the memories of those who observed other humanoid forms,those incarnates that also exist within the physical universe and that have visited the Earth from time to time. The seventh myth to be exposed is that those entities that are called Ascended Masters have human form;they do not. ME:That's a lot of myths to consider. SE1:In reality,this is only a small number of the things associated with the description of the names,roles,and functions surrounding those entities that are created by me and chose to be of service to me and those entities that entered into the evolutionary cycle. There are names,roles,and functions in other religions to describe similar entities but in essence they are all the same.You see,mankind in its use of different teachers to educate itself on how to exist in the incarnate state without becoming addicted to it, to not accrue karma,ends up moving away from the original teaching.Descriptions of the teachings change simply as a result of the teaching style of the teacher,its specialist subjects,and its own preferences to what is taught and how it is presented to its students. This quickly results in dilution and diversification from the original subject matter.So, although there may be some crossover or correlation in the information broadcast by different religions,the emphasis and focus may be completely different,and some or all of the detail may be completely different.One thing is certain,though;all religions recognize a creator and those entities that support the creator,irrespective of what they are called and what their roles and responsibilities are.The function of this dialogue is therefore to offer a religion-free,neutral,and up-to-date rendition of the mechanics of the environment you exist within,what maintains it,and how it is maintained.

## The Structure of the Multiverse We Exist Within: A Deeper Understanding 

I have no doubt that this part of the book will be all too familiar to those dear souls who have read my other books and as a result I note that it will be tempting to bypass this chapter.For those that have not read the previous books,it will be essential to the understanding of the rest of the content.I do,however,urge all readers to read this chapter,notjust because it will act as a refresher,but because Ifeel that we will be exposed to new and deeper details about the structure of the multiverse and its functionality. SE1:That was a good introduction. ME:I only said what I felt! SE1:Maybe,but it is accurate to state that we will be going into some more depth about the finer structure of the multiverse,specifically where and how the maintenance entities come into it.What I would suggest first is that you give an overview of the structure in your own words and I will add the additional understanding of the structural content at the end, when you have finished your description. ME:OK,here we go. The multiversal environment within which we exist was created by The Source,from its own energies and structural references and is located within The Source.The multiverse being within the boundary energies that designates the difference between the sentient energies that were individualized,designated as a Source Entity and given a "reason to be"by the ultimate creator-The Origin-and those sentient energies and their structures that are currently reserved for The Origin's work on understanding itself.The multiverse occupies nearly one-half of The Source's volume of sentient energy and is occupied by billions of smaller individualized versions or units of its self,our True Energetic Selves (TES).Our TES were created for the sole purpose of understanding the fine detail of The Source's sentience,its energies and structure,which in turn provides The Origin with a greater understanding of its self.The sentient energies that make up the total number of TES plus the sentient energies that make up the multiverse equals the full one-half of the total volume of The Source Entity's sentient energies and its structure. The structure of the multiverse itself follows the same structural rules as the lower structural condition of The Source,its self,and ultimately The Origin.The lower structure of Source is based upon the relationship between frequency,subdimensional components, and full dimensions,the frequencies being the basic building blocks.Starting from the highest structural level of the multiverse,the full dimensions,we can see that the multiverse has twelve of them.The number twelve is significant and is prevalent in the continuation of the structure in the higher levels of The Source's structure and,of course, The Origin's.The structure of the multiverse has a generalized function that is repeated in all full dimensions apart from the first full dimension,which houses the very lowest frequencies.I will describe the structure of the first full dimension last.

The structure is therefore as follows;from the second full dimension upward to the twelfth,each full dimension is subject to being constructed from three sublevels or subdimensional components.Each of these sublevels are progressive,that being,they have a higher or lower position relative to each other within the space occupied by the full dimension.So in this progressive nature the third subdimensional component of the second full dimension is lower in the multiversal structure than the first subdimensional component of the third full dimension.Each subdimensional component houses twelve frequency levels or bands.Each frequency level is progressive in its finitude and is capable of housing a simultaneous self-contained universal environment.For illustrative purposes then,the twelfth frequency of the third subdimensional component of the second full dimension is higher than the eleventh frequency of the third subdimensional component of the second full dimension,but,it is lower than the first frequency of the first subdimensional component of the third full dimension.The simultaneous self-contained universes are static and progressive universal environments in terms of their function and content and exist simultaneously with each other.They are not parallel universes which are created by Event Space through the ability of those entities that occupy the simultaneous universes to make choices.Parallel universes (local,planetary,planetary system,galactic,and universe-sized)are created and dissolved through the power of individual choice.The simultaneous universes remain in existence for the duration of a full evolutionary cycle and are therefore classified as a static function of the multiverse that we as evolving entities progress through. In summary then,from the second full dimension through to the twelfth full dimension, each dimension has three subdimensional components,each subdimensional component has twelve frequency levels or bands,and each frequency level houses a simultaneous universal environment.Each full dimension from the second full dimension through to the twelfth full dimension therefore has thirty-six frequency levels or bands and therefore thirty-six simultaneous universes associated to it.This makes a subtotal of eleven full dimensions multiplied by three subdimensional components multiplied by twelve frequency levels equals three hundred and ninety-six frequency levels and simultaneous universes (11 x 3 x 12 396 frequencies and universes). As stated a moment ago,the first full dimension houses the lowest of the frequencies associated with the structure of the multiverse,but,because it houses the lowest of the multiversal frequencies,it behaves in a different way to the other full dimensions.The first full dimension is constructed from three sublevels or subdimensional components in the same way as higher full dimensions,with exception that the lower frequencies cause these subdimensional components to converge into one composite subdimensional component that exhibits the functions of all three but in one space. Because this subdimensional component exists in one space,it can only house twelve frequency levels or bands.Because these frequencies are so low,even though they are progressive,they are not capable of housing a simultaneous self-contained universal environment in their own right.However,because the composite subdimensional component associated with the first full dimension exists in a singular space,these twelve frequencies also need to exist in a singular space and as a result create a single simultaneous self-contained universal environment that uses all twelve frequencies- thus creating what we call the physical universe. So again in summary,the first full dimension houses three subdimensional components that compress to a single composite subdimensional component.This single composite subdimensional component houses twelve frequency levels or bands,but because they exist in one space,and because these frequencies are so low,they can only create one simultaneous self-contained universal environment.This makes a subtotal of one full dimension multiplied by one composite subdimensional component multiplied by twelve frequency levels equals twelve frequency levels associated with the first full dimension but dividing twelve by twelve because the frequencies occupy one space equals one simultaneous universe (1 x 3 1,1 x 1212 frequencies,and,1 x 3 1,1 x 12/12 1 universe). In totality then,we have 396 frequencies in full dimensions two through twelve plus twelve frequencies in the first full dimension equals 408 frequencies (396 12 408 frequency levels).And we also have 396 simultaneous universes in full dimensions two through twelve plus one simultaneous universe in the first full dimension equals 397 simultaneous universes(396 1 =397 universes). I make a point of reference here to note that what mankind thinks of as dimensions are,in my understanding,frequency levels and not dimensions per se,because the subdimensional components and full dimensions are much,much higher levels of structure.Although we as incarnate beings exist in a universe within the multiverse that needs twelve frequencies to create it,we can only see and detect the first three frequencies. So,as a result,we see the universe as being mostly empty whereas in reality there is infinitesimally more content and incarnate beings,within the other nine frequencies, resulting in a mostly full rather than mostly empty universe. SE1:That's a good summary of the structure of the multiverse as you currently know it.I will elaborate on the gaps in your knowledge base. As you may have worked out,there are frequencies between the frequencies that you know of.In the wider multiversal environment,the frequency levels or bands that house the self- contained simultaneous universes have subfrequencies that allow the resolution or detail available in a specific universal environment where the availability of more subfrequencies equals more depth of universal content and functionality.Think of it in terms of an image where the number of pixels available in a square millimeter affecting how much an image can be enlarged before pixilation occurs,and,when pixilation does occur,the gaps in resolution between the pixels is where any increases in resolution can be affected and, from a frequential perspective,the subfrequencies exist.I will deal with the multiversal environment in more detail in a moment,but first I want to focus on the environment incarnate mankind exists within,the physical universe. As you stated earlier,the first dimension houses just one universe,the physical universe, and the physical universe requires twelve frequencies to create enough resolution to allow the functionality associated with a universe to manifest.The subfrequencies play a major part in the manifestation of this functionality.They allow the creation of the physical aspects of the multiverse to occur and are predominantly associated with,but not unique to,the framework for the structure associated with the lower frequencies of the physical universe. Within the physical universe,each frequency level (let's call the frequency levels the major levels)has six sublevels that fill in the gaps between.There are six sublevels between the zero level and the first level,six sublevels between the first level and the second level,and six between the second level and the third level,etc.,etc.,etc.The six sublevels associated with the first three major frequency levels,along with the major levels themselves,when expressed together in the way they are in the lowest of the frequencies of the multiverse act in a composite function.They create the form of the Gross Physical in what scientists call a three-dimensional way.However,dimensions are a much higher part of the structure of the multiverse so the use of the third dimension,etc.,as a descriptor is wholly incorrect,but as mankind is used to this terminology,even if it is incorrect,it will help in its understanding.The highest component of the physical is known as the atom and the lowest component of the physical is expressed as the Anu. It is also worth noting that there is space in between the components of all six subfrequential levels and that this is a structure in its own right allowing what you might call either a substructure to exist that is the reciprocal of the structure that is used by incarnate beings and other non-incarnates.This reciprocal structure,although not identical to the structure incarnates and other non-incarnate beings use as part of the function of the multiverse used for the evolutionary cycle,can be classified as the other side of the physical,the physical energies being loosely classified as "matter,"the space in between the structure,in between the six subfrequential levels can therefore be classed as antimatter.I am going to bust another myth here because the energy that I just called antimatter will not explode when in contact with the energy that I classified as matter, simply because they are part of the overall structure,the one existing within and without the other. It is this substructure or antimatter structure that is used for "holding"the structure that is used for the evolutionary cycle in logical steps of progression.It keeps the content and functionality associated with the structure used for the evolutionary cycle apart,allowing correct areas of demarcation.This allows the entities that work with the maintenance of the multiversal structure and loosely therefore associated with the evolutionary cycle to keep the multiverse in the highest level of evolutionary efficiency. ME:Hold on a minute,are you suggesting that antimatter exists? SE1:Yes and no.Yes,insomuch as there is a reciprocal to the space you all use within the multiversal environment,and,no,because it does not function or behave in the way your scientists or even science fiction writers would have you believe it does.For instance,there is no universe-shattering explosion when these two components of the multiverse are in contact with each other simply because they are already integral to each other. ME:So,where did the scientists go wrong?What led them to make this assumption?

SE1:Limited thinking based upon lack of knowledge. ME:Is that it? SE1:Yes,a simple response,isn't it?Although it is simple,it is both very true and a big issue because it creates a train of thought,a thought process that is in error,and because it is used,it creates bigger errors in thought. ME:So to go down an educated route with an open mind,I ask again for the benefit of the readers,does antimatter exist? SE1:If you are looking for an absolute as a function of my answer,then I will say that it doesn't.I just used the term as a descriptor to help with the understanding of reciprocal space.In fact,if you want to push harder in this direction,I will further state that there is more than one reciprocal space,more than one substructure. ME:What do you mean by more than one reciprocal space? SE1:In the description I just gave,I eluded to just one substructure,one reciprocal space. This was a description based upon human thinking,one where there is an opposite to everything-this is dualistic thinking.Even spiritual individuals think of the physical as the universe of duality.Others think of it in terms of opposites:black and white,up and down,left and right,forward or backward,matter or antimatter,of yin or yang,of balance, that there are always two sides to a story,etc.,etc.,etc.The fact is that the space in- between the structure of the multiverse is,if one were to use the word "big"as a metric, significantly bigger than the multiversal structure itself. It was at this point that I received an image to help with the words used.I saw the structure of the multiverse as a series of lines in a matrix,a very complicated matrix,one where there were matrices within matrices,and these matrices housed other matrices and were in turn housed by other matrices.Everything was within and without and back within and without again in countless iterations of complexity.However,irrespective of the complexity the structural components that made up what I amjust told to call the evolutionary or operational side of the multiversal structure,there was a surrounding space.Every component of the structure whether it was subfrequency,frequency,subdimension,or full dimension was surrounded by a substructural component or,as I am just told to call it,"essence."As with the physical universe, where there are six sublevels in between the frequency levels,there appeared to be six reciprocal spaces surrounding the evolutionary or operational structure.As I looked closer,I noticed that this description was not quite accurate.In fact,it was very inaccurate by what appeared to be to the power of six.I looked again and kept my mind fully open for anything that would add to the clarity of vision and understanding of what was being presented to me.I didn't have to wait long.It was as if every component was surrounded by a group of six by six sets of energies,of substructures.Thirty-six substructural energies in total surrounded each and every evolutionary or operational component of the multiverse.It had the appearance of being surrounded by a,I can only word it in these terms,a football (UK football-GSN)of energy.A "Bucky Ball"would be a better description,except that it didn't follow the geometric laws surrounding a Bucky Ball.Each collective of six by six substructural energies,each Bucky Ball, not only surrounded a specific evolutionary or operational structural component of the multiverse but it also surrounded the energies associated with the next collective of six by six substructural energies.I "zoomed out,"refocusing my vision to a point where I could see more of the structure or the operational and substructural condition of the multiverse.From this vantage point,I could see that the whole space was essentially substructural,the evolutionary or operational components being a very,very small part of the overall volume of the structure. Every space was filled by substructure,by one of these six by six collective structures,and there were no gaps!This I found very interesting because if anyone has the inclination to look up the geometry of a Bucky Ball,they will see that when two or more are together,they present structural gaps in between each other external to their structure where the structures don't meet or touch each other.However,this was not the case here.No matter how much I zoomed into the structure,every potential gap was filled with a six by six structural collective.They seemed to blend into each other,linking together,not on the surface as we would expect,but at a level within each other where a potential gap would be irradiated.The effect was that the evolutionary or operational structure of the multiverse,the matrices within matrices,was immersed in a collective of six by six substructural components that all joined together at whatever level necessary to ensure that there was a uniform supporting environment with no gaps,weaknesses,or lack of structural connectivity for the multiverse to exist within. Everything within this"sea"of substructure was connected to everything else-totally,either by direct contact at the same level or through indirect contact associated with another six by six substructural collective,or,at a different level via interconnected structural collectives.I didn't dare look at the ratio of evolutionary/operational multiversal structure versus substructure, but suffice to say,the evolutionary/operational structure of the multiverse paled into insignificance in comparison. With this revelation firmly seated in my mind,I burst forth an exclamation to The Source Entity. ME:It's mostly substructure!There is no duality,no chance for an equal measure of matter and antimatter(structure and substructure).There is no possibility for antimatter to exist because the reciprocal structure is the substructure.It can't even be called "reciprocal" because it isn't!The multiverse looks like a small structure in a huge bath of interlaced Bucky Balls. SE1:Very well done.The volume of the six by six collective substructural components all together is such that it both supports the structure of the multiverse and allows its manipulation,modification,and improvement.It is the roles of the entities that elect to be of service that maintain both the structure and its functionality at the high and lower levels of structure,functionality,and evolutionary efficiency that use the surrounding substructure to move around the multiversal environment at all of its levels without actually being within the structure of the multiverse. ME:I have another question. SE1:Go ahead. ME:How does Event Space figure in all of this;do the maintenance entities work with the parallel versions of the multiverse,none of it,or just parts of it?

SE1:The substructure allows for the expansion and contraction of the multiversal structure resulting from the interaction of Event Space-based possibilities. ME:How does the multiversal structure expand and contract?I thought that everything was in the same space? SE1:It is.The expansion and contraction is based upon the level of detail associated with a particular location within the multiverse or the whole multiverse itself.As you have just witnessed,the reciprocal space,the substructure associated with the evolutionary or operational multiversal structure,is significantly larger and of greater resolution than the evolutionary or operational multiversal structure itself.This allows an area of Event Space to be contained within the areas of possibility associated with the multiverse in a way that ensures that it is disconnected with the normal pervasion of Event Space that is within everything that is me or The Origin. ME:So you keep the Event Spaces that are associated with the multiverse quarantined? SE1:Yes. ME:How is this possible? SE1:I will explain that in a moment.First,though,I will finish off what I was describing. As I was stating,this allows an area of Event Space to be contained within the areas of possibility associated with the multiverse in a way that ensures that it is disconnected with the normal pervasion of Event Space that is within everything that is me or The Origin because it reflects it back upon itself. ME:I remember that The Origin advised me that Event Space is both local and nonlocal in terms of its functionality,and,even though it pervades everything that is The Origin and its creations,it is still difficult to see how something that is so pervasive is able to be localized. SE1:The quarantine effect is created by Event Space as it uses the resolution created by the six by six collective substructures to house the parallel structure/s required to support the parallel conditions created by the entities that create them.The substructure therefore becomes the evolutionary and operational structure of the parallel condition,"for"the parallel condition.This keeps Event Space associated with the multiverse local only to the multiverse and not to the wider sentient and non-sentient energies associated with me or The Origin. ME:But isn't that limiting?I mean,doesn't that limit the number of Event Spaces that can be created to a function relative to the six by six substructural collective? SE1:Yes and no.The limitations are only really associated with the expansion to the area of Event Space and not its proliferation per se.Based upon this,the limitations to the number of alternative and parallel environments,localized within the multiverse or attributed to the wider area of the multiverse,is a function of the number of interactive levels of the six by six substructural collectives.For example,if 6 six by six substructural collectives were in functional interaction with each other in and around the evolutionary and operational multiversal structure,then this would result in a synergetic effect of the ability to create six to the power of six,to the power of six,to the power of six,to the power of six,to the power of six,to the power of six Event Spaces within them. However,in creating the potential for all these local or wider environments it recreates the potential for the creation of the supporting substructure within the substructures created,effectively recreating the structure so that the function of parallelism can start again while being contained within the original structure.Based upon this,although there appears to be a limitation to the number of parallel environments that can be created by the,for example,possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities,etc.,etc.,in actual fact,there are no limitations because the new Event Spaces,once a certain number of spaces is reached,recreate the structure they are within,within the structure they were within,and that which they will create within the substructure of the multiverse.In this way Event Space is constrained to a localized spatial environment rather than expanded into a wider area of space. ME:So in this respect,there is always a reciprocal or substructure for the maintenance entities to work within that surrounds a parallelized evolutionary and operational location within the multiverse. SE1:Correct.Event Space,when invoked,creates a parallel version of everything while keeping it within the structure of the original evolutionary/operational multiversal and substructural environment.This is of course provided that the surrounding substructure is created in the way we are just describing,by the use of the six by six substructural collective. There is another reason for the ability to quarantine Event Space in this way. ME:What is that? SE1:It is difficult to describe in detail but one of the functions of the six by six collectives is to create a mirroring effect,one that is similar to the effect you have when you place two mirrors in a position where they face each other. ME:Go on? SE1:It is the mirroring effect of the six by six collective that reflects the parallel evolutionary/operational multiversal environments and the associated parallel substructure that is Event Space,back within itself and its creating Event Space and then back to an opposing Event Space that keeps it all in the same space.The mirroring effect continues until the number of parallel conditions that need to be created are created and/ or are dissolved when they need to be dissolved. ME:And this only happens when the structure is as just described. SE1:Correct. ME:And this is only relative to the multiversal environment that you created?

SE1:For the purposes of this dialogue,yes.Although if you had asked the right questions a few years ago,when you were communicating with the other Source Entities,you would have found out that this is not an uncommon method. ME:What about the maintenance entities?Are they reproduced in the same way as the environment is? SE1:No,they are not subject to parallelism.They have to work with all of the potential parallel and actual environmental conditions as they are created and dissolved.They have a difficult job to do.This is another reason why the substructure is significantly larger than the evolutionary or operational multiversal structure;they have to move around and work with all that is,all that could be,and all that was. I thought about this for a moment.I had encountered a similar thing before when working on The Anne Dialogues.In this instance,Anne and I were discussing the functions of the guides and that they had to work with the parallel versions of our incarnate selves when we made decisions based upon a number of choices.These choices can and do create other fractal versions of ourselves the further downstream one looked.I shuddered at the thought of having to work with not just a plethora of parallel versions of entities that a Guide or Helper is/are responsible for,and the complexity associated with such responsibility,but that,in comparison with the work a maintenance entity was responsible for,in terms of the parallel versions of local, planetary,system,galactic,and universal-even multiversal environments-it was but a drop in the multiversal ocean.What a job,I thought.What responsibility!How could they possibly achieve or respond to such a level of responsibility?

I suddenly gained an image in my mind of the truly infinite possibilities-the possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities and the possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities associated with those possibilities,etc.,etc.,etc.My poor human brain went into overload andI snapped out of the image.It was gone andI was left perplexed.This was not the first time I have been left perplexed but it may be the first time I have advertised the fact in one of my books. The Source,feeling that I was in need of consolation of some sort,decided to give additional explanation that would make the information easier to digest.One of the questions in the forefront of my mind was this.Just how can an entity work with a moving target-such as the increase and decrease of the multiversal and universal environments including their localized versions-and hope to get the work they are doing correct in terms of ensuring the correct levels of evolutionary efficiency are maintained,and that this level of correctness is not only consistency for the mainstream environment,but all of the possible and actual environments? SE1:That is a very long question. ME:It wasn't meant to be.It just turned out to be long. SE1:Nevertheless,it was appropriate.First,this is why there are so many entities that are involved in the maintenance of the multiversal environment.Second,this is why there is a hierarchy associated with them,and third,this is why there is a large list of the different roles,responsibilities,and specialisms they have to perform.Every entity has a role to perform.At one end of the scale,some of them have pan-dimensional/ spatial responsibilities whereas at the other end of the scale,they have very focused responsibilities based upon one frequential state and location.I will indicate the levels of responsibilities in summary later,and we can go into the detail of the entities associated with those responsibilities,for this will form the basis for the remainder of this dialogue. Before I illustrate these higher level responsibilities,though,I will advise you again of the following;the names,roles,and status of those entities classified as Angels and Demons, for example,are both wholly inaccurate and oversimplified,even in their inaccuracy. ME:Why are they inaccurate and oversimplified? SE1:Because they are based upon the knowledge of the time that the information was made available,and the ability of the people at that time,based upon the level of their education,to understand that information and the frequential level of these individuals and their teachers.If you look at any religious texts,you will see that the descriptions associated with these entities are in very simple levels of detail,detail of which bears next to no resemblance with the actual roles,responsibilities,and status they have. I thought for a moment about the document I created in 2005 about the roles and responsibilities of God's helpers.It was a simple summary of the information I had gathered on the subject,which in itself was simple.I decided that I would include a sanitized version within this text to give the reader a basic-very basic-understanding of the existing knowledge on this subject.It made me smile.Not because it was cheating-if indeed using my existing but previously unpublished material is cheating-but because it was making use of a piece of work that I thought I would have no further use for.

Everything has a reason and every piece of work has a role to play,I thought.I was deciding whether to ask The Source for the higher level descriptions of the entities that maintain the evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse now,or after the insertion of my eleven-year-old document when The Source advised me to use my work first.I questioned it on this decision, though,before continuing. SE1:It would be better to give the readers a revision of that which they think they know about before introducing them to the detail of my reality. ME:I would have thought that the introduction of my previous work would confuse the readers if it was before your description,specifically as we have just been discussing the background surrounding their description? SE1:My initial thoughts were to keep on going-going with your flow.However,right at the very start of this dialogue you had it in the back of your mind to use your old material as a descriptor first,and then move into a dialogue with me.I see that this has merit and as I just stated,it would be a good way to offer the readers a revision of some of the existing information. Before we change to your previous work,though,I want to leave the readers with this thought.For each and every one of you that exists in the incarnate state,there is at least a billion [old billion,a million million-GSN]others working on your behalf.Not just helping you to be successful in your incarnate evolutionary responsibility but also working on maintaining the structure and evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse that your True Energetic Self exists within and evolves through. The detail in this dialogue will focus on those entities that are relevant to your current incarnate environment,the Earth,its system and galaxy,and its supporting universal/ multiversal environment.It would be pointless for you to know the details of all those entities that work with other planets,systems,and galaxies within the physical universe simply because they are specific to those areas of locally low frequency,those that allow the creation of planets.Nevertheless,it will provide some insight to what they "could be" because there will be a level of carry-over functionality with them when compared with those of the Earth.

## A General Understanding of God's Helpers as Currently Understood 

### God's Hierarchy 

It is generally understood within all religion bases that God has his/her helpers, and that there is a distinct pecking order.The understanding of what God's helpers actually do is the subject of somewhat dubious interpretation based upon the teachings, myths,and stories of the ancestral races of mankind.There are,however,three main viewpoints on who/what God's helpers are and what their responsibilities are.These are relative to the Egyptian view,the Greek/Roman view,and the Christian/spiritual view. However,reading between the lines suggests that their responsibilities are related to the management of the universe and all its elements,irrespective of whose viewpoint you are looking from.These are illustrated below. 

### Egyptian Gods 

There are effectively two views on what God is from the Egyptian perspective.The first is the popular view,which is discussed in the paragraph immediately following this introduction.The second is a lesser known view,and,although I say view here,I actually believe that the view expressed by Isha Schwaller De Lubicz is a deeper understanding of a deeper reality which the inner circles of Egyptian priesthood had of the meaning of the universe,the beings that maintained it,and the powers/energies at their disposal The Popular Understanding of the Egyptian Gods Many books have been written on religion in ancient Egypt expressing what is essentially a popular view on the Egyptian Gods.Religion in ancient Egypt was not unlike modern times.Today,not everyone believes in the same way,or of the same God,and Egypt was no different.Individual kings worshipped their own Gods,as did the workers,priests, merchants,and peasants.Pre-dynastic Egypt had formulated the ideas and beliefs of a "greater being,"which was expressed in pictures.The pictures had ideas and took on human traits.The Gods lived,died,hunted,went into battle,gave birth,ate,drank,and had human emotions.The Gods'reigns overlapped,and,in some instances,merged.There was no organized hierarchical structure of their reign so the dominance of the Gods depended on the beliefs of the reigning king with their area of dominance depending on where the king wanted his capital.Also,the myths changed with the location of the Gods, as did their names.Names in ancient Egypt were very mystic and powerful and it was thought that if you inscribed your enemies'name on something,then broke it,that enemy would either be afflicted or possibly die.If you knew a name you had power and using a name could be beneficial.Each God had five names,with each being associated with an element,such as air or celestial bodies;some were a descriptive statement about the God, such as strong,virile,or majestic.

The creator of all things was either Ra,Amun,Ptah,Khnum,or Aten,depending on which version of the myth was currently in use.The heavens were represented by Hathor,Bat, and Horus.Osiris was an Earth God as was Ptah.The annual flooding of the Nile was Hapi.Storms,evil,and confusion were Seth.His counterpart was Ma'at,who represented balance,justice,and truth.The moon was Thoth and Khonsu.Ra,the sun God,took on many forms,and transcended most of the borders that contained the other Gods. The actual shape of the sun,the disk (or,aten),was deified into another God,Aten. Interestingly enough Amun-Ra-Ptah is known as the three-in-one being. Certain Gods were worshipped in different areas.Local cities or villages,known as nomes, often had unique Gods that were known only to that region.On occasion,these Gods attained country-wide recognition and became the myths and legends that were passed on from century to century. The "Schwaller de Lubicz"View of the Egyptian Gods In direct opposition to the popularist view of what the Gods were in Egyptian times, Schwaller de Lubiczi purports to having an understanding that removes the "human" aspect of the Egyptian Gods and replaces it with a more functional aspect of a series of beings who are"managing"the functionality of the local universe. In Schwaller de Lubicz's eyes Egyptian religion is based upon a mathematical understanding of the "Truth"and although the descriptions above are consistent with those illustrated in Her Bak,Schwaller de Lubicz clearly has a larger knowledge base and therefore clearer/deeper understanding of what the Egyptian Gods represent.These are illustrated below: There are a number of variations on this theme depending on the location of origin of the inscribed data.However,the Heliopolis theme is represented in all of the other locations of Memphis,Hermopolis,and Thebes. Nun-The universe(Primordial Chaos) Ra-Atum(the sun God)-He who creates Shutefnut-Produces Geb(Earth)and Nut(Sky) Geb and Nut create the four nature Neters,Osiris,Isis,Seth,and Nephtys(although there are eight Neters mentioned,only four have been identified and understood) Amun-Ra is the king of the Neters and can be represented as the condenser of energy.The variations on Amun,Ra,Ptah's name are also consolidated later and called the Amun-Ra- Ptah(the three-in-one!).The Neters are the causal powers of everything that is manifest/ functions in the universe. The worlds of the Egyptians are described in three ways:Heaven,Earth,and Dwat, which translate as Celestial,Terrestrial,and Intermediate.The Intermediate can also be classified as the astral worlds.They are explained in more detail below. Heaven Is the world of causal/spiritual powers,the properties in themselves (all possibilities are possible). Dwat Is the intermediate world(in between day and night)and is split into two: That which is born of terrestrial genesis. That which is emerged from terrestrial existence. Within this is Thot,who is the Neter of specifications.He determines the types of nature with numbers and divine geometry. Earth Is that which is concrete/materialized.It is the state of embodiment of the form and represents ideas of everything brought forth by nature from the four elementary constituents of matter (Earth,Wind,Fire,and Water)up to their most complex combinations of stars,inorganic matter,and organic beings.It is the world of bodies (Thot,Ptah),the innate fire of terrestrial matter who created it.Osiris U-Nefer is the master of all cycles of renewal in nature such as vegetative life. The Neters and Their Hierarchy The Neters are the expression of the functions of divine power,and a hierarchy can only be established by trying to ascertain if the function under consideration is more spiritual or more material,more universal or more particular,more absolute or more relative.The Egyptians did attempt (as we do today)to make this fit into the human mind and its limited intelligence and developed the various functions of each Neter through myth to ensure that a specific formula does not create a specialized definition.This ensured that the definition of Amun-Ra-Ptah's role still relates to the three-in-one of heavenly, intermediate,and terrestrial attributes,a trait that,we will see later,was not taken by the later messengers of God whose understanding of who God is resulted in a slightly but nevertheless significantly different view on who God was and what he wanted from mankind.However,in Christianity's defense the three-in-one description was upheld as a rational description of God and his/her relationship with the Earth plane. The Neters Acting in the Heavenly World The Neters are part of the divine and heavenly being(God). Amun-Is the never born. Ra-Is the universal and contains the function ofAtum as potentiality. Horus-The heart and immanent word of Ra. Neith-The cosmic virgin (I am that which is,that which will be,that which has been). These are the first intelligible aspects of causal power-the source of inexhaustible life in the universe.

The Neters Acting in the Intermediate World Amun-In this instance is descending toward the genesis and is the "bringer of light,"the sacred power of the secret language. Atum-The Solar Neter who stands between night and day and is the first division into two. Osiris,Isis,Seth,Nephtys,Horus-Are the Neters of the intercalary days and are neither in Heaven nor Earth. Hathor and Nut-Are the Neters of the lower Heaven.They have relationships with the forces and beings of the Dwat. Thot-Is the mediator between Heaven and Earth and is the issuer of words from the creative mouth of Ptah (in the sense of the Logos!)and is master over all forms begotten by the numbers and the Neter of signatures(DNA!)that determine the terrestrial species. As the scribe of Ma'at,he records the impressions of the fixed consciousness of the Dwat (Universal Memory,Akashic records,etc.). Anubis-Is the transformer of power,allowing passage from the Earth to the lower heavens.He opens the way to the Dwat. The Neters Acting in the Terrestrial World Ptah-Continual creator for the Earth and is the agent for motive power for the Neters whose spiritual properties and abstract functions can be recognized in concrete form in the functions/properties of natural order.These are: Amun-Min-Who is a magnet and condenser of heavenly energy. Seth-Who is the principle of correctness,fixation,and separation. Anubis-Who is the transformer of putrid matter into living substance. Khnum-Who is the power of attraction.He joins complementarities and fashions new beings. Mut-Is the mother who decomposes the seeds to regenerate them.Apet-Is the principle of fertility and the multiplication of substance. The Neters of Elementary Properties Shu-dry,Tefnut-wet,Geb-warm,Nut-cold.The principle of these Neters is to be manifest by Atum to become Fire,Air,Water,Earth. The Neters of Fundamental Functions Sokar-The function of contraction and fixation.Serket-The contraction (breathing in). Neith-The function of dilation,leading to contraction and breathing out.

Wadjit-The function of dilation essential to vegetative life(opening,blooming unfolding). Amim-The function of absorption,devourer of the dead. The Four Aspects of the Feminine Principle in Nature Isis,Nephytys,Neith,and Selkis are a number of names to describe the functions that all refer to the essential,the cause,the three-in-one! On its own is Ma'at. Ma'at-impersonates justice and truth and is the presence of source and fulfillment,the beginning and end,the mediator and the essence of Ra in all times and all worlds.Ma'at is the universal consciousness,universal idea,and essential wisdom.Ma'at is the consciousness of all things and is the key to the reason for man's life on Earth and forms the basis for Egyptian philosophy. The Kings and the Gods The kings of ancient Egypt were an integral part of religion.They formed a bridge over the chasm dividing the people and the Gods.In pre-dynastic times,the kings were considered to be Gods.In later times,around the third dynasty,the kings became "transformed into" Gods.This was a crucial part of the governing of the people.The heirs to the throne were not kept out of public display.At a young age they were known to many,and were known as children,not future Gods.A king may have had many heirs and may not have known who would assume the throne until a much later time.In order for the people(and the future king)to accept the transformation,certain procedures had to be worked out.This dilemma was beautifully solved by the ritual that merged the king with the God.Belief was that all future kings had two aspects of their being,the physical being and the "ka." The ka was the spiritual counterpart that was part of the king at birth and remained with him throughout his life.Before assuming the throne,a ritual was performed that united the king's ka and his person.The king and his priests would enter a temple,perform the ritual,and emerge as a God.All of the people would wait outside to witness the miracle of the transformation when the king reemerged from the temple.In this way,the new king was accepted as a God and his word was accepted as law. 

### Greek Gods 

The Greek Gods are a natural evolutionary description of the Egyptian Gods previously explained.However,by the time that the Greeks were the dominant authority on worldly issues,the real understanding of the stories that were used to explain God and the roles and responsibilities of his/her helpers,was,from the author's point of view, misunderstood. 

#### Family Tree of the Greek Gods

[图1](img/s6-061.png)

The Greek Gods have two main eras,the era of the first of God's helpers,and the era of what I call the lesser Gods (Neters?).Both of which have their stories told in a strictly human frame of reference,a trap that the Egyptians did not fall into. The Titans The Titans,also known as the elder Gods,ruled the Earth before the Olympians overthrew them.The ruler of the Titans was Cronus,who was dethroned by his son Zeus.Most of the Titans fought with Cronus against Zeus and were punished by being banished to Tartarus.During their rule,the Titans were associated with the various planets.The Titans are Gaea,Uranus,Cronus,Rhea,Oceanus,Tethys,Hyperion,Mnemosyne,Themis, Iapetus,Coeus,Crius,Phoebe,Thea,Prometheus,Epimetheus,Atlas,Metis,Dione.The responsibilities of the Titans are illustrated below.

Gaea-Gaea is the Earth Goddess. Uranus-Uranus is the sky God and first ruler. Cronus-Was the ruling Titan who came to power by castrating his father,Uranus.His wife was Rhea.Their offspring were the first of the Olympians. Rhea-Was the wife of Cronus.Cronus made it a practice to swallow their children.To avoid this,Rhea tricked Cronus into swallowing a rock,saving her son Zeus. Oceanus-Is the unending stream of water encircling the world.Together with his wife,Tethys,they produced the rivers and the three thousand ocean nymphs. Tethys-Is the wife of Oceanus. Hyperion-Is the Titan of light,an early sun God.He is the son of Gaea and Uranus.He married his sister,Theia.Their children are Helius(the sun),Selene(the moon),and Eos(the dawn).

Mnemosyne-Was the Titan of memory and the mother of Muses. Themis-Was the Titan ofjustice and order.She was the mother of the Fates and the Seasons. Iapetus-Was the father of Prometheus,Epimetheus, Menoetius,and Atlas by Clymene. Coeus-Is the Titan of intelligence.Father of Leto. Crius and Thea-Little is known on Crius and Thea. Phoebe-Is the Titan of the Moon.Mother of Leto. Prometheus-Was the wisest Titan.His name means 'forethought"and he was able to foretell the future.He was the son of lapetus. Epimetheus-Was a stupid Titan,whose name means "afterthought."He was the son of lapetus.In some accounts, he is delegated by Zeus,along with his brother Prometheus, to create mankind.He also accepted the gift of Pandora from Zeus,which lead to the introduction of evil into the world. Atlas-Was the son of Iapetus.Unlike his brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus,Atlas fought with the other Titans supporting Cronus against Zeus.

Metis-Was the Titaness of the fourth day and the planet Mercury.She presided over all wisdom and knowledge.She was seduced by Zeus and became pregnant with Athena. Dione-Is,according to Homer in the lliad,the mother of Aphrodite. The Olympians The Olympians are a group of twelve Gods who ruled after the overthrow of the Titans. All the Olympians are related in some way and they are named after their dwelling place,Mount Olympus.The Olympian Gods are Zeus,Poseidon,Hades,Hestia,Hera,Ares, Athena,Apollo,Aphrodite,Hermes,Artemis,and Hephaestus.The responsibilities of the Olympians are illustrated below. Zeus-Zeus overthrew his father,Cronus.He then drew lots with his brothers Poseidon and Hades.Zeus won the draw and became the supreme ruler of the Gods.He is lord of the sky,the rain God.His weapon is a thunderbolt,which he hurls at those who displease him.He is married to Hera but is famous for his many affairs. Poseidon-Is the brother of Zeus.After the overthrow of their father,Cronus,he drew lots with Zeus and Hades, another brother,for shares of the world.His prize was to become lord of the sea.He was widely worshipped by seamen.He married Amphitrite,a granddaughter of the Titan Oceanus. Hades-Is the brother of Zeus.After the overthrow of their father,Cronus,he drew lots with Zeus and Poseidon, another brother,for shares of the world.He had the worst draw and was made lord of the underworld,ruling over the dead.He is a greedy God who is greatly concerned with increasing his subjects. Hestia-Is Zeus's sister.She is a virgin Goddess.She does not have a distinct personality.She plays no part in myths. She is the Goddess of the Hearth,the symbol of the house around which a newborn child is carried before it is received into the family. Hera-Is Zeus's wife and sister.She was raised by the Titans, Oceanus and Tethys.She is the protector of marriage and takes special care of married women. Ares-Is the son of Zeus and Hera.He was disliked by both parents.He is the God of war.He is considered murderous and bloodstained but also a coward. Athena-Is the daughter of Zeus.She sprang full-grown in armor from his forehead,thus has no mother.She is fierce and brave in battle but only fights to protect the state and home from outside enemies.She is the Goddess of the city, handicrafts,and agriculture. Apollo-Is the son of Zeus and Leto.His twin sister is Artemis.He is the God of music,playing a golden lyre.He is the Archer,far-shooting with a silver bow,the God of healing who taught man medicine,the God of light,and the God of truth who cannot speak a lie. Aphrodite-Is the Goddess of love,desire,and beauty.In addition to her natural gifts,she has a magical girdle that compels anyone she wishes to desire her. Hermes-Is the son of Zeus and Maia.He is Zeus's messenger.He is the fastest of the Gods.He wears winged sandals,a winged hat,and carries a magic wand.He is the God of thieves and God of commerce.He is the guide for the dead to go to the underworld.He invented the lyre,the pipes,the musical scale,astronomy,weights and measures, boxing,gymnastics,and the care of olive trees. Artemis-Is the daughter of Zeus and Leto.Her twin brother is Apollo.She is the lady of the wild things.She is the huntsman of the Gods.She is the protector of the young. Like Apollo,she hunts with silver arrows.She became associated with the moon.She is a virgin Goddess,and the Goddess of chastity.She also presides over childbirth, which may seem odd for a virgin,but goes back to causing Leto no pain when she was born. Hephaestus-Is the son of Zeus and Hera.Sometimes it is said that Hera alone produced him and that he has no father.He is the only God to be physically ugly.He is also lame.Accounts as to how he became lame vary.Some say that Hera,upset by having an ugly child,flung him from Mount Olympus into the sea,breaking his legs.Others say that he took Hera's side in an argument with Zeus and Zeus flung him off Mount Olympus.He is the God of fire and the forge.He is the smith and armorer of the Gods. Other Gods and Semi-Gods Asclepius,Demeter,Persephone,Dionysus,Eros,Hebe,Eris,Helius,Thanatos,Pan, Nemesis,The Graces,The Muses,The Erinyes,The Fates.The responsibility of the semi- and other Gods are illustrated below: Asclepius-A God of healing.His symbol is a snake.His parents were Apollo and Coronis. Demeter-Is the Goddess of corn,grain,and the harvest. She is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea.It is Demeter that makes the crops grow each year.The first loaf of bread from the harvest is sacrificed to her.Demeter is intimately associated with the seasons. Persephone-Is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter.After her abduction by Hades,she became his wife and Queen of the underworld. Dionysus-Is the God of the vine.He invented wine and spread the art of tending grapes.He has a dual nature:on the one hand,bringing joy and divine ecstasy;on the other, brutal,unthinking,and enraged thus reflecting both sides of the nature of wine. Eros-Is the son of Aphrodite.Eros is the God of love.In particular,erotic,romantic,love.He is often represented blindfolded because love is often blind.His "weapon"is a dart or an arrow. Hebe-Is the daughter of Zeus and Hera.She is the Goddess of youth.She,along with Ganymede,are the cupbearers to the Gods.Hebe is Heracles's wife. Eris-Is the daughter of Zeus and Hera.She is the Goddess of discord.In addition to her main activity of sowing discord,she frequently accompanies her brother Ares to battles.On these occasions she rides his chariot and brings her son,Strife.

Thanatos-Was the Greek God of death.He may be thought of as a personification of death.He plays little role in the myths.He became rather overshadowed by Hades,the lord of the underworld. Pan-Is the son of Hermes.He is the God of goatherds and shepherds.He is mostly human in appearance but with goat horns and goat feet.He is an excellent musician and plays the pipes.He is merry and playful frequently seen dancing with woodland nymphs. Nemesis-Means righteous anger,due enactment,or divine vengeance.This God helped to avenge those who were wronged. The Graces-They are the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome. There are three Graces:Aglaia (Splendour),Euphrosyne (Mirth),and Thalia (Good Cheer).They are known for singing and dancing for the Gods. The Muses-They are the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne.They are known for the music of their song, which brings joy to any who hear it.There are nine Muses,each with her own specialty:Clio (History),Urania (Astronomy),Melpomene (Tragedy),Thalia (Comedy), Terpsichore (Dance),Calliope (Epic Poetry),Erato (Love Poetry),Polyhymnia (Songs to the Gods),Euterpe (Lyric Poetry)

The Erinyes-Also known as the Furies,punish crime.They pursue wrongdoers relentlessly,until death,often driving them to suicide.They are particularly concerned with matricide.There are three Erinyes-Tisiphone,Megaera, and Alecto.The Erinyes came from the blood of Uranus when he was castrated. The Fates-Have the subtle but awesome power of deciding a man's destiny.They assign a man to good or evil.Their most obvious choice is choosing how long a man lives. There are three Fates:Clotho the spinner,who spins the thread of life;Lachesis the measurer,who chooses the lot in life one will have and measures off how long it is to be;and Atropos,she who cannot be turned,who at death,with her shears cuts the thread of life. 

### The Angelic Hierarchy 

As with the Egyptian and Greek understanding of the hierarchy of the helpers of God,the Angels of the Christian and spiritual religions exist in a hierarchy;i.e.,there is a form and order to the universe and its divine forces.The Angel community is the perfect example of this.The kingdom is divided into Hierarchies and Choirs.Each section of the community has its own particular purpose and energy.The Angelic Hierarchy is consistent within all of the "Christian-based religions"and can be correlated with the responsibilities of the Egyptian and Greek Gods/lesser Gods/Neters discussed above.The fact that some of these helpers are "not so good"as the others gives more weight to the correlation with the Greek and Egyptian thought process.The Hierarchy of the Angelic realm is illustrated in the next sections.Note that temple dancers in eastern religions equate to Christian Angels. The Seraphim The First Hierarchy-The First Choir The highest Choir,these are the spirits of love.They provide the universe with positive light and spirit.They exist in the Premium Mobile next to "God."(A mobile is a section of the divine mind.) This Choir consists of:·Michael·Seraphiel·Jehoel Metatron·Kemuel Uriel Nathaniel

Their properties consist of: Associated color:red and crimson for fiery love Singing praise constantly Being able to roar like a lion Being seen with scrolls of divine holy knowledge and wisdom Their appearance: They have six wings.Two are used for flying,the other four for veil faces in reverence and they stand on winged heels. The Cherubs The First Hierarchy-The Second Choir They are the second in the line of Angels.They are the spirits of harmony and are often referred to as the Angels of the air.They inhabit the fixed stars you see in each of the hemispheres at night.They represent the wisdom of God. This Choir consists of:·Gabriel Cherubiel

Ophaniel·Raphael·Zophel Their properties(consist of): Associated color:golden yellow or sapphire blue They are the guardians of the tree of life Their appearance: Since the sixteenth century,the Cherubs began to appear as whole chubby children with wings and winged heels.Prior to this,they only had a human head of a smiling child on top of what seems to be a bird's body. The Thrones The First Hierarchy-The Third Choir This Choir contains the Angels of Justice,the spirits of will who live in the essence of Saturn.Their mission is to bring judgment for individual karma and society as a whole. They are also depicted as the record keepers of the Universal Laws.Perhaps that is why they provide guidance in matters of karma,because as the record keepers,they may know better than you what karma you have to redeem and what karmic pleasures are due you. They represent the "will"that is necessary to administer justice in the universe. This Choir consists of:·Orifie·Raziel·Zaphkiel·Japhkiel·Baradiel Their properties(consist of): Associated color:gold They support the throne of God Their appearance:

They are often shown with the scales of justice and a bouquet of flowers, perhaps a sign for both sides of the law.They stand on red winged wheels and sit on lofty golden thrones. The Dominions The Second Hierarchy-The First Choir The first Choir in the Second Hierarchy are the spirits of wisdom and knowledge.These are the Angels who bring you the teachings of intuition.They inhabit the essence of Jupiter and represent the superior power of wisdom against the physical strength and intellectual egotistical forces. This Choir consists of:·Zadkil·Muriel Hashman Zacharel. Their appearance:

This Choir always appears in human shape and wearing a triple crown to signify their position over the physical form.They can be seen carrying a scepter,holding a cross and/or a sword to symbolize the balance between the active and passive forces. The Virtues The Second Hierarchy-The Second Choir This is the Choir of choice,the Angels of Movement who dwell in the essence of Mars. They watch over the centers of free will and provide the tools we need along our path to make choices to learn our spiritual lessons and overcome karmic debt.They work in hand with the Thrones to bestow grace and rewards on those who have overcome deeds in their physical lives.This Choir also likes performing miracles here on Earth,and are often thought of as the Angels who possess supreme courage. This Choir consists of:·Uzziel Gabriel Michael·Peliel Haniel

·Babiel Tarhishiel. Their appearance: They have four blue-feathered wings and wear sparkling armor.They can often be seen with a scepter,axe,spear,sword,and/or a shield for protection. But each of these "tools"is decorated with instruments of passion.Some believe this is to show humanity that to move forward in life,you must learn unconditional love,even in the face of fear or battle. The Powers ~The Second Hierarchy-The Third Choir The Angels of Form and Space.They are often associated with the essence of the Sun. They bring the power of intellect in such matters as math,geometry,astronomy,and so on.They are the professors and educators.They bring the "physical"form to the universe and its planets.They are guardians of the heavenly pathways and impose the will of God without fear or mercy. This Choir consists of:·Raphael

·Camael Verchiel. Their appearance: The Powers are often seen with swords of flame,used to protect humans and defeat the"devils." The Principalities The Third Hierarchy-The First Choir The Angels of Time and Personality,dwelling in the essence of Venus.They are the protectors of religious,political,and military leaders. This Choir consists of:·Ureil·Raphael·Raguel·Michael Gabriel Remiel.

Their appearance: Seen in human form,they are often clad in armor.They can be seen carrying a scepter,lily flower,palm leaves,and a cross. The Archangels ~The Third Hierarchy-The Second Choir The ruling angels,the spirits of fire inhabiting the essence of Mercury.These are the Angels who stand around God's throne,ready to carry out the divine and most important decrees to humans. This Choir consists of:·Michael·Raphael·Raguel Ureil Sariel Remiel Gabriel.

Their appearance: Since the fourteenth century,the Archangels have been seen in white linen and sometimes carry feathered pens and scrolls.They are often seen above all the other Angels in the Hierarchies,symbolizing their position and authority over the other Choirs that deal with humanity. The Angels The Third Hierarchy-The Third Choir The final Choir is by no means the least important.They are the messenger Angels who also govern the spirit of nature.They dwell in the essence of the Moon and are seen as the supernatural beings or guardians over humanity.They deal with the nitty- gritty of everyday life and act as the direct gateway for information,knowledge,and communications between humankind and the God force. This Choir consists of billions of entities.For every human incarnated on this planet there is a corresponding Guardian Angel to help guide them through their incarnated life. Their appearance: These Angels are seen with human bodies,wings,and clothed in various garments depending on the traditions and visual acceptance of the human they have“been assigned to..”

The Demonic Hierarchy In stark contrast to the good work of the Angels above,the distasteful side of the human psyche also has its champions.These are described below and are based upon the writings of Father Sebastion Michaelis,in 1612.2 First Hierarchy of Demons Asmodeus-avarice Astaroth-laziness Balberith-murder Beelzebub-pride Gressil-disease Leviathan-blasphemy Sonneillon-hatred Verrine-impatience. Second Hierarchy of Demons Carnivean-obscenity Carreau-cruelty

Oeillet-greed Rosier-lasciviousness Verrier-disobedience. Third Hierarchy of Demons Belais-arrogance luvart-sins not covered by other devils Olivier-parsimony. In order to completely intimidate ignorant farmers and little children,Friar Francesco Mario Buazzo,in 1608,,came up with some demons who worked as servants to the devils. Fire Demons-live in the air and get to boss around the other devils Aerial Demons-hover around human beings Terrestrial Demons-terrorize the inhabitants of forests and fields Aqueous Demons-live in water(so be careful of what you drink!) Subterranean Demons-live in caves like trolls Heliophobic Demons-only come out at night. This of course is a picture limited to the religious texts and ignores the Elementals,or does it? If we look at this short description of the demons in terms of when they appear on the Earth, we can see an interesting parallel or link with the Elementals,those entities that work closest to us and about environment.That is,apart from our Guides and Helpers,of course.Based upon this,the names that are missing are those we hold close to fairy tales,such as pixies,elves, fairies,leprechauns,and others such as nymphs and goblins.I therefore would not suggest that the imagery we have been exposed to is anywhere near correct,and neither are the names and demarcations or designations of status and functions of those we call Demons.Indeed,as I write this text,I very much get the feeling that the demarcations and designations are relevant to the level of the frequencies they work with and are not afunction of whether or not they can be classified as good or bad,helpful or mischievous in human terms.

As I work on this dialogue with The Source Entity,I will therefore introduce the relevance to those currently understood as a way for showing what is part of the Greater Reality versus what is created for the use of entertainment or control of incarnate humans through fear. 1 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz,Her-Bak,Chick-Pea,The Living Face of Egypt (Hodder and Stoughton 1954).And,Isha Schwaller de Lubicz,Her-Bak,Egyptian Initiate (Hodder and Stoughton 1956).

## The Hierarchy of Maintenance Entities 

I felt the need to repeat a thought. Somehow,somewhere incarnate mankind has retained a simulacrum of understanding about who and what help The Source/God to maintain the environment that we incarnate into.This level of knowledge has been taught either by those in control of,or the direction of,the education of the general population.As with most ancient information,though,it has been modified to suit the thought processes of those teachers involved at the time and/or the limitations of the language or individual educational levels.As a result the detail and clarity of the information we see today is the function of errors made over eons of time. As I sit here waiting to restart the dialogue with The Source Entity,I feel that this book may finish up being larger than anticipated.Why do I get this feeling,you may ask?You should know that this was going to be a big task,you say!Well,one would think that I would have learned by now that the task of helping to expose mankind to the next level of information was always going to be a hard one.For now,though,the answer is that I can see the structure of the multiverse unfold before my very eyes,and from what I can see,the hierarchy of those entities necessary to support its evolutionary efficiency is incredibly large,so large indeed that the detail given in the previous chapter feels wholly inadequate. Sometimes it is best to be given one's tasks in bite-sized chunks,without knowing the expected outcome of the final work.I mentally noted that in all of my other dialogues,this has been the case.I had been exposed to the bigger picture bit by bit,working on it-in a small and compacted way-even when I felt expanded to the point of being stretched to my elastic limit. But here,it was as if all the individual dialogues with the other eleven Source Entities and even The Origin itself were minor in comparison.I wondered why this was the case.Why did all that I have previously worked on feel smaller,when it was quite obviously bigger,certainly in exposure to the detail and concepts surrounding the entities and environments I had been in communication with?I had been exposed to unbelievable things way beyond the structure of the multiverse,a function of the isolated structure of Source Entity One,so,why,why,why did it feel so immense a task? SE1:You are getting old! ME:What? SE1:I thought that would grab your attention and get you out of your reverie. ME:OK,you have succeeded.I find myself here feeling very,very overexposed.I can't understand it,especially when I feel I have dealt with what I would consider larger,much larger subjects! SE1:I see.Let me explain and then we should stop pontificating and move on with the task at hand. ME:Thank you.It will be good to understand why I feel this way.

SE1:In all of the other dialogues with my peers and The Origin,you have been protected from the magnitude of what you have been dealing with.You have not been exposed to what you are working with in total.Not even in 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of the part you have worked with.This has been done to keep you stable. Irrespective of your energetic heritage,Mr.Om,you have to participate in the same way as those other Aspects who enter into the evolutionary cycle,and this means that you experience all of the limitations of incarnate existence,every one of them.In the energetic, all Aspects can understand and work with a much bigger picture,but experiencing the lowest of the frequencies of the multiverse,that which I have created for my creations to work with,is,for them and those who choose to experience such frequencies,a great leveler.The Om are no exception to this rule,in any Source Entity's environment.However, what you are feeling now is a function of two things.First,I am exposing you to more of the depth associated with what I am,and this is deeper in its expression to that which The Origin exposed you to in terms of its energies and environment.And second,there has been a drop in the base frequencies of the Earth over the last six years,which,although not noticeable at first,has culminated in a small but nevertheless more discernible knife-edge change at the start of 2016.This is why you are feeling the difference and the "trepidation" associated with this deeper level of exposure. ME:But how can you expose me to a deeper level of experience than The Origin? SE1:Because The Origin wants me to.Don't forget The Origin has had to work with your limitations as well and we all followed the same rules of engagement,so to speak.Now is the time for further expansion and this further expansion will harden you for the work you are destined to do during the dialogues to come,two new and yet-to-be-started books that will test you to your limits.Now it's time to describe my multiversal workforce.

## The Multiversal Hierarchy 

At last,at last,at last,I thought!I was starting to feel the energies and "knowingness" associated with channeling the information I wanted to know about.We are about to get down to the nitty-gritty.To be honest,dear reader,even though I had experienced these feelings of not knowing what is coming next in all of my books,I had been feeling more than a little anxious about not receiving any real information associated with the core subject matter associated with this book-that the information so far has just been padding,and that this book was slow in taking off,so to speak. SE1:Your desire to move on to the main subject matter straight away is blocking your ability to receive important peripheral information-and so you are missing it and are in danger of going in circles.You have become so used to the higher frequencies of The Origin and the love-based frequencies associated with working with Anne that working with me is,from an ego-based perspective,difficult to come down to.Also,you feel you know the subject-this also creates a block. Remember that everything is part of The Origin and should therefore be considered in the same light.Return to the desires,intentions,thoughts,and actions associated with being in the "now"and do not work on what you want.I will be,and am,giving you the subject headings associated with the material we will be discussing.Let me drive the creation of this book and you will be OK. Ifelt like I hadjust been reprimanded.

SE1:I wouldn't go so far as to say that,but,I would say that you needed to be realigned, to return to the original level of innocence and humility you had in the beginning of your spiritual work.Cast all doubts and low-frequency thoughts aside and return to being a pure channel. ME:Thank you.I will. I had to admit that with the growing demand for the information I have been receiving,I was trying to force the new information out.Without doubt,I was very uncomfortable with the levels of expectation from an information-hungry readership and the stress associated with my personal desire to deliver for them.To be able to back off and go with the old flow was liberating. SE1:Good.Let's get going. As you can imagine,and feel you know,there is a hierarchy associated with the work and the beings that maintain the structure and the function of the multiverse I created.I will describe them in brief before we go into the detail behind each level of structure and the class of being associated with the maintenance of it. The Curators is the overall description for those beings associated with the maintenance of the multiverse.This descriptor can be used for all levels of beings that we will discuss in short here and in greater detail later.

The Architects are those beings who work with making the environmental changes necessary to creating optimized evolutionary opportunity/ies.The roles of these beings are specific to all aspects of the multiversal environment. The Architects work on four levels:evolutionary demand,cause and effect,structure,and environmental requirements.They have a number of entities that assist them. They are stated below in no specific order: The Illustrators are the beings that work with the larger version of The Source's energetic memory that we call the Akashic records,one that encompasses all that our Source Entity has experienced through its own work and work with other Source Entities.The Akashic is a small segment of this interactive memory that relates to those beings that incarnate in the human form only.The Illustrators use the ability to interact with The Source's energetic memory to describe(illustrate)the different possibility scenarios that may be created by making changes to the structure of the multiverse or its local areas,whether new or modified. The Planners work with the Illustrators to effect a timely introduction of the decisions made as a result of the work of the Illustrators,ensuring that the chosen scenario is actioned in the "reality"chosen for it to exist within.They ensure that the changes are introduced in a seamless way. The Orchestrators control the work specified by the Planners.The Orchestrators operate at various levels associated with the work resulting from the activities of the Planners, operating a top-to-bottom approach to the management of the changes/creations required to be actioned. The Beginners(not to be confused with the human understanding of a beginning or start -see later)are a group of beings that work with the functions of Event Space allowing any changes to have its own "start of event."Those readers who are familiar with the terms and functions associated with Event Space will understand that everything exists in terms of events and not in terms of time.It is the job of the Beginners to ensure that the quality of the start of the event is maintained at its optimal level when introduced into the overall scheme of existing Event Space spaces.Note here that their insertion of change creates a whole new set of possibilities and as such the number of new Event Spaces,their fractals and the effects on the beings within these spaces needs to be known and managed by these entities. The Enders(not to be confused with the human understanding of an ending-see later) are a group of beings that work with the functions of Event Space allowing any changes to have its own "end of event."It is the job of the Enders to ensure that the quality of the end of the event is maintained at its optimal level when withdrawn from the overall scheme of existing Event Space spaces.Note here that their withdrawal creates a whole new set of possibilities and as such the number of new Event Spaces,their fractals and the effects on the beings within these spaces that would not be created needs to be known and managed by these entities.The end of an event can be created as a naturalized or forced function, whereas the start of an event,if created or managed by the Beginners,is a forced function only. The Deliverers are those beings who work on the functional side of the work of the Beginners and Enders.Their role can and does vary in any way associated with what they need to do.They are multidisciplined and are not specialized to any particular job,role,or responsibility. The Waymakers are quite possibly one of the most specialized group of beings we will work with in this dialogue,with of course the exception of those beings who work on the environmental functionality of a local environment or habitat(a planet,for instance).They ensure that the work of the Beginners and Enders has a seamless insertion and withdrawal point relative to the effects of all Event Spaces and their fractals.This means that they work on each parallel condition as it is created or uncreated to ensure that the changes experienced by the beings in these spaces are minimalized to the point of incoherence.This means that the beings themselves are not aware of the changes new parallel conditions create as they are affected by them. The Integrators do the ground work of the Waymakers.They are the beings that weave the different Events together into a seamless holographic state so that each Event Space is in contact with each other Event Space either directly or indirectly through direct and indirect contact with other Events. The Seed Makers are the creators of small events,very small events,which are capable of being inserted or withdrawn from the totality of Event Space without affecting those beings that are working within the normal functions of the Events themselves.They are called Seed Makers because the events they insert allow the creation of much bigger Events to be created on what appears to be a natural level,that being,as a natural fractal (later larger fractals)of an Event Space or Series of Event Spaces.This function can act in reverse as well where the withdrawal of an Event Space is seen as the natural demise of an Event Space resulting from it reaching its natural evolutionary conclusion. The Seeders work for the Seed Makers.Their role is to skillfully choose the Event Space/s in which to insert or withdraw the seed Event Space.If you like,they choose the moment of insertion.This role is not an easy one for the Seeders work with"What If"scenarios created by working with The Source's energetic memory and choosing the optimal moment of insertion or withdrawal. As with all entities that work with Event Space they have the capability of manipulating it Even though Event Space is a pan-Origin intelligent energy in its own right,those entities that absorb themselves in its functionality are eventually able to manipulate it. The Beleaguerers are a special group of entities because they are multifaceted and are skilled in all functions associated with the entities described so far and that will be described later. They look at the total workload to correct issues in terms of the total number of Event Spaces that could be affected if the wrong insertion point is used,or if the "What If" scenario function of The Source's energetic memory is incorrectly interpreted.Or indeed, anything that has responded in a way that was not expected or planned. The Beleaguerers are,or operate as,a firefighting and/or clean-up function when things don't go according to plan.They operate independently of all other entities and take over the operational corrections that are needed to ensure all Event Spaces and their junctures are maintained. The Recorders are exactly what their name describes them as-recorders.They work on the detail surrounding the work all of the other entities are responsible for and assign the actions of those entities working on the tasks they are recording and the subsequent responses of the components of the multiversal environments to the appropriate sectors of The Source's energetic memory. It does have to be said that the Recorders work specifically on recording the information associated with the work of The Source's maintenance entities and not The Source itself. The Interfacers are a group of entities that link everything together.They see the ways in which to dovetail the work of one set of entities to the work of another set of entities. Although it could be argued that all entities are able to experience all things simultaneously and therefore understand the functionality surrounding the potential to link one piece of work with another;that the work of the Interfacers is not required. However,when we consider the complexities surrounding the maintenance of any part of the multiverse and those parallel environments that could,can,and will be created,there is a need for entities to specialize.Understanding the opportunities,ways,and methods of linking the work of other entities together is therefore complicated at best and requires focus to ensure seamless integration. The Initiators(not to be confused with Beginners)are those entities that decide what modifications are needed to either maintain the evolutionary efficiency of an environment, or create modifications to introduce a completely different set of evolutionary opportunities.One way to describe them would be to use the term "Brain Stormers."In this role,the Initiators therefore create the new ideas that are eventually actioned as new environments,experiences,and evolutionary opportunities. The Observers(not to be confused with Recorders)exist within the environments that all entities maintain or create.Their role is to experience the creations of those entities that create the structure,environments that exist within the structure,and the components of an environment.The Observers experience the creations of other entities by observing the way in which those entities that are creating,create and those entities that chose to experience those creations experience them.They achieve this in a number of ways but the main way is to place themselves within the energies of the experiencing entity and observe the experience in the same way as the creating or experiencing entity but from the benefit of being both inside and outside of the creation and/or experience. The Producers create the energies that allow small changes or creations to be made.One should not look at this as being a small role,however,as the small changes are those that deal with the minute detail of changes or creations.It is the small changes that need the most attention to detail and so the energies need to contain all of the detailed information based upon a template to support those smaller changes.As an example of what I mean here,you should consider this as being the energies that support the structure that allows the generation of the smallest components within the physical universe,which in this instance is the Anu. The Generators generate the "form"from energies,the structure that is created by the Producers.In this instance,one should think of the Generators being downstream of the Producers for they take the energies created by the Producers and generate the templates for the creation and stability of those components used in the creation of the lower frequency environments.In this instance,this would be all of the aspects of the physical universe represented by its twelve frequential levels. The Environmentalists are the entities that you as human beings may be more interested in because they deal with the creation of,manipulation of,and maintenance of the environmental aspects of the multiversal structure,that being the environments that we use to evolve in from an "immersed"perspective.They include the following roles: The Universalists are those entities that maintain,create,and support the local structure and overall content of the frequencies that are capable of supporting a universal environment,one where many areas of habitude can be created.They are the creators of the components within a particular universe that give the incumbent entities the opportunity to create within the local environments that which the universe allows to be created with those components.In essence,they create the environments for the Habitation Creators to work with,giving them their raw materials.These raw materials are galaxies,nebulae, planets,and moons from the perspective of the physical universe. The Parallelism Engineers work with the results of,or the effects of,the interaction with Event Space.They draw the line between the local,planetary,system,galactic,and universal-sized Event Spaces that are created by the decisions,possible decisions,the possibility of possible decisions,and the possibility of the possibility of possible decisions. The line they draw is the demarcation between these different Event Spaces and their location to each other in terms of their "potential"to be in existence versus their actual existence which includes the closeness of deviation from the main line Event Space and each other.Their main role is therefore to ensure there is adequate separation between these Event Spaces ensuring that where there needs to be simple separation,there is simple separation,and when there can be "crossover"between Event Spaces by the incumbent entities,that this function is in operation. The Concurrence Engineers are those entities that look at the relationship between each of the universes created within the frequencies of the multiverse.They ensure that the functionality of these universes is maintained.They ensure that they are within the same space and that as a result of being in the same space that they exist independently of each other.They also ensure that the progression from one universe to another is both robust and reasonable;the way I describe the universes created for use within the multiverse is as being "self-contained simultaneous universes."So,as stated above,"concurrence" is a function of being in the same space but with the added function of being in an evolutionary flow,a flow which all universes within the multiverse have-that is specific to the static structure of the multiverse.The Concurrence Engineers can and do work with the Frequential Barrier Engineers [see below-GSN]. It must be noted here that the Concurrence Engineers do not work on those universes that are created in parallel with the self-contained simultaneous universes.They do not work on those universes that are created by Event Space interactions because they are specialized to work on a stable multiversal environment and not a transient one. The Frequential Barrier Engineers work in conjunction with the Concurrence Engineers. They ensure that there is a,for want of a better word,"gap"between the frequencies that allows a demarcation between one self-contained simultaneous universe to another.This may seem out of tune with the current understanding of "physics"but there can be and are gaps between what I call major frequencies,or to describe it a better way,a gap between the top of the bandwidth of one major frequency and the bottom of the bandwidth of another higher major frequency.These gaps are also part of the supporting structure of the multiverse and not the functional aspect of it.One way to think of how this works is to consider placing a sign on one rung of a ladder,missing out the one rung above it,and placing another "progressive"sign on the rung two rungs above the first rung where the first sign was placed.It is therefore the role of these entities to ensure that the gap of one rung of the ladder is maintained. The Attractionists have two distinct specialisms.In the first distinction,they are entities that specialize in working in the physical aspects of the multiverse.They specifically work on the way in which the energies that are associated with the lowest frequencies can and are used in conjunction to each other.In simple terms,they work on the "strength"or level of attraction between each other,or put in another way,their gravity.The Attractionists work on all levels of "physical bodies,"from the attraction between Anu to the larger attraction between planets,suns,solar systems,and galaxies. In the second specialism,they work on the signature of energies that are used to ensure that incarnates are attracted to each other for the purposes of removing karmic links or working together on a common life plan.This is not the same as being attracted from a romantic perspective because it is a functional aspect of the interactive evolutionary process of entities that are working with the evolutionary cycle. The Caretakers is the overall name for those entities that work within the frequencies of the physical universe.This is where most of the entities that incarnate mankind has knowledge about,such as Elementals (nature spirits)and Angels,reside.It includes the Attractionists above and the following roles below. The Vehicle Creators are those entities that design and create the vehicles used for experiencing the lowest frequencies of the multiverse that we call the physical universe in the way it is supposed to be experienced.That means that an incarnating entity experiences resistance,lack of functionality,and connectivity.These are the entities that I described in your book,The History of God,and they can and do include members of the genre of energies of entities I call incarnate mankind.There are a group of these entities that are the collective creational mind,so to speak,for every vehicle that allows a level of incarnate interaction to be achieved within the environment they were designed for.This includes all of the twelve frequencies associated with the physical universe and the frequential representations of the vehicles created for those frequencies.From the perspective of mankind's understanding,all types of flora and fauna can be used for incarnate experience. Just before your readers ask the question about insects,which I will discuss in detail later,a single TES Aspect would be in control of a whole hive and not one specific insect. The Habitation Creators deal with the ability for the environment to support the perpetuation and reproduction of the incarnate vehicles created for a specific environment or environments.For instance,they understand the work of the Atmospherisists [see below -GSN]and introduce either existing flora and fauna or suggest the creation of new flora and fauna to the Vehicle Creators as appropriate whose very existence helps to support the balance of the environment in an automatic way.The Habitation Creators also include the Habitation Specialists. The Habitation Specialists are those entities that incarnate mankind calls nature spirits. They work as a specialized function,so much so,that they may even be aligned to a single plant or microbe.It does have to be said here that even though animals and plants are classified as incarnate vehicles for the use of certain genres of TES Aspect or un- projected TES (those TES that either have no currently projected Aspects or have not generated any Aspects to project)that they would still be in need of care and attention from the Habitation Specialists.Additionally,and in some instances,the TES who projects an Aspect or Aspects into the animal vehicle may be working directly with,or under the direction of,the Habitation Specialists that are responsible for a specific animal or plant vehicle. The Atmospherisists are a group of entities that work with the stability of the wider environment,planetary or otherwise,and how it is used by the incarnate vehicle and supporting infrastructure it is designed for.They modify and manipulate the functions of the atmosphere and its periods of change relevant to the location of the planet or environment.A planet is not the only location for an incarnate vehicle to work within and neither is the need for aspiration to ensure bodily function within the location and frequency it resides within always necessary. The Populationists are the flora and fauna engineers.They have various levels of responsibility-each specialized according to the environment they are working with.The environment can be universal,galactic,systematic,planetary-includes moons or nebulae based as habitable environments.They work in close harmony with the Atmospherisists, who provide the details behind the atmosphere they are creating or able to create with the materials they have.The Populationists then create the basic mechanical vehicles that are used for those entities that are incarnate for the purposes of being a "living"functional aspect of the atmosphere,so to speak. Guides and Helpers [these are described in The Anne Dialogues-GSN]should not be confused with those entities described in summary above as being relevant to the maintenance of the multiversal environment.They are specific to the assistance of those entities that enter into the evolutionary cycle and use the lower frequencies of the multiverse as an evolutionary accelerant. ME:This is all very good in summary,AND I know that we are going to describe these entities in detail later on in this dialogue.But I do have one question,one that a lot of my readers will want to know. SE1:And that is? ME:Why do we refer to some of these beings as Angels?Where did the description,or should I say,the use of the word Angel and their roles and responsibilities come from? SE1:We have already discussed this to some extent at the very start of this dialogue,but I will see if I can make it plainer. Each of the entities described in your short appraisal of the currently understood (and with a largely Christian bias,I note)hierarchy of those entities who are closest to me, are the result of the spiritual knowledge,intellectual capacity,and energetic ability of the incarnates of those periods when they were described.Also note that,in reading your thoughts,those incarnates that were capable of either understanding what they were seeing or were being exposed to "information-wise"were given the information in ways that they would be able to work with and move on with.When those incarnates that were being communicated with offered an explanation or description that they expressed as being some level of understanding of what they had been given was considered to be progressive they were allowed to use that information.The issue here is that this understanding was only for the illustrative purposes of one person-the person being communicated with and should not have been used for the education of others of either lesser or greater knowledge.It is the variance in understanding,or schools of thought, and the subsequent disagreements that cause the creation of one way versus another and aggression between these schools of thought,for all schools think that they are correct and the others are not.The fact of the matter is that none of them is correct to the point where they know the absolute truth about the subject they are broadcasting,they can't,because they don't have the intellectual and educational capacity and neither do they have the frequential level that supports the ability to access higher knowledge. So,getting to the question,the word Angel is a descriptor for those entities that are disincarnate and as a result "pure"from the perspective of the incarnate.It has been misused and used as a description of those entities that communicate issues of guidance to certain incarnates-which of course are the Guides and Guides'Helpers.Even the name given has been misused and used as a means of describing the environment they exist within-that being the Angelic-you will see what I mean later. ME:Where does the use of the word“Arch”come from in the descriptor“Archangel?”SE1:This is a function of the use of the human languages and the desire for a structure to exist.Based upon this I suggest you look at the word "hierarchy"and break it down to two words-Higher(Hier)and Arch(Archy).Incarnates like to see things in a structured way, so,until they can see in a concurrent way-i.e.,everything existing all at the same time and at the same level in a total unstructured and amorphous way,I and those who help in the education of truth seekers will give them structure.The words "Higher"and "Arch" together can be used to describe the graduations in the frequencies."Higher"meaning above the current location of one location or entity within a location,and "Arch"is a way of describing a frequential level as being above the current,as an arch or bridge over to the next level. "Arch"as a descriptor for an individual is a Greek word and it means "leader,ruler,or chief. In another way,it is a method of saying an individual is above or higher than another. Angel as a descriptor for an individual is a Greek word and it means "messenger."In another way it is a method of saying an individual is a bringer of news or is an educator. Neither of these descriptors should be used to describe the maintenance entities if used in this context,but they can be used to describe Guides and Helpers.Guides and Helpers do not,however,have the same roles as those entities that are involved in the maintenance of the multiversal structure,and those that do are either classified as Elementals and are not in a position of giving messages to incarnate mankind,or are involved at a level where they are never in contact with incarnates. ME:Based upon this then,the use of the words "Angel"and "Archangel"cannot be used as a descriptor for any entity that is involved in the guidance of incarnate TES Aspects or maintenance entities of any level. SE1:Correct.There is one level of description where it can be used,though,and one where the visual descriptions fit in with history,to a certain level,that is.

ME:Pray tell me,I am all ears! SE1:You are aware of the ability for a higher frequency incarnate to create a secondary incarnation,so that the Aspect involved in the "primary"and higher frequency incarnation can experience two incarnations concurrently,one of a higher frequency and the other of a lower frequency. ME:I am.It is described in The Anne Dialogues. SE1:Well,this can also be used to allow the higher frequency incarnate to exist within a lower frequency civilization and,when the timing is right,make changes that will improve the education,knowledge,and technology of the lower frequency incarnate civilization through the communicational opportunity that is created by the higher frequency incarnate Aspect advising its lower frequency Aspect what to do and when to do it.Because they are a higher frequency,they would normally be invisible to the lower frequency incarnate Aspect.However,they would be able to,by the use of certain energetic technology,make themselves "visible"to their lower frequency incarnate Aspect and give them direction.They would be messengers to themselves-their own Angel or Archangel! This should work as an explanation for you. ME:It does,and I was feeling a little uncomfortable about the use of the word Angel and the historical descriptions of them.In these few short sentences,you have put my concerns to bed.Thank you.

SE1:Good,this method is actually quite common and is an explanation for the reports of "God's"messengers that removes a link with Guides,Helpers,and multiversal maintenance entities because it is all maintained within the one universal environment.

## The Devil Is in the Detail 

Having just summarized the roles of God's helpers,I was starting to feel that I would be telling the story again,so to speak.I was feeling a little bit unsure about this process and was worrying about the expectations of the readers in terms of the religious expectations of these entities versus what I have been exposed to over the last few months and weeks. For those of you who have read my previous books,you will be somewhat surprised that I am thinking in this way.I may have looked like I was supremely confident in my ability to communicate with The Source Entity/ies and The Origin and the detail surrounding the concepts,environments,and entities discussed.I am of course very confident in this respect and I am also aware that this can seem like arrogance.I tell you it is not and I am always concerned about how best to validate the information I am exposed to.That said,being told that one of the most memorable descriptions of the betrayal of God,including the name of the betrayer, illustrated within religious texts is basically a human creation,is going to shake a few trees.It was,in my mind,a difficult and world-shattering responsibility to have. After some time of contemplation,and a need to clear my mind of a conflict in terms of the nomenclature used,I decided to put my money where my mouth is and ask a very simple but poignant question-that being,"can I/we use the names in the Bible as useful descriptors?" SE1:NO! ME:That was a quick answer.

SE1:You both wanted and needed one that was definitive. ME:Well,you sure have given me one.I have another question,though. SE1:Yes. ME:I was thinking that maybe I would work with you in providing some sort of reference or link between what you advise me and how it links into the current religious and sometimes spiritual-based knowledge. SE1:That would not be wise. ME:Why can't I/we use the names in the Bible? SE1:Simply because they are incorrect in terms of their visual and functional description. Incarnate mankind still thinks that it is the only sentient being in the physical universe,let alone the local galaxy the Earth is located within,and this interpretation has transplanted from religious texts,so,Angels are in incarnate human form as a result.Your work will provide a platform-as always-to allow the readers to un-learn this constant need to refer to the incarnate human form as a one-size-fits-all form factor.Now,though,it is the time to achieve the same thing by removing the reference to Angels and their human form. ME:So where do we start then? SE1:At the very top of the hierarchy,those entities that we discussed at the beginning. Please note,though,that I use the word "hierarchy"loosely here because in real terms, there is no such thing as a hierarchy of entities that maintain the functions of the multiverse. ME:You mean that they don't exist or that they are equal? SE1:Both.The focus of sentient energy that is your TES and you as a smaller aspect of your TES work for the benefit of the accelerated expansion of the evolutionary content of that sentience.As such,you and your TES are small,veryvery small individualized and therefore specialized units of The Origin.You therefore ARE The Origin,as am I from a greater or larger perspective.Looking at this from a different angle,you and your TES are so infinitesimally small in comparison with The Origin in its current and future forms that you don't exist.In essence then,you and I are just Origin energy with sentience-our existence being a loose function of the individuality assigned to that sentience we call us. This thought process can and should also be used for those entities that help maintain the structure of the multiverse within my particular set of individualized sentient energies,for everything is one and everything is amorphous in functionality.For the moment,though, we shall refer to these specific individualizations of sentient energy as my helpers-my multiversal maintenance entities,and not as functions of,shall I say,"order"within that which is order-less and amorphous.This is for another day,though,and another series of dialogues,not specifically with me,I might add.It might not even be with you,but with another who can take the work further. ME:Yes,I already know that others,those who are more expansive than me,will take over and push the boundaries further.Before we start,though,I have just picked up on one of the words that you used. SE1:Yes? ME:You stated that,and I will generalize here,that everything seems to be order-less and amorphous.Surely,The Origin,that is,its sentient energies,are or have order and structure? SE1:In reality,they are largely structure-less and order-less.If they had structure,shall I say with ultimate structure,then The Origin could not function in a way that is efficient enough to allow its functionality as an Omni-present,Omniscient being to be Omni- functional. The presentation of "all that is"as having a structure is,for the most part,for the benefit of incarnate mankind.You will move away from the need to use these terms and thought processes when you are close to ending the need to incarnate to accelerate your evolutionary progress. ME:So,just calling a point of order here then.Why don't we simply miss out the middle man of presenting things in an orderly structure-based way that is controlled and maintained by a hierarchy of entities to one where we deal with a structure-less amorphous condition?

SE1:Because incarnate mankind would not be able to understand the mechanics and functionality of such a condition.Remember your own words to your readers,"You can't feed steak to a baby when it is feeding on milk,and you can't expect someone who barely understands the multiplication tables to work out matrix multiplication-based equations."We have to start somewhere and we have to educate,while in the incarnate state,in a logical and progressive way.

So,we will continue with the use of the descriptions summarized earlier as a starting point for the deeper levels of detail associated with those individualized units of sentient energies that are my multiversal maintenance entities. ME:Thank you.Let's start from the top then.

## From the Top 

Now that we are getting down to the nitty-gritty of the detail behind those entities that dedicate themselves to the functionality of the multiverse,I feel like I am getting in the flow again.I fully intended to start each section with the summary for each entity that was provided to me by the Source,and I still do.For some reason,I keep receiving the standard presentation format in my head,"tell the audience what you are going to tell them,tell the audience,then tell the audience what you told them!"It seems very clinical but it does make sure that the information is understood.I don't think I will take it to its n'th degree but I do want to refresh our memories of the basics before I delve into the detail for each of the entities and their roles. Itjust feels necessary somehow and is something that I have not felt before when channeling the information. I stopped a moment to sink into myself to understand where this feeling was coming from.I noticed resistance,not from me but from an indoctrinated public.In my previous work I have been,in general,too far away from the vagaries of religion to be concerned,with spiritual physics and metaphysics being a distance apart in most people's minds.In my understanding spiritualism and metaphysics is generally accepted by religious people with no particular attention being placed upon the subjects that are discussed under these headings-because they feel that it doesn't affect them.Here,though,I was delving into the periphery of popular religion irrespective of who the originating teacher is,for most religions refer to God's helpers in some way.

The Curators As stated previously,this name is a useful descriptor for all of the entities that are involved in the maintenance and functionality of the multiversal environment that our creator, The Source Entity,made for us as smaller individualized units of its sentient energy to experience itself in greater depth and detail,evolving for,and on its behalf,in the process. SE1:That's not all,though. ME:You have some additional information to share with me,I take it? SE1:Yes,of course.You need to be aware that there are a number of entities that are overseers,so to speak.They look after each of the full dimensions that are the basis for the higher aspect of the multiversal structure,that part of me that I have reserved for my creations,my smaller parts of me,to experiment with. ME:Is there one for each of the full dimensions?What I mean is,is there one entity that is responsible for the first full dimension and another for the second full dimension? SE1:Not in the way you describe it and not in the way you are thinking.In essence, there are twelve,so you are correct in one part of your thinking.However,they are not specifically responsible for a particular full dimension per se,moreover they are collectively responsible for all full dimensions and their substructures and functionality. ME:Are they what we call the Council of Twelve?

SE1:No,no,no.Spiritualists are so obsessed with this so-called Council,it's become a distraction.In reality,there is no such formality,although in function you may be forgiven for thinking in this way.You see,they work as a higher function of those who are from the overall perspective classified as a Curator,as for example,the Curators'Curator. ME:Hang on a moment.I am starting to understand what you are eluding to here. SE1:I haven't said much to allow you to establish what I am alluding to yet.Suffice to say, though,you are picking up on the way these entities work and distribute themselves. ME:What do you mean,distribute themselves? SE1:Go ahead-describe what you are seeing in your mind's eye! I did.What I saw was interesting.I could see that The Source had created twelve entities. Each of these twelve were distributed in a way that I had seen before.It wasn't distribution in terms of being spread out,but more in terms of individualized sentient energies.Each of the twelve were displaying the principal method that a True Energetic Self or TES(sometimes called the Godhead,Oversoul,or Higher Self)would use if it were projecting part or parts of itself into the lower frequencies of the multiversal environment for experiential and evolutionary purposes.These twelve Curators or Curators'Curators were not just partially projected,but they were fully projected into the full one hundred and forty-four possible projections.Twelve projections with each projection or"Aspect"having twelve smaller projections or "Shards!"Were they just another TES doing another role,a different role,one that was as far upstream as an individualized aspect of Source Entity sentient energy could go without being in communion with their Source?I was beginning to think so! SE1:Very well done,and of course they are.All of my individualizations,all of my creations that are involved in the evolutionary cycle and its supporting structure at your level-that is,incarnate mankind's level-are the same in sentience,energy,and structure. ME:So,irrespective of whether an entity is at its highest level,TES level,in the evolutionary cycle or the service-based system/structure-whatever,they are the same basic expression of you in individuality? SE1:Correct.Being in the evolutionary cycle you all have certain ways to use your individualization and your ability to distribute certain aspects of that individuality that are relevant to the work you are doing.Each of the twelve "Curator"-based entities operate in a state of maximum distribution all of the time.This is the most efficient way for them to operate-that being,all working collectively and all working fully distributed,or projected. So,if you want to understand why I called them the Curators'Curator,it's because their projections,and ultimately those of the other individualized TES that are working with other levels of structure and work are the Curators "in general"and the TES of the twelve are the Curators of the Curators.I would like to note here that their TES being described as the Curators of the Curators is not an expression of higher responsibility or status,it is simply a way of describing how they are distributed and how they work in a way that you and your readers will understand. ME:One more quick question before we move onto the subject of the Architects.

SE1:Carry on. ME:When in the evolutionary cycle our TES projects its Aspects,and the Aspects project Shards to allow the opportunity for diversified individualization,which results in multiple and separate experience and evolutionary growth of the TES concurrently,discounting,of course,these parallel conditions created by Event Space and our invocation of it through individual choice at certain experiential junctures-does it not? SE1:Yes,it does. ME:Is this the same for the TES of the Curators'Curators and their projections? SE1:No,it's a different method of functioning.When the Aspects of the Curators'TES and the Shards of the Aspects for the Curators'TES are projected,they are not individualized in the same way as those in the evolutionary cycle.In essence,they are working in a collective way with the same functions as each other but with different multiversal responsibilities,that is not to say that they have different roles.Roles are not responsibilities and responsibilities do not create roles.The projection of the Curators'TES is simply a way of increasing their ability to connect with everything they need to connect with in an efficient way. I was starting to see a picture of how this might work.Each of these twelve Curators'Curators were linked together in a form of matrix.Within this matrix,which by the way I am taking as being a humanized version of what the actual functionality was,every Shard,Aspect,and TES were interconnected in such a way where each of them were both a representation of each other in every connection with each other and each juncture within the multiversal structure.I was trying to visualize how this might work when The Source decided that it would be able to give a better description. SE1:You are seeing the interconnectivity of the Curators'Curators in a very low-frequency way,a very basic way;in a way which is from your readers'perspective three-dimensional. In reality,there is no such description for they are interconnected in a multistructural way that is above and beyond the structure of the multiversal that is used in the evolutionary cycle. ME:What do you mean,multistructural? SE1:By now you should have worked out that what you experience in your temporary low- frequency existence is not what is experienced in the Greater Reality. ME:Give me some latitude here please.I am not just asking the questions for myself,but for the readers as well.I understand that there are ways in which we work and experience things from the perspective of a being in the evolutionary cycle and there are ways in which we work and experience things from the perspective of a being in service to those in the evolutionary cycle.I am also aware that my/our ability to comprehend what we are being given is based upon our current experience and knowledge and that what we will be exposed to later is a result of our growth,resulting from previous levels of exposure. SE1:Forgive me;I was being critical of your line of questioning.I will explain further then.

ME:Thank you. SE1:You see,the Curators'Curators have a special function.It is to not only be the highest point of the hierarchy from a structural support perspective,but they themselves create the conditions necessary to allow the multiversal structure to exist. ME:You're saying that the Curators'Curators are the structure of the multiverse? SE1:No,I am saying that they create the conditions necessary for its existence. ME:But I thought,I should say that my understanding was/is that you made the multiverse out of your own energies? SE1:And I did. ME:So why do you need these beings to maintain its need to be in existence? SE1:Simply put,to maintain its continued existence by being the prime motivating force behind my desire to evolve through the creation of individualized smaller aspects of my sentience who will work without direct interaction with the greater part of my sentience that remains intact.My desire to progress and evolve is a prime function of my creation by my creator,The Origin,and as such this desire to progress and evolve is infused throughout my sentience,irrespective of whether it is whole,part of the remaining whole,or an individualized aspect of that part of me that was taken from the whole and divided up. ME:So our desire to evolve is a function of your desire to evolve,which is a function of The Origin's desire to evolve. SE1:Correct.And,although the original manifestation of the multiverse and of my creation of smaller individualized aspects of my sentience was the result of my desire to accelerate my evolution,this desire to maintain an environment to evolve within is embedded within my creations as well. ME:So the Curators in general maintain the desire for the existence of the multiverse,and those beings that elected to be in the evolutionary cycle maintain their desire for their use of the multiverse and its continued existence and maintenance of its evolutionary efficiency by the Curators.The one giving the desire for the continued existence of the other maintains the continued existence of themselves in the process. SE1:Correct.It's a self-contained,self-perpetuating system that no longer needs my desire for its existence to continue its existence because the desire of those entities that use it want it to remain in existence and therefore create its continued existence and indeed the continuation of their individualization in the process. ME:And the Curators'Curators are at the top of the perpetuation of this particular desire. SE1:Yes,they are.To use your computer language as a description,they are the internal operating system of the multiverse.Not only do they maintain the overall structure,they create,through the desire of those beings in the evolutionary cycle,the overall intention behind the continuation of the multiverse by being the structure behind the multiverse and its operating system.

I was considering the information I had just been given and what it meant.No more than twelve entities,twelve individualized units of The Source Entities'sentient energy were used, or elected to be the creative desire behind the structure of the multiverse.The Curators' Curators were not only the highest level of entity within the hierarchy of those beings that maintained the multiverse and its evolutionary efficiency from the perspective of an entity that was in the evolutionary cycle,they both created and were the highest level of structure of the multiverse itself.This realization suddenly gave birth to another realization,that being, that the multiverse itself was sentient by default.The third realization came quickly.Of course the multiverse was sentient,it was part of The Source,which,was part of The Origin. Although I inherently knew this,I hadn't appreciated it and therefore thought about it on an intellectual level.Why we as incarnate human beings are unable to see what is right in front of us,even when it is presented to us in flashing lights,is astonishing,and in this previous lack of intellectual realization of mine,I had astonished myself.It all seemed so logical now and taking the thought process based upon my recent realization a little further down the line made me very aware that we,even as beings or entities that are in the multiverse as units of individualized sentient energy with free will,are also a fundamental part and function of what is created by The Source to assist in its evolutionary progression.Not only are we individualized sentient energy but we are our own creation and the environmental condition that supports our creation and creativity. I suddenly stopped myself in my tracks and posed a question to myself.If it is truly the case that we are both created and creator and environment for that which can be created,what is the point of discussing the roles,responsibilities,and functions of those entities called The Curators?Essentially from a logical perspective I/we are them and they are I/us and therefore considering that we may have created each other then there is no need for any entities to govern that which we are and have created in an environment that is us as well.My mind reeled for a moment at this prospect.I had long ago started to feel that everything was amorphous,but now I was getting the proof.I was starting to wonder if I should jump to a different level,one where everything was amorphous and report about that when The Source took over my thoughts and gave me direction. SE1:It's too early for a dialogue based upon a higher level of understanding.You need to work on what is being used as a medium for evolutionary progression rather than the ultimate function of who and what you all are. ME:What do you mean? SE1:I will put it in a simple way.Everything that you know,work with,and create is real; it is part of this reality and this includes the structure of the multiverse and the functions of those entities that are it,create it,and operate within it.It also includes the information that was given to you by my peers and The Origin.However,it is also true that everything is amorphous but that which is amorphous has decided to experience structure.This is where you all come in.You are the amorphous that has created the non-amorphous -structure.In wanting to experience structure you have all created structure within a structure that I have given you all to work with.

ME:But I thought you told me that you created the multiverse and populated it with smaller versions of yourself by individualizing units of your sentient energies to populate it and that the structure was already there as a division of yourself? SE1:It is and was.You need to know this.My division of self to create all the different genres of TES is a true statement of what did,has,and is happening.The structure of the multiverse however was given to you all as an idea,a blueprint of what could be.You all decided to perpetuate that idea and modify it to suit your own ideas on what the structure should/could be and how it should be supported and how it should be utilized to its best capacity as an evolutionary medium.And that is how,in a nutshell,the structure of the multiverse,its maintainability,and population came about. ME:Everything is a stage then,a creation by ourselves for ourselves for the benefit of our progression. SE1:Correct.There is no conundrum between considering the higher function of what you all are,amorphous and one,and the condition of what you are temporarily,structured and individualized. ME:I get the feeling that everything is a gigantic game in creation and experience.

SE1:Of course it is,but the game has a desire or reason to be an expected outcome- experiential and evolutionary progression. You can now progress with your work on this book knowing that,although there is a deeper understanding of the reason for the structure,maintenance,population,and function of the multiverse,its current condition needs to be understood and used as a tool for personal expansion before working with the amorphous while in a structured state. ME:I expect that this will be the subject matter for discussion in future dialogues? SE1:Yes,it will,and when the time,the Event Space,is in place for this to happen,you will be drawn to communicate with The Origin about it. ME:It's time to move on to the next level of entities,the Architects. SE1:Yes,it is.

## The Architects 

My mind had been put to rest.I now understood,finally,that the amorphous and the structured exist together as afunction ofeach other and are not separate and in conflict.Those aware and awake incarnate individuals who pick up only the amorphous or the structure and report about it are not in conflict with each other either,for both are correct,both exist in the same space and both are a function of each other.Within the amorphous,it is those units of individualized sentient energy,the amorphous given structure,The Source Entities, and their creations,that have,in turn,created structure from the amorphous to experience the amorphous in a way that it is not-structured.The result of the collaboration between creator and the created,to create within that which is created creates further creations and the ultimate need to govern those creations that created the need for further structure and the entities to govern that structure and those entities that have the desire to use it and delve deep into the minutest detail.This is where the need for the roles and responsibilities for the governing entities raised and why I am here waiting to receive the information to describe the next level of governing entities-the Architects. ME:Now that I have given the readers and myself a wider understanding of why the multiverse "is"a structure within a structure (you)within that which is amorphous but gaining structure,of a sort(The Origin),I am confident in my ability to understand the information in the way you present it to me and I can present it to the readers. SE1:Good,so you should.You have been working with me,my peers,and our creator for long enough to be supremely confident in this information and even gain the information direct,in lieu of through a third party such as me.I know you have been working on a higher personal level and have had trouble with integrating the structure with the amorphous from an intellectual perspective,and this is to be understood.While in the incarnate,the ability for the Aspect to work in more than one conceptual way is difficult at best,especially when two concepts seem to be in variance with each other from your human perspective. ME:Thank you.To be honest I was starting to think I was losing it a little. SE1:You are not losing it in the slightest.You are just moving from one level of understanding to another,one where everything is possible and everything is in actuality Getting back to the work at hand,though.I gave you a summary that stated that the Architects are those beings who work with making the environmental changes necessary to creating optimized evolutionary opportunity/ies.The roles of these beings are specific to all aspects of the multiversal environment.I also conveyed to you that the Architects work on four levels:evolutionary demand,cause and effect,structure,and environmental requirements.They have a number of entities that assist them,which we will discuss in their own right later. With the Architects functioning on each of the four levels,the multiverse receives an absolute reason for its existence,the reason being a function of the desire of those entities in the evolutionary cycle wanting it to continue to support their work in the most efficient way possible.The Architects therefore work on the four areas of major structural influence from a high-level perspective,leaving the detail to those entities that work on their behalf.That being said,they are ultimately responsible for the work of those supporting entities and as a result,they create the main focus for the work of their supporting entities by ensuring that the four main levels of the multiverse they work with are maintained from a strategic perspective that is consistent with the requirements of each and every one of those entities that are in the evolutionary cycle. ME:Hold on a minute!Are you suggesting that the multiverse is modified to suit the requirements of each of the individual entities that are in the evolutionary cycle? SE1:Yes,of course. ME:Let me clarify my comment here for the benefit of the readers.What I mean is that the multiverse is actually modified in line with the evolutionary requirements of each entity in the evolutionary cycle on an individual basis and not on an overall,general,or collective basis? SE1:Correct. ME:I,and I hope I speak for the readers here,was under the assumption that the multiverse was a general environment that we,or should I say our TES,experiences,via its projected Aspects and/or Shards to enable a greater level of understanding of the multiverse through the use of myriad entities experiencing the same thing.I did not see that the multiverse was modified to suit the needs of the individual.

SE1:Well,it is. ME:Well then,in my limited understanding this means that every one of us in the evolutionary cycle has their own multiverse to work with. SE1:You cannot include yourself in that statement because you are not in the evolutionary cycle. ME:What?I thought I must be,simply because I am here,in your energies,incarnate in the lowest of the frequencies of your energies. SE1:No,you are not,and now is not the time to enter into this type of dialogue. ME:When do I get the chance to discuss it then? SE1:In the book that records the dialogue you will have,have had,are having with the OM. ME:And that will be in...? SE1:It will be in two books'time,including this book.After this dialogue you need to help others heal themselves and introduce an energetic reason for why incarnate human beings experience physical and psychological dysfunction and how it can be healed.This will need to be presented to the medical and psychological fraternity as an alternative,but necessary healing modality. ME:But I don't need to worry about that dialogue nor the dialogue about the OM and I being outside,as you say,of the evolutionary cycle right now.

SE1:No,not yet.You will know when to-you always do. ME:OK,getting back to this concept that... SE1:It's not a concept,it's actuality. ME:...OooKaay-the function of... SE1:That's better. ME:You're welcome!...Getting back to the function of the multiverse as an environment that is tailored or individualized to the needs of the individualized entity then,does this mean that,to all intents and purposes,the other entities we experience and interact with are not really in existence? SE1:Yes and no. ME:Would you care to elaborate? SE1:Of course.The multiverse allows the creation of "temporary"interactions,the entities and environment/s to support it,and the interaction of other entities in the evolutionary cycle and their individualized aspect of the multiverse to work together concurrently. ME:Is this a function of Event Space? SE1:No,this is not a function of Event Space;it is a function of multiversal fluidity and adaptability.However,and this is a big however,this needs to be managed and maintained on a scale the size of all the entities that are in the evolutionary cycle and that is the collective role of the Curators at all levels of responsibility.Those responsibilities are what we are trying to discuss now. As The Source Entity was talking,my mind wandered back to a concept that Dolores Cannon presented in the 2014 Ozark Mountain Publishing Transformation Conference.She talked about the existence of "Back Drop"people.I had presented the concept of "Back Fill"people and she was excited about the name used.It seemed to be used to describe the same advent of temporary or transient individuals that were created by us all to "fill in"the gaps in the background of our existence and experience,just like the painted image at the back of a stage to depict a location or place during a play.As it happened,the names were used to describe entirely different things but right now the concept of "Back Drop"suddenly made clear sense. SE1:Now you're getting it. ME:But it seems incredible that each TES,each Aspect,and each Shard has its own multiverse to work with! SE1:It may seem incredible but from where I am standing,so to speak,the incredible is just simply part of the boring detail. ME:This is why I like this job,there is always something new to keep me interested,to stretch me beyond my capacity-and more.

SE1:This is what you came here for,to experience being stretched and passing on the reasons for,and the product of,being stretched to the wider incarnate public,so to speak. Now,though,we have digressed enough.We need to move on to the four levels of function that the Architects are responsible for. Evolutionary Demand SE1:As you are now aware,the multiverse is tailored specifically to the demands of the evolutionary requirements of each and every entity within the evolutionary cycle. ME:So I see,and just thinking about the interconnectivity of all of these individualized versions of the multiverse together with the added complexity of the different Event Spaces we create as a result of our individual and collective choices is hurting my head. This is getting more convoluted by the minute! SE1:Well,there is more to come,but,it has to be the right juncture in incarnate mankind's existence and your ability and/or others to assimilate the information. ME:That is so very well understood.A question then,just how do the Architects work on the evolutionary demand of the multiverse?Or should I say,how do they deal with the demands of all of the collective individualized multiverses? SE1:The evolutionary demand is a function of progress and as such is also subject to individualization and collectivization.As each TES/entity progresses,its awareness of its environment and its level of understanding of that environment changes.I will continue to use the word "entity"to describe a TES (Godhead,Oversoul,or Higher Self),Aspect (Soul),or Shard(sub-Soul)as it makes the dialogue simpler. Continuing,though,this in turn changes the evolutionary capability of the environment within which the entity is working,its universe within its multiverse.And so,the result of this is that the evolutionary demand changes from one state,that which has been experienced,learned and understood to the point of mastery,to one where there is further growth,using the new level of mastery of the environment as a springboard to progress from,the evolutionary demand therefore being created as a function of progress and growth of the entity. You are about to ask a question-So how do the Architects address this increase in demand -what do they actually do? ME:You beat me to it. SE1:Of course.I just wanted to let you know that I am paying as much attention to you and your thought processes as you are to me. ME:Thank you. SE1:Well,it's not a simple answer,although I will make it as simple as possible.The first thing to do is to change your mindset from thinking in the thoughts of a single all-encompassing multiverse to one that is ultimately individualized with the ability to interlink with all of the other multiverse(s)that are attributed to all of the entities that I created.In order to do this,you need to think that you are the most important thing in the multiverse and that you are the only reason for its existence.If you try to consider the "individualized and collective states of multiverse"[The plural of multiverse is multiverse I am told;my use of multiverse(s)describes the point that one large multiverse houses a number of multiverse.Each multiverse therefore houses a number of universes,all of which are in one large multiverse.-GSN]then you will fail to appreciate its function on either the individual or the collective levels of manifestation. ME:Thank you,I now have a datum to work from. SE1:Good,that's settled then.Now,for YOU,the reader,this is also a most important consideration because when you consider the multiverse in its individualized function, the concepts become manageable,or should I say,open for consideration within the limitations of the incarnate and therefore temporary human mind. Working with this in mind then,the Architects review the basis of the environmental condition,its localization (universe)and its globalization (multiverse)and how the entity is working with it from a structural,functional,and manipulative perspective.As just stated,they then consider what I will call the level of difficulty that the current configuration of the multiverse offers to the entity and adjust its difficulty according to the entity's ability to work,evolve,and progress with the new level of difficulty. Evolutionary demand can be considered in the same way as being at school from your perspective.A teacher teaches its class to the level of which he/she is capable of teaching and when the pupil has mastered,to an acceptable level,the material being taught,a new teacher is introduced to challenge the pupil further.The new teacher's role is to elevate the pupil's knowledge further to that of the level of acceptable mastery of the new level of material being taught,and so on.From your incarnate perspective,this is the same for the use of a Guide and its Helpers.Once a Guide has elevated its ward,its Aspect,that is working within the evolutionary cycle to the level of its own competence,and this has happened to all of the Aspects created and projected by the TES,the TES migrates to the next level of its multiversal environment,and a new Guide,of a higher level of experience and evolution,takes control to assist in the eventual elevation of the TES and its Aspects to "its"level of competence,and so on,and so forth.This progression continues until the multiverse and all its potential levels,structures,states,and manipulative ability have been fully utilized. In both of these examples,and as I have recently stated,evolutionary demand,or pull, becomes apparent when the entity has mastered,to an acceptable level,the evolutionary capabilities of the environment,its structure and manipulation,that level being the choice of the entity and the decision of its Guide/s. The creation of evolutionary demand(pull),though,does not necessarily mean that the whole multiverse needs to be modified to suit the new level of difficulty or challenge attributed to the elevated progressive needs of the entity.It could simply be that a universe within the multiverse needs to be manipulated,or even,a smaller aspect of a universe within the multiverse needs to be manipulated to offer the best evolutionary progression for a particular entity. ME:So a multiverse is not specifically modified all in one go,so to speak? SE1:No,it can be modified globally (whole multiverse)or very locally (a sector within a universe within the multiverse).A sector can be as large or as small as required;there are no rules governing how big or how small the modification can or needs to be to allow the progression of the entity in the most efficient way. ME:In a nutshell then,evolutionary demand is created by an entity outgrowing the environment's ability to provide it with evolutionary progression,that it has mastered it, and that it needs a higher level of interaction with it to progress.The need to progress in an environment that provides no further progression creates the demand and the need for the Architects to change the multiverse,or an aspect of it,accordingly. SE1:Correct-good summary. Cause and Effect SE1:The Architects work on the "cause and effect"function of the multiverse,individual, and collective.Everything has a cause and effect;there is nothing that can be considered as having no cause to be or no effect on anything else. ME:Does this mean that even if the only explanation for something being in existence is "just because it is?" SE1:Correct.For example,"nothingness"has a cause,the cause being nothingness itself. When something happens-whatever it is,however insignificant it is and however small it is,it starts a chain reaction to change the status quo from void to latent intent, latent intent being in place simply because it is.If latent intent were not part of the overall beingness of nothingness,then the status quo would not change.Because though, everything has potential to be something,latent intent is a function of nothingness and as a result what can be called void or chaos is really somethingness as nothingness with the potential or latent intention to be something.That somethingness is activated from that which tips the scales and changes the status quo in the nothingness.You can call it latent intent as I have just described it but note that this latency is a function of void or chaos,for something to be able to be classified as void or chaos it must "be"something. ME:This reminds me of the discussion I had with a fellow truth seeker,Tom Campbell [see the My Big Toe books,Lightning Strike Books(9 Dec.2007)-GSN].I have not read Tom's books but a reader of mine had introduced us to understand some slight differences in nomenclature that we used to see if there was a disconnect.After a few communications, we discovered that there was no disconnect-just different views of the same picture and different descriptions for the same views of the same picture.As you can imagine,we had some complicated discussions.

SE1:The discussions were necessary for both of you;it was physical proof of the nonphysical,which is very important for you when you are immersed in the physical. And,it's also important for the readers because it gives them a datum to work with. ME:So now that we have understood that cause and effect is a function of the "environment"at any level,what exactly do the Architects do?It seems to me that it's automatic. SE1:By and large it is automatic but the Architects have the ability to amplify and de- amplify both cause and effect to ensure that the desires and expectations of the entities that create the cause obtain the correct effect.One would think this was a simple role to perform but when you look at the bigger picture of dealing with local and collective multiversal environments,and the cause and effect they have on each other,you can see how it might be a difficult role to be responsible for. Going into the work that the Architects perform a little deeper,it is important to note that they also perform a stabilizing function where the extremes of effect that result from extreme causes can create issues with those other local multiverses that are interlinked with the multiverse that is experiencing the extremes of cause and effect. ME:Why do they create a stabilizing function,I mean,what is the reason behind the need? SE1:As I have just stated,they create the stabilization between those multiverses that are interlinked and that are part of the collective multiverse.However,I can see that you want some meat on the bones,so to speak.

ME:Yes,please. SE1:OK.As you are aware,everything effects everything else,whether it is the air you move around when breathing to the water you use and change the composition of when you are washing.What was one thing is turned into something else.The effect of the expired air containing 4 percent more carbon dioxide is caused by you breathing it in and the alveoli in the lungs exchanging oxygen-enriched blood for the oxygen-depleted blood which contains additional carbon dioxide which is a waste product of the body using up oxygen to allow the correct function of muscles,organs,and other important tissues.The magnitude of the amount of carbon dioxide in the expired air is a function of the work performed by the body and the regularity of breathing to support it.Ambient air pressure and altitude also play a part.The effect of the change of the water becoming dirty and full of detergents or soaps is caused by you mixing clean water with soap to remove dirt from your skin,for example.The magnitude of change of the composition of the water plus soap/detergent and dirt is a function of how dirty you are and the amount of soap or detergent needed to remove the dirt. In the case of the changes to the local or collective multiversal environment,if the cause is significant and that significance can affect other interfacing multiverses,and/or their universal components adversely,it can create an issue with the balance of cause and effect versus the desires and intentions of the entity or entities that created the interlinked multiverse,affecting their evolutionary efficiency and direction in the process.

So in this instance,the Architects act as a filter either stopping the effect or introducing the effects of the effect in a way which can be absorbed by the affected multiverse and not create problems with their evolutionary efficiency and direction.This could be classified as a detrimental effect. On the other side of the coin,the Architects can amplify the cause if it is seen as having an advantageous effect on those multiverses that are interlinked with the multiverse that is broadcasting the effect of a cause.The Architects can also amplify the effect so that each and every interlinking multiverse experiences the effect at the most efficient level for it.Bearing in mind that we are talking about individual and local multiverses here,the most efficient effect of the original cause will be individualized to each of the interlinked multiverses.It is here where the Architects are most beneficial in their ability to change the magnitude of the functions associated with cause and effect. I know that this is very high level and not the depth that you wanted,but to go into the mechanics of how each Architect performs its function would be difficult to explain in a way that is understandable.Suffice to say,they make the changes they need to make and ensure that the effect of the causes they work with is maintained in an optimal level of evolutionary performance for every multiverse and their entities,irrespective of who or what creates it. ME:This means every individual entity's multiverse,those collectives,and the overall multiverse.

SE1:Of course.Let's talk about structure. Structure SE1:Structure is a function of what is required to be experienced to affect evolutionary progression;it is not just about the structural aspects of frequencies,subdimensions,or full dimensions. ME:Are you talking about the content within each of the universes contained within the multiverses as being the structure-or something else? SE1:The structure of the local or individualized multiverses and collective/overall multiverse,that which I initially created,are fixed to a certain point.That point being the point of commonality. Beyond the point of commonality there can be manipulation by both the individual entities and the collective.You see,there has to be a basis,a datum to start and work from. Everything else around it is subject to change,even though there is no start or finish in real terms. ME:And the Architects make the changes,making sure that the point of commonality is maintained.

SE1:Correct.The point of commonality is what allows the local and collective multiverses to be one and the same.The Architects ensure that the changes that are requested are met and the interactivity/interconnectivity of all multiversal conditions are maintained. ME:Who requests the changes to the structure? SE1:You all do.All of the entities that elect to work within the evolutionary cycle make changes to their environment to allow them to experience,learn,and evolve in their own particular way.As I have stated,the structure is not necessarily the higher-level structure of frequency,subdimension,and full dimension;it is the content,and you all change the content.Or at least you think you change the content. ME:What do you mean,we think we change the content? SE1:What you all see is the product of what you want to see around you.This is coupled together with the point of commonality to allow interconnectivity and interaction with all multiversal environments.But it's at the experiential level you wish to experience different things,and as a result,you create the environment to allow yourself to experience these things.It is your desire to experience in the way you want to experience that is recognized by the Architects,and is subsequently created for you.The lower level structure,if you want to call it that;you can also call it the operational structure and the content associated with it,being the focus of the Architects'"structural"changes. ME:The difficult bit for me to understand is that,from a human perspective,this is what we think it is.

SE1:I am not talking about what you all do on a day-to-day basis,moreover what is in place that allows you to do on a day-to-day basis what you do.This is the hidden structure, the raw material,if you like. ME:We talked about environment a lot when we talked about structure.Which comes first,environment or structure?I am getting confused. SE1:The structure creates the condition for the environment to exist.It also creates the potential for what that environment can achieve,how it can be achieved,and the laws surrounding what can be achieved by those entities that work within it and therefore manipulate it to their own requirements.Structure is,in essence,the building block/s, nanoscopic they may be,to allow creation to be manifest by those who are capable of manifesting.You desire a certain effect and the structure is used by the Architects to create that effect.Even the smallest thought about your environment is actioned by the Architects on your behalf. ME:What about when I want a certain change and it doesn't happen?Where are the Architects then? SE1:Provided your actual desire for the change is strong enough and even appropriate, they will have actioned the changes necessary to include your requirements in your local multiversal environment.However,the need to maintain the point of commonality may be such that the changes you desired may not be as effective in the overall scheme of things as you expected.And so,the change will be there but it will be diluted to the point of compliance with the point of commonality. There is also another issue that the Architects take into consideration.That is the requirements of the environment itself. Environmental Requirements ME:I thought that we create the environment and that we make the changes associated with it? SE1:You do,but the environment you create has a certain level of autonomy and as a result has its own requirements that need to be satisfied in order for it to exist in this autonomous way. ME:And what would these be? SE1:It would be best if I listed them for you.They are based upon the needs of the environment to support the individual needs of a single entity,the environment being a creation within the local/individualized multiverse assigned to that entity. Reason to be,or need-this is an immediate requirement for the environment that is created within the wider universal and ultimately multiversal environment:its reason to be being why it is in existence in the first place.The reason to be is created by the evolutionary desires of the creating entity and how they can be manifest.The environment is then modified by the Architects to support the reason to be and create a link between the dominant or original creating entity and the environment so that sympathetic changes can be actioned on an automatic basis. The ability to support individual entities'requirements is an underlying function of the reason to be.The environment will have a minimum ability requirement to allow the needs of the entity requiring its existence to support its evolutionary progression.If an environment is capable of supporting the requirements of the entity while also being capable of complying with the laws surrounding the point of commonality without major modification,then it will remain as such.If the environment will need modification later in its use,then this will be actioned by the Architects,or functions put in place for automatic modification,the maintenance entities working within the environment therefore providing the environments. Supportability is the inverse of the ability for the environment to support the requirements of those entities that are using the environment.In essence,it is the ability of the environment to be supportable.By this,I mean that it is not overtly complicated to the point of being un-maintainable by the Architects. ME:Is it possible that a universal or multiversal environment is truly unsupportable,that it is so complicated that it cannot be maintained? SE1:To date there has never been an environment that is so complicated that it cannot be supported or maintained efficiently by the Architects.This is a functional requirement for the creation of an environment.There is no point in having an environment that cannot truly support the evolutionary or other requirements of the entities that desire, elect,want,or need to use a particular environment,and so there is no point in it being unsupportable. Think of it in these terms.Currently,modern conveniences on Earth,such as automobiles,are made to such a quality that they should never need to be repaired during the designed lifetime of the vehicle;this is the same for the human vehicle. However,both automobiles and the human vehicle are designed for manufacture and ease of maintenance-ease of supportability.It is this ease of supportability that allows the Architects to work on the maintenance of the environment in the most efficient way possible. One of the ways of classifying how supportable an environment is,is by the number of Architects and other entities that are required at any one time to support the needs of the environment and the entities using it in the way they are using it.The lower the number of Architects the more supportable the environment is-as is its ease of use [see later- GSN]. You asked a question-if there is an environment that is so complicated that it cannot be supported.I will say no.However,the universal environment that incarnate mankind exists within is one of those environments that is closest to being unsupportable-but this is not as a result of complexity.The physical universe is very difficult to support simply because of the low-frequential state that it exists within,and although its level of complexity is very low as a result of its low-frequential state,maintenance entities are required to work at every level of interactivity. Sustainability can be classified as the ability of an environment to exist and support the needs of its own environmental infrastructure and the needs of the entities within it on an autonomous basis.When an environment is created or modified to support the needs of the entities using it,its ability to support itself is considered and is a fundamental requirement.The full benefit of the autonomous environment is that it doesn't need to be supported by any maintenance entities.However,this is only correct when those entities that work within the environment work in harmony with it.Any level of disharmonious interaction can affect the environmental balance and create the need for any genre of maintenance entities to intervene. Using the physical universe as an example,it is fully autonomous and self-supporting. However,there are some incarnate entities that operate in such a way that they are in almost constant states of disharmony with the environment they are within and as such,constant support is required.Incarnate mankind is one of those incarnate entities that is in constant disharmony with the autonomous functionality of the environment they exist within,hence the high number of maintenance entities that are employed and the need for this dialogue to open the eyes of your readers to the level of help required to maintain an environment.If mankind existed in a harmonious state with its environment,it would not need the level of interaction it has with the maintenance entities it currently needs.In fact,it could return to its autonomous state!

Ease of use(changeability)is a function that is part of an environment's level of natural sustainability.As those entities within,or that use,the environment evolve so the need for the environment to change itself or be changed to the new and evolving needs of those entities increases.Entities evolve or have the evolutionary needs of their environment change on either a regular or random basis,along with a local and global basis,so the environment needs to be in a position where it can support both the highly and slowly evolved entities within it at the same time.The ease of use and changeability is therefore of paramount importance to ensure that there is a seamless change experienced by the incumbent entities if they cross each other's natural location of existence. In this instance and for example,if a highly evolved entity is traveling from one location to another location within the environment,it must be able to access the functionality of the environment that is expected of its evolutionary level at all points,even when it is in an area that is normally and/or naturally supporting entities that are of a lower evolutionary level.The environment must therefore be multiversally adaptive to the demands of all entities of all evolutionary levels even if they are all existing within the same location, without any entity being able to access the level of functionality that is not consistent with their evolutionary level. Basis for existence(not the same as reason to be or need)is a function of the structural position (location)of a universe within the multiversal environment "in totality." Although the basis for the existence of the universe is not a reason or a need for its existence,the reason and need are built on to the fundamental requirement for its basis.

In simplistic terms,it is the foundation for the universe,with that foundation providing all of the raw materials and tools required to create the supportable functionality of the reason or need for a universe of a certain level and functionality to be in existence. Current diversification from the point of commonality (to support the local and collective requirements)is a metric based upon the number of Event Spaces employed to create the required individualizations of the environment versus the overall mainstream environment.In essence,a multiversal environment or a universal environment within a multiverse that is modified to suit the needs and demands of the incumbent entities has to remain linked to the point of commonality or become individualized to the point of becoming an unsustained environment.The point of commonality is by definition the framework that all variations upon the multiversal theme are based and need to be aligned to. As the fracturalization of Event Space experienced by a particular entity is based upon the number of its actualized decisions when considering the very local environment of that entity,so the number of diversifications from the mainstream environment is based upon the overall needs and demands of all the entities that use it.When a multiversal or universal environment is created,it needs to fulfill all of the requirements necessary to allow it to be of evolutionary benefit.As the demands of the incumbent entities change the "harmony of fit"between the initial and generalized environment and the demands of the entities working within it change,the evolutionary benefit reduces accordingly. In order to recreate the harmony of fit,the environment is allowed to diversify from its original structure and functionality to one where it "fits"and returns to being of evolutionary benefit and experience with an increase in evolutionary efficiency as a result. Although it can be seen that a multiversal or universal environment has to be generalized, the incumbent entities also create versions or diversifications from the original structure and function that is relevant to themselves and,of course,those entities that they interact with.Event Space therefore has three functions here: 1.to create the overall diversification from the point of original creation; 2.to create the connectivity to the overall diversification from the point of commonality required to ensure that all diversified environments remain connected to the common theme; 3.that the smaller localized environments are connected to the point of commonality of the overall diversified environment that they are locally diversified from,and that that diversification is connected to the point of commonality within the original creation. Maximum available diversification from the point of commonality can be expressed in terms of the number of Event Spaces available for the creation of a diversified environment at the levels of both overall diversification and local diversification. ME:For some reason I feel that this is a function of the structure of The Origin and that this function is based upon the number twelve and its squares [multiples of the same value -i.e.,12 x 12 144-GSN].Is this correct? SE1:Not in the way that you are expressing it,for the maximum number of diversifications is dependent upon the initial level of difficulty,so to speak,of the originating multiversal or universal environment. The maximum number of diversifications from the point of commonality is that number of environments(Event Spaces),overall or localized,from an already diversified environment,that can be created before that environment no longer has any level of commonality-no matter how small-to the originating creation.Don't forget that Event Space is just the holding/creating space for a particular environmental version and not the environment itself.As discussed in previous dialogues with you [with other Source Entities and The Origin,etc.-GSN]when Event Spaces have reached their evolutionary dead end,they converge back to the mainstream Event Space.This is the same for a diversified multiverse or universe because once the diversification has played its role in the evolutionary progression of the entity or entities that are within it,or that have created the diversification,that version is removed from existence allowing the entity or entities to move back in to the next closest environment aligned to them and to the point of commonality. Number of maintenance entities required is a function of its autonomy and complexity -that being,the more autonomous or simple a multiversal or universal environment is,the smaller the number of entities are required to maintain it.One factor in understanding the number of maintenance entities required is the number of entities that have elected to use that environment as an evolutionary medium and how much diversification they create.Although it is usual for a multiversal environment to have a known number of maintenance entities aligned with it,and that they also maintain the diversifications,it is common for these diversifications to need additional maintenance entities to support those areas of diffuse diversification that are so far away from the point of commonality that they are close to having no commonality at all,while still having enough structure to keep it within the need to be maintained. The specialization of maintenance entities required is the result of the number of core variants of diversification that are created/have been created.In essence,these are the maintenance entities that deal with the smaller and more obscure differences between a multiversal/universal environment and its commonality with the environment that was originally created.Clearly,there are maintenance entities that have specialist roles to play within the original creation,but this does not include those entities that are "one-offs,"so to speak. Just for interest,the universe that provides an environment for the Earth has a high number of specialist maintenance entities and the highest number of "one-off" specialists.I state a difference between specialist entities and "one-off"specialist entities here because it is possible for entities to specialize in general maintenance-of which there are countless numbers,common specialists,of which there are fewer numbers,but are nevertheless not able to perform general functions even though their specialism may span a number of environments,and true specialists for the maintenance of multiversal/ universal functions that are seen in one variant of environmental diversification only. Spatial requirements is allotment of the aspects of structure that gives an environment the appearance of having space or volume.Spatial requirements are therefore the identification of which frequencies,subdimensional components,full dimensions,and zones are to be used for the creation of the environment and the space or volume that it creates.When a multiversal environment is created,the total number of ways that it can be used by the number of entities that will be using it are calculated and the spatial requirements of each entity throughout its evolutionary cycle is taken into consideration. Also taken into consideration is the function of Event Space and how that will augment the spatial requirements.As Event Space cannot be actively allotted to an environment because it is an integrated and autonomous function of the structure of The Origin,the potential variables of Event Space that can be created within the aspects of structure identified can only be understood by adding and subtracting structural components that are known by the Architects to be malleable or adjustable by them.You will notice that "zones"were mentioned a moment ago,and you may even remember that zones are not part of the current multiversal environment that I created. ME:Yes,I did wonder.I did see an image in my mind's eye,though,that showed me that the multiverse is constructed within one of the zones allotted as the energetic structure used by the sentience that is you,Source Entity One.I then thought that how could this work because in one of the first dialogues with you,you stated that you split yourself into two-one half being you and the other half being an environmental structure for evolutionary experience,this structure then being populated by all of the smaller individualized versions of you,our True Energetic Selves(TES)that were created to experience the minute detail of that environment.Within this now rather old dialogue, I thought that this would include a full "half"of your structure,not what I would guess is one twelfth of your structure-a zone! SE1:It was a reasonable but incorrect assumption,one that was not in the right time to correct,for you would not have understood it then.Suffice to say,I will correct it now. Although I have allotted a full half of my sentient energy and structure to my multiverse and its inhabitants,this full half is contained within one zone. ME:How does that work,I mean,how can you have one half of you residing within one twelfth of you? SE1:This is purely a function of the spatial mechanics of each level of structure. Everything from every component from one "proper"level can be housed in one component of the structure above it,and so one half of the volume of my structure at the full dimension,subdimensional component,and frequential levels are located within one of my zones,the zones being a level of my structure that are not part of the multiverse you exist within are in fact individually large enough to house all of the structure of the multiverse,so why use six zones when I can use one to do the same thing?This was a calculation I made when creating the multiverse and although from the point of view of full dimensions,the multiverse and all of you is half of me,from the perspective of zones,it is one twelfth.Think of it as being space within space occupying the same space concurrently. ME:And the need for volume is for what? SE1:Giving you the space to create,exist,and evolve both individually and collectively without interfering with each other's "space,"so to speak. Frequential requirements is the finitude required to allow the creation of basic structure. Simply put,the higher the frequency,the more basic structural content that frequency can hold.The lower the frequency,the less basic structural content it can hold.Within the structure of an environment-from the perspective of this multiversal environment, that is-it is the state of the frequencies that allows the basic building blocks of an environment to be established.So far,I have only talked about frequencies in the "general sense,"but when I talk about the frequential requirements in terms of the construction of a multiversal and universal(within the multiverse)environment,I want you to consider the following:·how many frequencies what types of frequency what energies the frequencies are aligned to what structural level do these frequencies exist on/within

what are the functions of the frequencies identified what substructure can they create what building blocks can they create and at what structural level they are manifest what depth of structure can they create and at what level this depth is manifest what frequencies can be linked together to create a bigger frequential condition-the creation of bandwidth how the creation of bandwidth can be used to link environments together what each frequency can create in totality the efficiency of creativity experienced by each frequency which frequencies can exist within each other which frequencies interfere with each other which frequencies are universally acceptable-so-called golden frequencies

ME:There is a lot to think about here.I expect that the list above is not exhaustive? SE1:No,there is of course much more to understanding the frequential requirements of a multiversal environment,including how they can be used to support the connectivity of the higher levels of structure as well.Frequencies can create doorways into and out of the overall structure and can also create the shortcuts so to speak between the structural levels,specifically when considering those frequencies that can exist within each other and/or are universally acceptable to each other. In summary,though,the basic requirement is captured in the following thought process when creating a multiversal and/or universal environment-what frequencies do I need and how many of them do I require to enable an evolutionary efficient environment to be created?

## The Illustrators 

Having finished with the Architects and spending some time to reflect on what they are and what they are responsible for,I am very aware that I was given the smallest of overviews by The Source.I was also becoming aware that most if not all of the roles and responsibilities of the entities I am about to enter into dialogue about,effectively work for the Architects.You will also see that they work for each other and work based upon the work of others.So,we appear to actually have a hierarchical structure(rather than a man-made suggestion of one)of entities who work collectively and individually for the evolutionary efficiency of the multiversal/ universal environment/s (mainstream and localized)used by those entities that have elected to be in the evolutionary cycle.In my mind,therefore,the work of the Illustrators starts this hierarchy of interactive responsibility.What I was not expecting,though,was the use of The Source's energetic memory as a tool for maintaining the multiverse. As with all of The Source's (God's)helpers,I decided to introduce the basis of the roles and responsibilities of the Illustrators by using some of the executive summary used at the start of the book as a lead-in to the deeper knowledge about them. ME:The Illustrators are those entities that work with The Source's overall energetic memory.Although this was referred to as the Akashic records in the summary at the start of this dialogue,the Akashic is only one small part of this energetic memory and is only relative to recording the work of those entities recognized as energetic mankind. The overall energetic memory encompasses all that our Source Entity has experienced through its own work and work with other Source Entities.The Illustrators use the ability to interact with The Source's energetic memory to describe (illustrate)the different possibility scenarios that may be created by making changes to the structure of the multiverse or its local areas,whether new or modified. SE1:That's a reasonable summary and one that is almost identical to mine at the start of this dialogue. ME:It was supposed be.I very much feel that these dialogues are different from my previous dialogues and so it will be good practice to remind the readers about the general subject matter before we get into the depth. SE1:You are starting to get good at this-just watch your ego when I praise you. ME:I will,thank you. SE1:Good,I will continue. The Illustrators have responsibility for one of the more important functions in the creation of an environment.They have the ability to "fine-tune"the evolutionary efficiency of every aspect of a multiversal structure.In order to achieve this,they need to be able to see all of the possibilities associated with a particular multiversal or universal construct and how the incumbent entities affect it,ensuring that the environment is robust and responsive in all possibilities and eventualities.

ME:This very much looks like the Illustrators are working at the level of the individual entity to achieve their work. SE1:Not just the entity level,the entity,collective entity,environmental,environmental and entity and collective entity levels. ME:I guess that includes the collective entity levels at all of the locations that entities coalesce in as well,so that would be collectives of collectives as well. SE1:Yes,and the multiples and permutations of those multiples of collectives and entities and environments.I am looking at you thinking ME:What am I thinking about? SE1:That this is just a high-level understanding,one that sees the multiverse as the environmental condition being discussed and not the environments within the environments as well as the environments created by individual entities as variations from the standard environment. ME:That's right.I would like to go into more detail later but right now I want to ask you about your use of two words.You said that the Illustrators look at the robustness and responsivity of an environment in terms of its possibilities and eventualities.I feel that the reader knows the dictionary description of these two words,as do I,but I feel that they have a deeper meaning.

Possibilities,Probabilities,Eventualities,and Inevitabilities! SE1:You are correct.You see,the work of the Illustrators,as already stated,work with the ability of my energetic memory.My energetic memory is really my sentience occupying a certain type of energy that is particularly good at containing (recording)all that my creations and I have experienced and created.They use this energy to work with all that has been in existence,is in existence,and could be in existence in relation to the internal (entity-based-individual and collective)and external (Architect preference)based influences on a particular environment.By using this energy,they can create models of possible environmental conditions by changing the mix of internal and external influence while identifying what mix of influences created the strongest and weakest possibilities. One thing I will advise you on and that is that possibilities are not parallel conditions. Although they are completely separate from each other,they are interdependent. ME:What do you mean,they are separate but interdependent? SE1:Possibilities areacondition of fracturalized choice.Fracturalized choice is a function of upstream and downstream influences and the changes created as a subsequence of those changes being adopted by the incumbent entities of the environment.So,it is the possibilities,created by fracturalized choice that create alternative conditions-parallel environments.Parallel environments,however,are manifest(brought into reality)by a function of a semi-sentient energy called Event Space which pervades all that is-The Origin,and therefore pervades all of me,all of my environment and all of my creations.[See The Origin Speaks.-GSN]

SE1:Eventualities are conditions that are created by a series of interactive possibilities that create a strong enough event line to pull all other possibilities into a single event-an eventuality. ME:Isn't this a normal function of Event Space? SE1:This is not the same as Event Spaces reconverging back into a mainstream Event Space because a mainstream Event Space is a condition that remains as a result of evolutionary dead ends terminating the possibility fractals,whereas an eventuality is a condition where a series of interactive possibilities are strong enough to override the mainstream Event Space creating an eventuality. ME:So a mainstream Event Space is not a robust singular Event Space that every possibility stems from then.It is simply a stronger possibility than the fracturalized possibilities? SE1:That's correct.Every event is a possibility,it's just that some are more possible than others and a mainstream Event Space is the most possible outcome-it's not the eventual outcome-it's the most probable one based upon the normalized distribution of fractal possibilities that are created by the incumbent entities of a particular environment. Eventualities are created by,for want of a better word,the skewed distribution of fractal possibilities that are skewed to the point of dominance rather than consequence.Once in the point of dominance,a new mainstream Event Space emerges,and all other Event Spaces eventually converge into that one.

ME:Is it possible then to have a series of possible mainstream Event Spaces? SE1:It is more likely to be a parallel of mainstream Event Spaces.[chuckle] ME:I get the joke-thanks.So it is possible to have "a number of"mainstream Event Spaces? SE1:In the event...[chuckle again] ME:You really are enjoying this,aren't you! SE1:Yes,I like the play on words.Continuing on then.In the event that the skewed distribution of fractal possibilities is in itself created by skewed distributions of fractal possibilities,we have the possibility of a number of possible mainstream Event Spaces that have the same potential to become the mainstream Event Space.In this instance, none of them is classified as an eventuality because they are all mainstream. However,in the "further"event that there is a series of interactive possibilities that are strong enough to override the skewed distribution of skewed mainstream Event Spaces, they will create an eventuality that will succeed in being the mainstream Event Space above and beyond those other mainstream Event Spaces. ME:So what are eventualities then?I see them as being something that is inevitable in that case! SE1:No.Inevitability is something different altogether.

ME:What?Are you telling me that there are such things as inevitabilities in Event Space? SE1:Of course there are-why are you so surprised? ME:One would think that by now I should not be surprised by anything I channel. SE1:That you will continue to be surprised is an inevitability.You don't need to write "chuckle"in parenthesis,the readers will have understood the joke easily. ME:Thank you for your confidence.Tell me what an inevitability is in terms of Event Space. SE1:An inevitability is the result of a number of skewed distributions of skewed mainstream Event Spaces that end up reinforcing the original mainstream Event Space. An inevitable Event Space is therefore one that can never be superseded,modified, changed,or deleted as a result of any external or internal influence by entity, environment,or space. ME:Maybe you should have stated that this is what a mainstream Event Space is in reality. SE1:A mainstream Event Space is not an inevitability though.It can only be called as such when nothing can affect the outcome of that Event Space being the remaining Event Space in a specific evolutionary cycle.This means that the Event Space is robust enough to survive-intact through every eventuality and the probabilities associated with it that may manifest as a result of the interaction of the incumbent entities and/or their various levels of environment-local,global,galactic,universal,or multiversal.

ME:Probabilities,we have forgotten about probabilities! SE1:No,we haven't. ME:But I thought that probabilities would be discussed after possibilities. SE1:No need to. ME:Why not? SE1:Because they are not part of the procession associated with possibility-eventuality- inevitability. ME:I still don't get it. SE1:That's because in terms of the creation of Event Space a probability is applicable to all three conditions.There can be probable possibilities,probable eventualities,and probable inevitabilities. ME:I can see that the "probability"aspect of Event Space could be a sort of "wild card."I can even see it as a more affirmative condition of possibility and eventuality. What I can't see is how an inevitability can be probable.I mean,an inevitability is inevitable. SE1:Not true.You see,when the Illustrators are using my energetic memory,they are looking at everything from a very high advantage point.They are "illustrating"what the outcomes are of certain internal and external interactions-including what they,as a function of the Curators,can,should,might,or will do to the environment they are working with.Based upon this,and from their high advantage point,they can see that certain inevitabilities are probable-are probabilities-if they allow them to be as such. ME:What you are saying then is that,in my interpretation,an inevitability is something that is a naturally occurring condition that an Event Space can achieve.A probable inevitable Event Space is a condition that is so far upstream in the scheme of things that it is only probable that a certain Event Space will become inevitable,and that it will be able to withstand every eventuality and the probabilities associated with it.It is not by definition an inevitable conclusion-yet. SE1:That's it.You have it now.You see this is where the Illustrators come into their own. They can see all of this and manipulate the internal and external conditions accordingly to observe all,and I mean all,of the outcomes that can be created-in any and every eventuality. ME:What is the reason for all this then?I mean,if we have free will to be able to work with the environment that is in the evolutionary cycle,there must be billions of different scenarios that the Illustrators look at.What is the point? SE1:The whole point is to create an efficient environment for evolutionary progression and that that environment is robust and resilient to all forces.There is no point to building a house on shifting sand;it will collapse-so why build it!If you must build a house,you must create a solid foundation on solid rock.Then and only then will it stand the test of the variability of an infinitely variable environment. This was a train of thought that I didn't expect,even though I should have.The possibility of so many variables was difficult to comprehend,even though I have spent a lot of the last fifteen years being exposed to such concepts.The most difficult thing for the reader to comprehend, though,would be the sheer variation on the multiversal theme that could be experienced by each and every one of us individually and/or collectively.Additionally,that all of this variability was not only being monitored by a group of dedicated entities,but was understood, managed,and manipulated by them before they were presumably allowed to be accessed by any or all of us was amazing to say the least.The more we discover about our environment I thought,the more we find out that it is controlled by a higher power,one that was also created, and that this environment is convoluted-beyond belief and comprehension. I know very well that I sound as if I have only just begun to understand what the Greater Reality is,and that this is a dichotomy when one considers that this is my seventh book on the subject.Or,that the level of my unwavering acceptance of the detail that was broadcast by my writing style and thoughts in the six books prior to this one suggested prior knowledge or a deep level of understanding is being dissolved,suggests invention on my part.Well,my answer to these thoughts is simply this.Everything I have received to date is real,it is true,and it is not invented.I have done enough soul searching,checking,calibrating,and double searching, checking and calibrating to ensure this.This is the way of the engineer in me.Test,test again, and test again for a third time before releasing.

I sat back in my chair,my "deck chair!"I was sitting in the back garden of my UK home.I like working outside when I can;it clears the mind.I was wondering why I had typed these words of idle discussion when I was told why.The Source decided to intervene! SE1:You are always checking to see if you are going mad or that you are being delusional, aren't you? ME:Yes.For some reason I think I am going backward.I found it easy to communicate with you and The Origin originally.It even became easier when I communicated with the other Source Entities,SE's 2 through 12.But I seem to be struggling with this book.It feels like it's the same stuff,so to speak,but it's harder to get my head around it. SE1:Everything to date has been given to you at a level and rate of flow that you could cope with.When you first communicated with my peers,the other Source Entities,you felt the difference and had to concentrate-hard.Since then you have grown to be able to assimilate a level of understanding and broadcast it in a way that could be understood by those truth seekers who were ready.Even though it appeared "deep,"it was really surface-level information.Incarnate mankind is not even in the kindergarten stage of connectivity with itself,environment,or thinking capacity to be able to take much deeper information,and you are no different,especially in your current vessel.Constant exposure to such material can create two main thought conditions.One,it can create an ego and subsequent loss of perspective and need to validate that which one receives- especially when one's readers put you on a pedestal.Two,it can create self-doubt as one receives deeper and deeper levels of information which in turn requires a deeper level of understanding,which is not always forthcoming.It is due to being overloaded with the plethora of potential thoughts,directions,and subsequent questions to ask. If you are not questioning yourself,your environment,that which you are exposed to as higher aspects of that environment and the entities or beings within it that come with such exposure,then one is not capable of working with such depth in a balanced and robust way. There is a fine line between blind acceptance,understanding,and questioning prior to acceptance.Blind acceptance can be coercive in terms of lack of understanding deemed as understanding that leads to delusion.True understanding is recognized by the individual as levels of understanding and levels of none or poor understanding,which is only achieved through observing oneself from a distance-by questioning the self-being honest to one's self.That you,after so much exposure to Me,my peers,and The Origin can question yourself,your knowledge,your understanding of that knowledge,means that you are maintaining your integrity. ME:It looks like these thoughts were my..."greater"reality check!!! SE1:They are.They are important for you to express,and for your readers to experience you expressing them.It validates who and what you are and what you are doing.You will be in this particular "boat"for the rest of your/this incarnate existence,and,yes,do use it as your "greater"reality check.And don't worry about the feelings of doubt about your ability to understand levels of knowledge that you thought you understood before.The detail may not appear to be much deeper than that which you have broadcast in previous books,and this may be how the readers perceive it,but the energies associated with the detail are different.You are experiencing a more accurate feeling of the level of energy associated with certain knowledge than before,even with that of The Origin and the other Source Entities,because you are not being shielded so much.I know that you thought that, and were told that,the shielding was removed some time ago,but that was to give you confidence to go on.You are now getting to the point where you can stand up for yourself, so to speak.Move on to the next subject now and be confident again-quietly confident, that is!

## The Planners 

I was still reeling a bit;I was still a bit shaky about appearing to go backward in my ability to understand,especially in the minds of my readers.I knew that this was just the ego,my ego,doing its best to take advantage of my confidence in spiritual/metaphysical matters to bring me down the frequencies and perpetuate its own existence.It was doing this by creating overconfidence and then self-doubt.[See article on the ego in the appendix of The Anne Dialogues.-GSN]I shuddered.I must be more careful,I thought.No one is safe from their ego -no one. I tuned back into a dialogue with The Source to see what role the Planners had in maintaining/ controlling the multiverse and all its variants. SE1:The Planners work to effect a timely introduction of the decisions made as a result of the work of the Illustrators.They achieve this by ensuring that the chosen scenario is actioned in the "reality"chosen for it to exist within.They ensure that the changes are introduced in a seamless way. ME:I reckon that about sums it up.No need to elaborate any further.I mean,my readers will understand that paragraph in one go. SE1:They will,but as with all executive summaries,it is designed to give an overview of the subject matter,one that entices the reader to want to know the depth and detail behind the words of the summary.

ME:You are about to tell me that this is another convoluted subject that just appears to be easy,aren't you? SE1:I could be.Nothing is as simple as it seems. ME:Yes,I do know that.OK,what's the deal with the Planners? SE1:The Planners work with the Illustrators but at a different level of interactive structure than the Illustrators themselves. When the Illustrators work with the multiversal environments and their variants due to probability,possibility,eventuality,and inevitability,they look at the function of the environment from the perspective of the full evolutionary cycle.Even though they use my energetic memory to work with the different variations of static,fractal,and parallel environmental direction,it is a very high-level view. ME:I am seeing what they see.The Planners are showing me what the Illustrators see. It's obviously a humanized version,but is very interesting.I am told this is just one way in which they see the fractalization of the multiversal environment that they use.I see a simple line,the mainstream Event Space.This line stretches ahead in front of me;I follow it.As I follow it,I see it fractalizing and duplicating/triplicating/quadruplicating, etc.,etc.I don't see a multiverse,I just see a representation of a stream of events in all of the locations and frequential states and other structural components associated with the multiversal environment.

This is difficult,I thought.I am expecting to see a multiverse and the division or parallelization of other multiversal environments from the mainstream multiverse in my mind's eye.I have to keep the thought process in my head that I am not seeing a multiverse.I am seeing a representation of a stream of events,the events created by the entities/beings that will be using this particular multiversal environment."The stream of events;this is the stream of events,"I thought again! As I followed on,I noticed that I could rise above the stream,and move in and out of it as it carried on in its forward motion and fractalized.Then,all of a sudden,everything became blurred,everything appeared to be duplicated,no,triplicated. Every stream of events,every Event Space appeared to have been duplicated.As I refocused my eyes I see that,from the point of separation from the mainstream series of events,every Event Stream appeared to be exactly the same,but only up to a certain level.After that level,the changes to the Event Stream changed according to the potential for change.From this perspective,the changes looked nonexistent when comparing one Event Stream to another but as I looked closer I noticed that what I can only describe as "the color of frequency"changed.There were the obvious fractals that were created as a result of changes that were in turn created as a result of what I am now being told is attributed to the functions of collective choices.These choices were where whole groups of entities chose a change or alternative direction or a different way to experience the environment that they were in but that which resulted in a dichotomy,trichotomy, or quadrochotomy,etc.,etc.,where a choice was made after exposure to a number of possibilities or probabilities.However,the changes that were represented by the colors of the frequency were describing the localized changes to the Event Stream that was affecting entities or beings on the individual or small group level.The colors I am being told are what can be called interference to the main and fractal streams of events that were experienced by the individual or small groups of entities/beings but were not significant enough to affect the overall Event Stream,main,static,parallel,or fractalized. The Planners tell me that the Illustrators work on these overall Event Streams.Changing them as required at both the fractal and parallel level to maintain a level of stability required to allow the local Event Stream levels to function in both an interactive and isolated way to these large Event Streams.They can see the whole evolutionary cycle from this position and can make the changes necessary without being deeply involved in the detail of the individual interactions of entities,beings,or the environment itself if it only affects the environment and is not significant enough to make a parallel or fractal Event Stream. Seeing the bigger picture and all of its probabilities,potentials,eventualities,or inevitabilities,the Illustrators work on the changes necessary to affect a desired experiential and therefore evolutionary outcome.The Illustrators show (illustrate)the overall outcomes and routes to those outcomes based upon changes to the Event Streams, or not,as the case may be. Apparently-they are telling me-this is the only method through which I(and incarnate humankind)would be able to digest or understand this information.

SE1:That's right.You will need to wait a moment to see how the Event Stream works with the parallelization and fractalization of the multiversal environments themselves. To help continue the flow of the description you started,and did so very well,I will carry on to say again that the Planners work within the individual,and small group detail of the Event Streams,those that don't make the Event Streams fractalize or parallelize.Working within the so-called resistance,they see how best to place the result of entities/beings interacting with their environment and those other entities/beings by ensuring that the chosen scenarios are actioned in the "reality"chosen for it to exist within.This means that they weave a series of tentative and stable lines of environment and Event Streams together to create what you may call a reality.The functions of individual,local,and large entity/environmental interaction are classified as "scenario."A reality therefore can be defined as the melding together of environment and Event Stream. ME:All of the time I see this information,it is represented in a linear way.I know so very well that this is not linear in the Greater Reality and that it is concurrent-that being, everything happens at the same overall event,the same space,the same Event Space. SE1:Correct. ME:So why do I see everything in a linear fashion? SE1:Because,as you state yourself so many times,this is the only way in which you can understand it and observe the functions of what is being presented to you.More importantly,this is the only way in which incarnate mankind can understand it as well.

It is more important for you to understand the concept rather than the mechanics behind the concept.Understanding the mechanics requires higher frequency interconnectivity with your TES,which in the low-frequency position you are in is close on impossible to connect with at a high enough level to allow correct understanding at the experiential level. ME:Should I continue to explain what I see then?Would it be beneficial to incarnate mankind to relay the information in the way that is,quite frankly,limited to our incarnate condition? SE1:Yes,of course.You have to start somewhere.And so does incarnate mankind,no matter how educated or knowledgeable they feel they are. ME:OK.I think you are entertaining me a little because I am seeing another representation of the Event Stream,one where each event is a bubble of interaction between entity/being and the environment it is working within. SE1:I am offering you an alternative visualization,one that although less linear in its representation,is nevertheless understandable to you and incarnate mankind. ME:Thank you,I will continue.The bubbles (events)grow and explode into another bubble or shrink and implode into nothingness.Those bubbles that are growing sometimes explode into another bubble that is nearby creating a new but combined bubble.At other times they explode into a new bigger bubble allowing them to cope with an expansion of event fractals that are still combined together in the space,the Event Space,which was created for the original and static Event Stream. Those bubbles of events that shrink and implode either disappear totally,thus representing an end of that particular Event Stream,or they implode and reappear within another event.I am just being told that when this happens,it is because the originating Event Stream bubble fractalized to create a new event bubble and when that bubble has naturally ended its usefulness,it implodes back into its originating Event Stream bubble. SE1:Good,now carry on with what you can see. ME:I feel compelled to describe,in a limited way,the function of the bubble.The bubble captures all of the events,the stream of events,and localized interference.The changes that were represented by the colors of the frequency were describing the localized changes to the Event Stream.These changes were affecting entities or beings on the individual or small group level in the more linear description of Event Stream previously described. The localized interference is represented in this instance by the creation of local minute bubbles that appeared to be like froth that ebbed and flowed within the bubble.Again,this is the interference to the main and fractal streams of events that were experienced by the individual or small groups of entities/beings but were not significant enough to affect the overall Event Stream,main,static,parallel,or fractalized within that bubble.All this being said,everything happens in a concurrent way,an instantaneous way,and that includes the creation and destruction of fractalized Event Streams and their spaces within and without their originating Event Stream bubbles.

SE1:Very good.The Planners use a version of the-er-this,real Event Stream [real time in our language-GSN]observation to work on how they may make changes to the Event Streams and their environments to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication of the events they are witnessing.As stated before,they use the energies associated with my so-called memory function to isolate all of these Event Streams in one temporary, but nevertheless fully functional,Event Space and establish the criteria that creates duplication and therefore inefficient entity/being interaction.Once this is understood, the Planners position alternative Event Streams in place that cancel out the possibilities, and of course,all variations of probability,eventuality,and inevitability to ensure that the events and their streams are optimized. In terms of your personal observations,I will describe this in two ways.In the linear version of your description,you used lines to represent the Event Streams that divided in a fractal way.This would be like an Event Stream that appeared to come in the reverse direction of the inefficient Event Stream and cancel it out at the point of fractalization,in effect making it appear that it did not exist in the first place.In the bubble version,the bubble of events appears to expand and contract,the expansion stopping at the point of inefficiency and contracting back to the point of efficiency.In the case of the Event Stream bubbles that implode,there is no change. ME:Why is there no change?

SE1:Simply because there is a natural demise of the inefficient Event Stream bubble and therefore the Planners don't need to work with it.That is,if that Event Stream bubble is considered not to be necessary. ME:Hold on.Are you about to say that an Event Stream bubble or indeed its linear version that is inefficient may still be used by the Planners in some way? SE1:You've got it.There are times when an Event Stream bubble or a linear representation of an event in an isolated way are useful. ME:Why isolated?I would have thought that if the Event Stream bubble that would have imploded was considered useful enough to allow its natural demise to be put in stasis, that it should be allowed to interact with the other Event Stream bubbles in and around it? SE1:No.This is the beauty of the role of the Planners,for they can do just as you say or isolate the Event Stream or let it demise in its natural way.In general,though,they prefer to maintain those Event Stream bubbles that naturally demise but are considered to be useful in isolation as individual cases and upon their own merit. Know this.Event Streams are an experiential condition that are a necessary function of the need-that is,my need and the need of all my creations to evolve and ultimately progress.If those that are in demise are seen as an opportunity for augmenting our/my evolution and progression,then the Planners maintain their existence as an Event Stream that will be used by both the Planners in the creation of the reality to be expressed by their work and the entities that exist and work within that reality.

ME:Ah!You talked momentarily about what a reality is,that it is the melding together of environment and Event Stream.How do the Planners work with the multiversal environment?Surely the observation of the Event Stream,linear-or bubble-based from my understanding,also includes the observation of the multiversal,universal,or local environment associated with the Event Stream.I say this because they cannot be mutually exclusive when in observation. SE1:From your position,I would agree that this would be a reasonable thought process. Also,from the perspective of linear thought processes you have on Earth,this would make perfect sense.However,the Planners in conjunction with the Illustrators have the ability to observe event,Event Stream,Event Space,and environment collectively and in isolation so they are able to affect changes to any manifestation of these observations, make individualized changes,and see the effect on any aspect of the reality collectively created by them. The multiversal environment/s provide the basis for the events and Event Streams to exist,primarily because they are the foundation for the creation of event/s.Even if there is no basis for an environment that can be classified as a universe or as a universe existing as part of a multiversal condition,so long as a "space"is either capable of supporting the existence of entities or beings,or is actually allowing the existence of entities within it, then it can be classified as an environment,and an Event Stream is invoked automatically. The Event Space,of course,having already been invoked to demarcate the difference between the potential to be an Event Stream and an active Event Stream itself.

ME:Which comes first then,the Event Stream or the environment,universal or multiversal?Recognizing that before all of them is Event Space,which is always in existence? SE1:The space,if you want to call it that,needs to be populated in some way first before it can be called or classified as an environment.Once it is classified as an environment, it then needs to be classified as either a monoversal (local environment),universal (more than one locality that can be classified as monoversal,but within the space that is universal),or multiversal(more than one universal environment). ME:Do you mean populated with entities or beings(of any sort)-energetic or incarnate? SE1:Not necessarily.It can be populated with anything that can create an event,a series of events (Event Stream),or the potential or possibility of the creation of an event or series of events.It doesn't need to have sentient energies involved either,just evolution or progression of any sort. ME:So an environment,of any demarcation,is a"space"for any type of change,the change being the event? SE1:Simplistically,that's correct. ME:And I take it that this is an automatic function? SE1:Yes and no.It depends upon whether an environment is the subject of natural progressive evolution-what you might call Darwinian evolution,or it is the subject of intervention-based evolution.Intervention-based evolution is a function of deliberate planning on behalf of the Curators by the Planners. When considering the multiversal environments,the Planners can work at any point in the detail from the minutest area of an environment to the largest or total environmental area. ME:Would you like to elaborate a little on that because I have just seen an image that suggests that they can and do work on a multi-multiversal environment.Is that not an omniverse? SE1:No,an omniversal environment is a descriptor for the function of the structure of The Origin.A multi-multiversal environment is a structural function,created or not,that exists within a Source Entity.Having said that,Event Space will create the appearance of an omniversal condition simply due to the multiple but parallel environments created by the choice of the entities within that multiversal environment,as you are aware. What you are seeing is the ability of the Planners to effectively move a part of or indeed a whole universe from one multiverse to another.This is an important function,especially if one or a number of the reality/ies created in one multiverse are not totally harmonious with the overall theme of the multiversal environment that it was originally part of. ME:Are you suggesting that the Planners can mix and match the universes within a specific multiverse to those of another multiverse?

SE1:Yes,of course.When they take everything into consideration,it may well be that the environment and Event Stream associated with one universe,or part of a universe,is best placed in another environmental location,one that it is in overall harmony with the series of events that create the overall Event Stream. ME:How does that work,I mean,I would have expected that the Planners work on one particular multiverse and that they work on maintaining the integrity of that multiverse, not take parts of one multiverse or universe and place them in another. SE1:Remember that the multiverse that you exist and evolve within is that part of me which is reserved for smaller parts of my sentience to discover,work with,and manipulate the fine detail of what I am.This creates multiversal environments that are specific to the actions,thoughts,and behaviors of an individual or a group of individual entities.It is at these levels where the Planners see where one aspect of a multiversal/ universal environment is best suited to another.What's more,they do this before the environment itself is allowed to become active-so to speak. Just what is a reality? ME:Just a moment ago,you talked about the components that make up a reality,those being the environment and the Event Stream that creates the reality.I really want you to elaborate on this a little because,as I am sure you can sense,both myself and my readers would love to understand a bit more about what a reality is and how we affect it.

SE1:I will try to describe this in a simple overview and then we can delve a little deeper into each one. In essence,there are a number of types of reality that exist as a function of environment and Event Stream.I will just use the word Event Stream now and not use the bubble-or line-based imagery as a descriptor.They are: The Overall Reality (what you call the Greater Reality) The Multiversal Reality The Universal Reality·The Global Reality·The Local Reality The Locally Individualized Reality The Individualized Reality The Overall Reality is the experiential condition that is created by the existence of the sentience that is The Origin.It contains all of its personal experiences,growth, realizations,creations,and explorations of self.It is the only reality that can be considered static in function and observation,with of course the possible variations due to The Origin's own evolutionary and progressive growth that creates greater knowledge of self and ability.The overall reality encompasses everything that is,was,and will be,taking into account that everything exists NOW!Please note that The Origin is the only sentience that has the capability to operate beyond the function of Event Space and so variation upon The Origin's reality is not a function of the creation of Event Spaces due to its own opportunities or possibilities,etc.,for choice.That is,if it decides to operate above it. The Multiversal Reality is the experiential condition that is created by the governing entities responsible for a specific multiversal environment within a specific Source Entity. Bearing in mind that we are only discussing the multiverse that I created,it represents the final configuration of the environment in all its detail and scenario of events-the Event Stream-chosen by the Curators as being the optimal environment for evolutionary progression at this particular juncture in my existence.It is a generalized function of reality and is subject to change both by the Planners,other Curator functions,and the interactions of the incumbent entities/beings that are working within that environment. The Universal Reality is a smaller representation of the multiversal reality insomuch as it starts out to be that when a multiverse and its universal components are first introduced as a medium for evolutionary progression.Universal environments are where the complexities of reality start to emerge as the result of the interaction of entities with entities and their environment.From this point onward reality becomes,for want of a better word,a convoluted interaction of hierarchical conditions that are variations of the original theme,but that have the potential to become in total variance to it while being within an overall theme of reality.The universal reality can only be changed as a result of all entities within that environment choosing to change the reality as a total collective. The Global Reality is a further dissection of the overall theme of reality.However,in this instance,it is relative to an area within a universal reality that affects a large but not significant number of entities within the universal environment.The global reality can therefore be described in universal terms as being akin to an area the size of a galaxy [a useful descriptor when considering the physical universe-our universe-GSN]and the entities that work within the location of that galaxy.A group of entities within the universal environment can change the universal reality within their galactic environment if they work collectively together and choose to work in variance with the governing universal reality that it is within.At this point,we now start to see actively chosen realities within a reality. The Local Reality is the official start of convolution within realities.This is a reality within a reality within the universal reality.Local realities can vary in size and number of interactive entities.An example of a local reality is one that can be as big as a sector within a galaxy and down to being as small as the population of a planet within the physical universe.Local realities are normally created when a group of entities choose to not only change the function of their interaction with the overall reality,but actively choose to disassociate any previous knowledge of the former reality. The Locally Individualized Reality is relative to small groups of entities within a local reality,such as those living within a certain country.In this instance,they are aware of the local reality but are unable,for whatever reason but normally due to lack of collective inertia,to change the reality that has been changed for them by more influential entities who wish to create a reality that is for their own overall benefit and have the power to create the inertia necessary to make a localized individualized reality. The Individualized Reality is what entities with individualized free will choose to create around you.Although you inherently know the local and locally individualized reality you exist within,you choose to weave a reality that suits yourselves-your personality, close friends and relatives,needs,desires,and wants.In some instances,the fully individualized reality can create full separation from the reason for incarnation and sight of the levels of reality around you.Even as incarnate mankind,you are able to change and manipulate your own individual reality bringing into play any possible combination of interpretations of what reality is,could be,should be,and what you would like it to be-in effect making your own individualized multiverses. ME:Looking at this,a reality is really what we make it! SE1:That's right.What's more,an entity can create a"surrogate reality." ME:What's a surrogate reality?I have never heard of that description before. SE1:You won't have.A surrogate reality is one that is overlaid onto the individual reality by the acceptance of a reality created by another entity for a short period of experience. ME:We accept someone else's reality in place of our own? SE1:Yes.In fact,you would be surprised to note that this is quite a regular practice.

ME:OK,OK,how does the surrogate reality work then?I am guessing that it is one where the entity decides that their own reality is not good enough or desirable enough and decides to use the reality of another as a substitute. SE1:Close.You see,as I stated a moment ago,the surrogate reality is overlaid upon the individual's reality as a function of desire and lack of ownership of the reality they truly exist within. In effect,all realities are a subsection,or diversification from the original reality,the overall reality,with each subsection being created as a function of the entities/beings working within the multiversal environment they find themselves in.They modify it to suit their requirements,be it multiversal,universal,global,or individual.We/you create your reality based upon your interaction with the environment and its incumbent entities -this I have already stated.In the instance of the surrogate reality,it is created by another entity or group/collective of entities as a function of what they want to experience.The entity/ies who is/are dissatisfied with its/their current reality may desire to exist within another reality but actually cannot due to the constraints of their own interactions within their environment.They are simply not able to manifest or create the conditions that allow them to change their own reality to one that is similar or same as the one they desire.As a result,they live in the reality they have and can create,but dip in and out of a reality that is not theirs by acting out the roles that they would have had,had they been able to change their current reality to the reality that they desire.In effect,they exist in two realities,one that is their true reality and the other that is someone else's reality.

I will give you an example of an entity who has taken on a surrogate reality by using the human condition. ME:Thank you.I can already feel the words coming through and know the explanation of the example. SE1:Well,if you feel you already know,I will let you describe the example. ME:OK,I will do my best.From what I can see here,and using as you said,the human condition as the example,it's like when someone lives in the shadow of another and does everything they can to emulate the reality of that other person.As a result,they may dress,behave,and act like they would do if they were in the reality of that person,but they may not have the capability of supporting themselves and their actions when trying to be in that reality.As a result,the use of that reality as the surrogate may actually create a degradation of their own reality by making them unable to support themselves as let's say financial overindulgence.In fact,I am feeling that there may well be a rejection of the consequences as not being part of their reality.This rejection occurs because they can't believe the degradation-that being a change of circumstances that makes one's existence harder,but where one is not able to actually"see"how and why those changes happened.Therefore,they create a fictional reality that bridges the gap between where their true individual reality was,the desired surrogate individual reality,and the degraded true individual reality.This erases the reason for and the memory of the actions of the entity based upon its desires to exist in the surrogate reality 100 percent of the time,even though it doesn't have the capacity to do so.

I would call this disbelief. Based upon this then,the use of the surrogate reality has a detrimental effect on the true individual reality resulting in the lack of control of that reality and further dissatisfaction. The surrogate reality,being somebody else's,cannot be affected by its user and so a feeling of being out of control in both the true individual reality and the surrogate reality in their combined states is experienced by the entity,who loses touch with which reality it is actually in.What?I have just picked up that this leads to psychosis???!!! SE1:Yes,it does.One way to observe yourself moving into a surrogate reality is to notice yourself being dissatisfied with yourself and your environment to the point where you daydream about being in that other reality and plan things out as if you were actually in that reality for real. ME:We all do that to some extent.I mean,I do! SE1:Yes,you do,but in your instance you are using visualization to create the next phase of your reality,you are looking ahead rather than just wanting to be in an alternative reality,a surrogate reality. ME:And that's a significant difference? SE1:Yes,it is.In effect those who use a surrogate reality have the same mental processes of one who "wishes"that they were in that reality,rather than working on creating that reality.

ME:OK,you stated that the surrogate reality is a temporary condition.Why is this? SE1:Eventually the conditions that allow the ability to work with the surrogate reality as an overlay to the true individual reality cannot be sustained and the entity falls back into its true individual reality,whether it is maintained as being the same as it was when the entity overlaid the surrogate reality or whether it is a degraded but new version of the true individual reality.In this instance,one could argue that the interaction with the surrogate reality was a function of the true individual reality from the perspective that it was a tool required to make the changes to the true individual reality that are a necessary experiential requirement that the entity chose to make before,in this human example, incarnation. ME:But that means that the surrogate reality was a true reality. SE1:Yes,it does-in essence,but not in reality. ME:Time to move on,I feel. SE1:Yes,we should. ME:Wait a moment.We need to describe the function of multiversal environments within Event Streams.What happens to them,how are they affected,and do they affect the Event Stream itself? SE1:It's interesting that you decided to ask this question just before we were to move on to the Orchestrators!

ME:Why? SE1:Because you almost missed it,and because they have to work with the changes to the multiversal environment/s that arise from the changes to the Event Stream they are aligned to. ME:Hold on.This suggests that the statement you made earlier,that "The multiversal environment/s provide the basis for the events and Event Streams to exist,primarily because they are the foundation for the creation of event/s"is incorrect.This suggests that it is entities within the multiversal environment that create changes to the events.Event Space is created by a decision process and an Event Stream is therefore a series of events that are not specifically,but do not ignore,a linear progression. SE1:I think you have missed the thread of our discussion here. ME:Quite possibly. SE1:If you remember,it is the decisions made by the entities within a multiverse that creates the need for a new Event Space to be invoked.It is the creation of a new Event Space that results in the start of an Event Stream and the possibility of a subsequent Event Stream which is ultimately a function of the primary or originating Event Space and Event Stream as a "branch"from the originating Event Space and Event Stream.The changes to the multiversal environment that creates this new branch of events and space to support those events,the Event Spaces and the Event Streams,also have a reverse effect on the multiverse that they are aligned to.This means that whatever decisions are made within the multiverse that create new Event Spaces and Event Streams also create new multiversal conditions.In effect,the entities affect the multiverse which affects Event Space which affects the Event Stream which in turn affects the multiverse,and so on and so forth. ME:That's a rather long-winded way of saying that the one affects the other! SE1:Yes,it was,but it was necessary to describe the process,even in its very simple state, a number of times to ensure that it is absorbed. ME:OK,let's continue and draw a line under this subject.I am starting to get a headache! SE1:I will send you healing energies. ME:Thank you. SE1:You asked about the function of multiversal environments within Event Streams. What happens to them,how are they affected,and do they affect the Event Stream itself? ME:Yes,I did. SE1:As I have said before,the function of a multiverse is to create the basis for the possibility,probability,inevitability,or eventuality conditions necessary for the invocation of an Event Space and its associated branches of stream.They affect the Event Streams by being the basis for new Event Spaces to be invoked.Each new Event Space has the ability to create a new Event Stream as a natural product of its own creation thereby diluting the Event Conditions and changing them from either possibility to probability or inevitability to eventuality,to illustrate an example.The changes to the Event Streams, created by new Event Spaces within the multiversal environment/s create a change in the multiversal environment as a function of the change in the incumbent entities' interaction with one another and the multiverse they are working within again and again and again. There you are,I have explained the process all over again but in a different way. ME:I thought that there would be much more to the question. SE1:Only insomuch as it has added around six hundred words to the book that may not have been entirely necessary. ME:OK,you have got me. SE1:There are only certain ways and certain depths in which this information can be broadcast.All you and your readers need to know in this instance is that everything affects each other.Sometimes,though,I need to repeat myself to ensure that it sinks in! ME:Doesn't that create a self-perpetuating spiral of change? SE1:No,and that's the beauty of this discussion.The spiral can be changed or terminated by the actions of the entities within the multiversal environment.

ME:And in the instance that a spiral is terminated by the actions of the incumbent entities,everything would return back to the originating Event Space and Event Stream. SE1:From their particular point of origin,yes. ME:And there are many points of origin? SE1:Yes.BUT,all eventually lead to the Main Event Space and the Main Event Stream. ME:Is that possible? SE1:Of course!It's an inevitability!

ME:Why? SE1:Because at the end of the day,the evolutionary cycle comes to an end and I/we start again.For us to start again,we need to have experienced all that can be experienced,in all of its diversity in my current particular location within The Origin,and,when that happens,all Events,Spaces,Streams,conditions,and environments become one. ME:Got it! SE1:Time for the Orchestrators to come to the fore.

## The Orchestrators 

I was starting to notice something,no,not something,two things about the information I was channeling.First,that there is a lot of peripheral information surrounding the subjects that I am dealing with and that it is not always linked to the subject heading.I felt like we were digressing on a regular basis.Second,that this information,although at first doesn't have any relevance,does indeed have relevance further on down the line of discussion.This,I am establishing,is a function of subjective opportunity on behalf of The Source Entity,who knows where the timing surrounding the introduction of a specific idea,concept,or description is incorrect for the initial dialogue,but is ultimately correct in temporal relationship with the information that is to follow.Simply put,SE1 knows when to slip in agolden nugget or two now to assist in future subjects of discussion. I am sure though that you,dear reader,will have already sussed this out and will be wondering why it has taken me so long to spot it.Well,I will say this,sometimes it is very difficult to see the wood for the trees and from where I am sitting,there are an awful lot of trees and there is an awful lot of wood!This being said,all of these digressions form part of the bigger picture. It would be boring to concentrate on the one small part of the picture without sitting back on occasion to gain a glimpse of some parts of the bigger picture,specifically when these glimpses help one to understand the little part of the picture we are working on understanding. In thinking in this way,Ifelt happy about the digressions,knowing that ultimately they are just as important as the information relating to the subject heading.I felt the need to move on-QUICKLY! ME:Do you want to summarize the work of the Orchestrators? SE1:I thought I would let you do that. ME:I will try not to just cut and paste the information you summarized. The Orchestrators are like managers;they control the work specified by the Planners.The Orchestrators operate at all of the levels associated with the work and activities of the Planners,operating a top-to-bottom approach to the management of the changes/creations required to be actioned.They are involved from the start to the finish of any of the actions initiated by the Planners. SE1:Good start.I couldn't have done better myself. ME:Well,it was your summary. SE1:Yes,it was.As you know,though,this is just a minor overview and in no way gives any indication of the detail that the Orchestrators work on. Individuality:A Natural Function of the Growth of Sentience(An Informative Digression) As The Source was talking to me,I started to feel a little lost in the subject.I started to gain some information that,from my mind,almost negated the need for this extended dialogue and ultimately this book.What I mean is that everything and every entity in control of certain aspects of the multiverse/s were more than just linked together.I could see that although they were working for and in support of each other,they were,moreover,all the same being. Additionally,that the beings I had just started to discuss,that is all the beings we had written about so far in the book,which included all those to come,were just human expressions of functionality,of individuality.It very much felt like these beings were just facets of specialized functionality within The Source that were designed to maintain and manipulate the area or volume of its structure-its self,that was a further larger-much larger area of specialization used as an environment,specialized for reasons of automatic evolutionary growth.All of this included us,or should I say our TES and us as projected aspects of TES. Everything is one,everything is a function of The Source,and there is no real individualization.Individualization is a function of incarnate mankind's thinking process which in itself is a function of the near total isolation of the Aspect from the TES resulting from the insertion into the lowest frequencies of the multiverse and a vehicle to experience them through.We are but quarks in the atomic structure of The Source,quarks with a purpose. That made me start to think more when The Source interjected. SE1:Yes,of course everything is one.Just as incarnate beings are smaller specialized functions of me,so am I a smaller specialized function of The Origin.Everything is one,all of the functions repeat themselves up and down,forward and backward,left and right of the scale,so to speak. ME:It's just that I started to think that trying to explain everything in terms of separate isolated and individualized entities is futile when we think in the "all is one"thought process. SE1:You could and you can argue that,but I will give you an example as to why it is beneficial to think in the way of individuality as well. This is going to be a showstopper,I thought.I knew in the back of my mind that the accepted higher spiritual thinking process resides in support of the formless and the concept,the ultimate truth,that "all is one."This is going to be difficult to explain to the higher thinkers because individuality,in their/our minds,is a backward step. SE1:Why is it a backward step when it is part of the Greater Truth surrounding the Greater Reality? ME:What?What do you mean? This is not the start to this chapter of the book I was thinking of.Why do we need to consider individuality within the context of the Greater Truth and Greater Reality? SE1:Because it's a function of what it is.Listen,I will explain this again for you and your readers. The Origin is an individualized function of sentience within a vast unfathomable area or volume of "all there is"-it is "all there is"as a result.As an individualized function of sentience,that sentience can and does grow.As it grows so does the need for specialization of that sentience.The need for specialized aspects of sentience is therefore a natural evolutionary condition that occurred as a result of The Origin's desire to experience and express itself.When sentience desires experience,it is limited by its own individuality so it divides its sentience into specialized areas of sentience assigning it "a body of energy"[some energy to work with-GSN].These areas of sentience,through specialization, gain individuality,a personality if you like,allowing the larger area or volume to experience different things simultaneously rather than individually.So,individuality gives birth to simultaneousness as a function of collective individuality,which is a function of synergy. Without specialized aspects of sentience,there can be no progress or evolutionary growth, there can be no Origin,no Source Entities,no Om,no TES,no Aspects of TES,and no Shards of Aspects of TES. Yes,everything is one,but one,being "all there is,"is full of areas of individualized and specialized units of sentience,and sentience given a body of energy to express, experience,learn,and evolve through.BUT-you all say-individuality does not exist in the Greater Reality.Individuality is a temporary illusion.I will say this:individuality is the maintenance of the illusion of individuality,and as such exists,for the illusion cannot exist without the prerequisite conditions that allow it to exist in the first place.In this case,the prerequisite is the creation of individuality or specialization of sentience which in itself creates individuality. So,in summary then,those small areas or volumes of individualized sentience,given a body of energy,upon gaining specialization also gain personality as a function of the signature that sentience gains through specialization.That signature is a function which can be used as a name,the name also describing the function creating a function-the individuality-specialization loop.This therefore justifies the demarcation of specialized sentient energy as individualized "beings"in their own right,and,in your case,the need to describe them,their function,and their corresponding signature or name-hence the need for this book. ME:You were reading my mind again! SE1:Of course and always.That's how I communicate with you.That's how we all,that is everything,communicates in the Greater Reality. Having justified the need for individualization/specialization of sentience given a body of energy and the reason for names to describe the function and signature of that sentience,I felt much happier.Everything can be individualized and or specialized while remaining a function of "all there is"and therefore being one.It all made sense. And Back to the Orchestrators! ME:The Orchestrators-seems like the name describes the function nicely. SE1:All of the names used in this dialogue are designed to be informational and descriptive in the human sense,and this is no exception.It would make no sense to describe something in a way that had no relationship to the current level of knowledge of incarnate mankind; even if it is cutting edge,it needs to have a common datum.The Orchestrators as a descriptor is no exception to this. ME:You are sending me an image again,one where I can see the Orchestrators literally flying around from one place to another,managing the work of the Planners. SE1:That is one way of seeing it.The Orchestrators are,for want of a better word,the managers of the multiverse. Before I continue,though,I have come to a conclusion about the depth of information we need to work with here.I know that most of the dialogue to date has revolved around the wider environment,including the more diverse functions of Event Space and Event Streams and its effect on the multiverse at all levels of interaction from collective to local and individualized.This I feel is OK for now,and,that from this point onward,I feel that we need to focus on the multiverse from a static perspective,one that is based upon the dominant structure of the multiverse and not the variations and causes for variations that can be observed,manipulated,and experienced as a result of the interaction of the incumbent entities.Although,even though I say this,it is possible that we have to make reference to the wider subject if necessary. ME:I understand but I feel that incarnate mankind can deal with this level of detail.I mean, it's not all that deep,is it?And I wouldn't want to think that we are withholding something from the readers. SE1:We can delve into the depth as appropriate.It's just that I want to focus on the basic management of the multiverse for the moment at least.As you request,we will delve into the detail if it is appropriate to the overall understanding of what is being described. ME:Good.We all appreciate it.However,I do want to understand why you wanted to limit the depth of the information,the real reason,that is? SE1:It's simply a matter of popular understanding.To date,and this includes the text in this dialogue,the information you,I,the entities you have created a dialogue with, including the other Source Entities and The Origin,has been difficult for most people to understand.Being difficult makes it less popular and only available to those who are able to work at this level.I wanted to ensure that from now on,we can make it more available. However,I see that upon reflection,we have already missed that particular boat,and editing this text to make it easier to understand would be detrimental to the subject matter. I propose,again,that we keep it simple and note that,as spiritual people always state,it will be useful to those who need to know and can use it for their own progression.My other thought is that most readers will look at this only from the perspective of the physical universe and not the overall multiversal environment. I was a little confused here as The Source is usually decisive about things.This showed an element of indecisiveness and for me,some cause for concern.Fortunately,this was quickly "jumped on"by The Source,who further defended the decision with ease. SE1:What you can't see is the level of detail that we can get into that is beyond the remit of the title of this book.It is always important to give what is expected from the title and not digression.Having said that,a little digression is good light entertainment,especially when the information is difficult to grasp.It allows the information to sink in slowly. Now then,the Orchestrators appeared to you as being here,there,and everywhere because they work on all aspects of the structure of the multiversal environment from full dimension to subfrequency,which includes the content within the subfrequential levels.The Orchestrators are the first level of Curators that are involved with multiversal environmental content and not just structure or the effect on structure appropriated by those entities that work within the structure to evolve. ME:Do you mean that they work on both structural and content maintenance? SE1:Yes.We can break it down into functions later,and maybe they are best described in terms of the chapters that focus on the physical universe,but because in real terms they work above the frequencies of the physical,they are best described here. The Orchestrators apportion groups of entities that are dedicated only to doing the work and not specialized areas of work. ME:Hold on,are you suggesting that there are nonspecialized entities? SE1:I would call them General Entities.Their specialism if you like is to be nonspecific to any particular task.They accept the opportunity to work with any aspect of the maintenance of the multiverse and delight in doing so.They enjoy the diversification associated with not being specialized and draw great individualized progression from being in general use.In some respects,these entities-entities that have no specialization and therefore no name, and up to now,no place in this dialogue/book-are the most capable entities within the roles and responsibilities of the Curators.I think that we should deal with them after the description of the Orchestrators and give them the recognition that they deserve. ME:I agree. SE1:Getting back to the subject at hand then.The Orchestrators use the generalized maintenance entities to work on both the structural functions of the multiversal environment and the content within it.These entities work in parallel with the specialized entities that are required for areas of operational focus. This is important because the specialized entities are just as they are described,specialized, and deal with the detail behind their specialism,whereas the generalized entities can work on both the higher levels of the specialized areas of focus and the links between them. The general entities therefore move between the specialisms creating a homogeneous representation of the desires of the Orchestrators within the different areas of structure and content that they work with. ME:Forgive me for saying so,but this looks like the generalized entities do all of the work and the Orchestrators do nothing but manage the work required and the entities that are assigned to do that work! SE1:That is why they are called the Orchestrators.

ME:This particular description is destined to be short I expect because their role is somewhat obvious. SE1:Is it? ME:Mmm...I feel that you are playing with me a little,like,their role is somewhat bigger. SE1:Of course,it is.As I started to say,the Orchestrators are the first,or should I say,the highest of the Curators,considering the top-down description we have had to date,that are involved with both the structure and the content within that structure. When involved with the structure of the multiversal environment,they ensure that the main stream,or for want of a better word,the static unchanging aspects of what the multiverse is,from an evolutionary perspective,are maintained as such,in an unchanged state.There has to be a dominant structure,a mainstream structure to evolve through,and it is the role of the Orchestrators to ensure that this dominant structure is maintained. ME:We have discussed this before when we talked about main Event Streams and that everything that is created through choice is a variation from the main Event Stream and main Event Space.We have also talked about all of the different levels of multiversal environment that are created by the incumbent entities and the choices they make,so what is so special about the Orchestrators maintaining a static multiversal structure? SE1:The overall requirement for all of my creations is to experience all of that which I have given to be experienced.How you all experience it is up to you.The series of choices that are made by you while progressing through the structure of my creation is therefore individualized.I created a segmentation of my own structure to be used for experiential and evolutionary purposes,and through changes brought about by all of your individual and collective decisions,that which is me therefore changes to that which you desire to experience. As with the creation of different Event Space and Event Streams,the multiverse has a vast number of multiversal and therefore universal environmental variants that fit in with the changes to the events that are created through choice,each of them are a deviation from the originating and therefore dominant multiversal and universal structure.The Orchestrators ensure that this dominant,original,or primary structure and the content that is associated with it is maintained as such.They,along with the entities that work with them,work on all levels of the multiversal/universal structure and content,making modifications to the changes created by the incumbent entities to make sure the originating content and structure is maintained as such.There can be no changes made to the originating structure and its content for this is the datum that everything that is experienced and created is compared to.Everything else is just an illusion,a temporary condition based upon ultimate choice.[After this text was written,I was told by The Source that an illusion that is experienced can also be classified as a reality,even if it is temporary.- GSN] ME:So do the Orchestrators only work on maintaining the originating structure and content?

SE1:Primarily,yes,but ultimately,no.They keep the originating multiversal structure and its content as it was in its newborn state,so to speak,in the way it was when I created it, or should I say,segmented it.Everything is unchanged,everything is pure,everything is perfect.The Orchestrators work on all levels to keep it this way. ME:So when in the Traversing the Frequencies workshops,we project our consciousness into the self-contained simultaneous universal environments that are within the multiversal structure,do we visit the originating multiversal environments or do we visit the variations that we individually and collectively create through choice? SE1:You move into the originating multiversal/universal environments,while your incarnate aspect remains in the individually and collectively created variant of the multiverse and its universal environments. ME:We are in two places then? SE1:No,you are in as many places as you have had decisions from both an Aspect of your TES and your TES itself.You,as the Aspect,are in the universal variant resulting from individual and collective choice while your TES remains within the originating universal environment within the multiverse that it is associated to as a result of its evolutionary level. ME:So our TES is not affected by choice,or the different Event Streams and Event Spaces that are created by us as Aspects of our TES then?

SE1:Indirectly,yes,because you as a projection of your TES are working within a universal variant and its content of the originating multiversal/universal environments that has been/is being created and modified through individual and collective choice within the location of your Aspect.However,from the perspective of evolutionary progression of the TES,this is a stable and static structural function and as such is still as it was when I created it. The Orchestrators therefore work on maintaining the originating multiverse,its self- contained simultaneous universal structures and its content.This is achieved in terms of what is within the self-contained simultaneous universal environments as a tool for evolutionary progression of the TES.The Orchestrators also work on maintaining the variations of these self-contained simultaneous universal environments and their content that is created through individual and collective choice. Ensuring that the original multiversal/universal environments and their content is unchanged is a challenge but only requires one group of entities in one reality,one Event Stream and one Event Space,so to speak.Working on making the changes that ensure the structural and evolutional efficiency of the multiversal and universal environments and their content are in line with the decisions resulting from individual and collective choice in all of the Event Spaces and Event Streams is a bigger challenge,one that requires the Orchestrators to work within one environment and its content but within all of the variants that are made through choice.

ME:You talked about the Orchestrators working with two types of entities,specialists and generalists,and that the generalists are the most useful entities because they can be utilized across a whole range of specialisms,but not at the same depth as the specialists themselves. SE1:I did. ME:Does this include those entities that maintain the content,such as the nebulae, galaxies,and planets in the physical universe and the equivalent areas of local density in the other universal environments? SE1:Yes,it does,although those entities that work right in the detail of local areas of density you call planets are the most specialized entities within the Curators. ME:How do you mean? SE1:Think about it for a moment.The entities that you are talking about work on things like soil,grass,bacteria,a certain genre of tree or plant,or even the weather system.They are right at the front line of environmental maintenance.What's more,these entities are only working on their specialism on one planet in one part of the galaxy in one part of the universal environment that they are assigned to.They are not just specialized,they are highly specialized,and as a result there are very few generalist entities working at these levels. ME:So the Orchestrators wouldn't use generalists at these levels then?

SE1:Not unless there is a lot of work to be done that needs extra help ME:When would a Curator at this level require extra help? SE1:When the entities that are in the evolutionary cycle at the incarnate levels make a mess of the environment in a major way. ME:I guess the Earth is close to needing help now. SE1:Not in the areas you would think.You all focus on pollution,but the biggest issue is the loss of ecosystem components such as trees and smaller animals and fish.Pollution can be solved overnight by stopping the processes that create the pollution,but regeneration of the ecosystem needs to be done in line with the local Event Stream,which in your terminology means real time,so based on this,an ecosystem can take decades to recover, even with help. ME:This tells me that at the lowest levels the Orchestrators need to have one entity for one job,so to speak. SE1:Close.For each universal environment and its content within the multiverse there is a common but uniquely assigned group of entities specifically assigned to a universe.This means that the number of entities working on the maintenance of the environment is multiplied by the number of universes,at least. ME:I have just seen an overall image of the number of maintenance entities required at the physical levels of the multiverse,it's almost infinite,like there are more,much more working on the maintenance than actually involved in the evolutionary cycle,the number of entities working in the physical aspects of the multiverse,the physical universe, requiring more than others. SE1:Yes,that's correct.Although there are duplications in terms of the numbers of specialized and generalized entities working for the Orchestrators when one looks at each self-contained simultaneous universe,that being,they only work in a specific environment within a specific universe.There is more opportunity for these entities to work across universal environments,or be more generalized when they are assigned to those self- contained simultaneous universal environments that are contained within the higher frequencies of the multiverse. ME:I would have thought that the higher up the frequencies,the more entities are needed because the resolution of the frequencies is higher and therefore the environment can support more content. SE1:Not so.You see,as the frequency increases,so the abilities or functionality of the maintenance entity increases as well.As a result,the subsequent increase in workload is balanced out by the increase in functions and abilities available to the entity at that increased level. ME:That's a surprise. SE1:Why? ME:I didn't expect to hear that the Curators,at any level,are restricted in any way other than specialism. SE1:As you are aware,lack of functionality and connectivity is a function of the lower frequencies and everything and every entity is affected. ME:I thought that it was just incarnate entities that were affected by the lower frequencies? SE1:No,it affects all entities,and it is particularly difficult for those entities that are working in the frequencies associated with the physical universe.We will discuss this further when we work on describing the roles and responsibilities of those entities that work with the Earth. This was new news to me.In fact,I was very surprised.I fully believed that the entities that worked on the maintenance of the multiverse would be immune or outside of the rules or functions of the multiverse as we as incarnate entities would experience it.To find out that this was not the case was a real revelation.The Curators were bound by the same rules as the entities they were in service to!I didn't expect that one,and I don't suppose any of my readers or other metaphysisists or spiritual leaders would have either.On the other hand,though,it did make sense and it would help me forge more searching questions later on in this dialogue. What Does the Maintenance of an Environment Mean to a Maintenance Entity? This thought process has made me pause for further thought.Just what does maintenance of an environment mean to an entity?Especially,when the entities that maintain the environment are affected by the very nature of its frequential state.I know that I am repeating myself with this thought process but it's a good thing to do.It gets it clear in one's mind.I sat and considered this thought process for a moment.One:For each universal environment and its content within the multiverse there is a common but uniquely assigned group of entities -specifically assigned to a universe.This means that the number of groups is multiplied by the number of universes.Two:These entities are separated to work on essentially two versions of the environment they are assigned to,the original static environment,and those that are created in parallel by Event Space through the choices of the entities that are in the evolutionary cycle within the environments.Three:These entities have to work within the constraints of the environment they are assigned to work within,even though they are capable of working outside of the environment itself.The first two thoughts made sense,it was a process I could work with it just made sense.This last(third)thought made me think deeper and ask for guidance.First though,I was drawn to an image of a memory I had circa 2003 when meditating by the trees in the garden in the mornings with Anne before traveling to work.I saw a nature spirit,an Elemental.It was a ball of energy that changed shape,a rather spiky shape,to allow it to work on the plants in our garden.The notes I made were destined to become The History of God but I had no idea that they would resurrect themselves in this text.As I focused upon this memory, I remember thinking that this entity was very close to the frequencies of the Gross Physical but I had no further thoughts on this fact.Neither did I note that they must be seen by other incarnate entities that exist on the fourth frequency upward,so what does maintenance of an environment mean from the point of view of the entity? SE1:I can answer that one for you.As you will be aware from the dialogue we have had over the last few months [11 months-GSN],we have talked about the structure within the structure of the multiverse and its environments and that the entities that maintain these environments use this structure to both move around the environment and work within it. ME:Yes,we did,I am working on remembering it right now. SE1:Good.I will send you an image and some data to support the image. ME:I am receiving it.I can see more of the scene associated with the memory I have of the nature spirit/Elemental in 2003.Oh,there is more than I remember. SE1:There is more than you saw as well. ME:Go on;explain! SE1:What you are seeing in this image is what YOU saw and what REALLY happened.What you saw was just the entity working on the plants in your garden,tending to their energetic needs by linking them up,momentarily,to the energy vortex that is in your garden to boost their energies. ME:Yes,that's what I saw. SE1:The rest of the image is now what happened before and after the image you saw. The entity clearly was working on the fourth frequency,what you call the lower astral.On this level,the entity has to obey the laws of the multiverse attributed to this frequential state and so is limited as such.However,what you don't know is that these entities can work around the limitations by projecting an energetic sheath around them that maintains their natural frequential state and therefore their functionality.So,they are affected by the frequencies of the environments that they work with,but they can work around it.The issue here,though,is that in maintaining the frequential state of the entity,this sheath effectively stops correct interaction with the frequencies of the environment.The entity is therefore stuck in a cleft stick:interface with the environment and lose functionality,or shield itself and lose the ability to interact with that environment.In the higher universal environments,this is less of a problem but in the lowest of the frequencies,the physical universe,this is a real issue. ME:How do they get around it then? SE1:They allow part of themselves to be outside of the energy sheath whereas the major part of them stays within the energy sheath.In this way,they have the ability to work with the energies of the universal environment in the way they are supposed to,in the only way they are actually able to make their modifications while maintaining their functionality.If you look closely at the image I sent you,you will be able to understand. As I focused on the image The Source gave me,I was greeted by an interesting phenomenon. The entity I saw in 2003 was used as the example.The entity was as I saw it all those years ago,a ball of spiky energy floating over the grass.However,as I looked more closely,I noticed that the image was ever so slightly blurred.It took a lot of time to see this blurred state as the image was almost clear and crisp.As I looked closer,I noticed that there was a difference in the local crispness of the image.It was just slightly blurred up to the point of interaction with the plant it was working with.At the point of interface with the plant,the image became clear and crisp with no sign of blur.I also noticed that at the interface of this blurred area,there was a barely perceptible change in the color of the image;it was a rose or transparent pink color.This,I thought,must be the interface between the normal frequential state of the Elemental entity and the frequential state of the aspect of the plant that was represented by the fourth frequency.In this condition,the Elemental entity or nature spirit was able to continue to function according to its natural frequential state and deal with its workload in the frequencies associated with its areas of responsibility.It was fascinating to see the detail behind this old memory-based image.In the lowest frequencies,one has to work like a deep-sea diver using a dry suit,who, while at great depth,takes his glove/s off to work with more dexterity on the details of his work that cannot be dealt with while he has his gloves on.The body of the diver is in an air-based environment while his hands are in the water-based environment,a cuff seal keeping the water out of the main body of the dry suit while the hands are in the water to do the work-the diver is therefore in two environments concurrently. ME:Now I understand.A maintenance entity not only has to deal with its own responsibilities and workload,it also has to deal with the vagaries of the environment it is working in while maintaining its own frequential integrity.It's hard frequential work! SE1:Correct.And now you know,in summary,what it means to an entity to maintain an environment,because a maintenance entity needs to maintain its own local environment as well.In this way,it maintains,in this example,its own invisibility with those other incarnate vehicles that exist on the fourth frequency level allowing it to complete its work in an unnoticed and unencumbered way.

## The General Maintenance Entities 

I decided to move away from the mainstream discussion on the roles and responsibilities of the maintenance entities that I was given at the start of this dialogue and make a small detour to focus on the general maintenance entities that I was advised of during one of my recent communications with The Source,the General Maintenance Entities.I know that I discussed the roles of these entities to some degree before and I ask the reader for patience here.Ijust have a feeling that there is something very important and unique about them,something not apparent from the information that I have received so far.Their role seemed just a little too simple. SE1:You're getting better at seeing the leads I give you. ME:Oh,I feel like I have just passed a test or something! SE1:Not a test,just the ability to see the possibilities that are presented to you when they are presented to you. ME:It was a test then! SE1:Call it what you will,it keeps you on your toes and keeps your ability to question fresh. ME:OK,now I understand.Let's get straight to the point.What is it with the General Maintenance Entities that makes me want to go over this ground again? SE1:We briefly discussed that they are possibly the most important classification of Entity in the hierarchy of Curators,did we not? ME:Yes,we did. SE1:Then they deserve to be represented properly. ME:Well,that's really what I am asking for. SE1:I know,I am playing with you. ME:Again! SE1:Again.You need to lighten up a little and enjoy this role. ME:I know,I know. SE1:Good,I can see that you have lifted your spirits a little and now thatthat has happened we can start. The General Maintenance Entities are a universal resource.I use this statement because these entities are not just able to be used by any of the hierarchy of named entities previously discussed and due to be discussed,they can also take the place of any of these entities. ME:You mean they can be Orchestrators,Architects,or any of the other mainstream specialisms?

SE1:Correct.You see,they are not just,how would you call it,"dogs bodies,""gofers," or "laborers"-they are entities that are fully capable of taking on any of the roles and responsibilities in the structure and hierarchy of the entities called the Curators. ME:They really are fully universal. SE1:Yes,they are.The General Maintenance Entities need no instruction or training in terms of the work that they are enlisted to work on,they just pick it up. ME:What do you mean,just pick it up? SE1:I will explain further.Whereas the other entities,at all levels,are specialized for and by the work that they elected to do and/or were chosen to do,these entities choose to be generalized,so to speak. ME:Generalized!What do you mean by saying generalized? SE1:They have the ability to "program"themselves,if you like.They change their specialism from being general to being the specialism that is required for the role they are asked to perform in the short term. ME:Ah,so their role is only considered to be a short-term condition when they are asked to perform a role? SE1:Yes,it is always a short-term role that they are employed to work on. ME:So what you are suggesting is that they are blank,sort of neutral,role-wise,until they are asked to perform the role they are asked to do. SE1:That's one way of saying it,yes. ME:So,they do the role,then they go blank until they go to the next role? SE1:In a way,yes.When they have finished a role,they have an option.In fact,they have a number of options. ME:You mean they can choose what to do next,what their role is going to be next? SE1:Yes and no.I will elaborate.At any point in their role,they can be called upon to stop the work they are doing,change role,or go back into an area in the environment where they can wait for their next role.Additionally,they can elect to stay in a role if continuous additional resource is required or they can seek a new role.The opportunities they have are therefore as follows: Stop work:In this instance the General Maintenance Entity has two options to consider. One,they are being requested to stop work because the need for them as a resource is no longer applicable for the role they are currently in.After this,they will then return to generalization.Two,do they feel that their contribution is no longer necessary and that if they stay in the role they are currently in they will create inefficiency?Once this decision has been made,the entity returns itself to generalization. Change roles:Is a function of the entity either requesting a role from any of the other entities within the specialized hierarchy of the Curators,or seeing a role and individually electing to go into that role on a permanent basis.In this and all instances of role activation, the generalization of the entity is rescinded and the entity becomes specialized.Note that this only happens when it is recognized that there is a need for a more specialized resource, so to speak,within a certain function within the multiversal environment that the General Maintenance Entity was working within. Swap roles:It is possible for a General Maintenance Entity to actively swap roles with a specialized entity.In this instance,the General Maintenance Entity gives up its "generalization"and becomes "fixed"into permanence,so to speak,in the role it has taken from the specialized entity with which it has made an agreement to swap.The previously specialized entity therefore becomes the General Maintenance Entity actively inheriting all of the functions and experiences of the previous General Maintenance Entity.The previously generalized entity also inherits the functions,experiences,and experience of the previously specialized entity.In this instance,the swapping process is nonreversible from the perspective of the entity that was the General Maintenance Entity because it is no longer generalized.Indeed,the only way it can return to being generalized is if the entity it swapped with requests the swapping process to be reversed by actively swapping with the entity it swapped with in the first instance.Alternatively,though,the previous General Maintenance Entity,now specialized,can return to specialization if another General Maintenance Entity elects to swap roles with it.In this instance,it inherits the functions and experiences of the General Maintenance Entity it swaps with and not those it had in its previous generalized state.

Stay in a role:Staying in a role is usually at the request of a specialized entity if it sees the need for the General Maintenance Entity to continue in the current role it is being employed in.This is usually requested if there is a significant amount of work to do relative to the temporary state of specialism that was not previously understood. Return to neutrality (generalization):Returning to neutrality or generalization is the normal decision that a General Maintenance Entity takes when a role is no longer necessary or is close to being no longer necessary.The decision to return to generalization can be made by either the employing specialized entity or the General Maintenance Entity itself, although it is a natural function pertaining to the existing role no longer being necessary. When an entity returns to generalization,it moves into an area of noneffectiveness within the structure of the multiverse,a sort of "employment pool"using your language where it simply "is"in a state of beingness rather than activity. Request a role(ask specialized entities for a role):The General Maintenance Entity can actively request a role from any of the specialized entities defined in the Curator hierarchy should it desire to do so.The role offered,being based upon the need for additional resource in the specialism of the offering entity,will be of a temporary nature and as previously stated only available while there is a shortfall of resource versus the workload necessary to support the function of the multiverse that is in need of support.Note that it is not usual for a General Maintenance Entity to request a role for most of the time the request for a General Maintenance Entity's support within a function of Curator specialization comes from that specialist function itself,negating the need for the request.

Elect to be in a role (individualized decision):In this instance,the General Maintenance Entity may decide that it no longer desires to be generalized or neutral and seeks a role on a permanent basis.This is not the same as a request for a swap of roles and so does not involve another specialized entity.In this instance,the General Maintenance Entity seeks a permanent role within the specializations of the Curator hierarchy through a request of role through the specialized entities.The election to be in a role can take two forms. The first form is that the General Maintenance Entity requests a role and accepts what is available at the time of the request,if any.Or,if there are a number of roles,the requesting General Maintenance Entity makes a decision based upon the desirability of the role to it.The second form is when the General Maintenance Entity requests a specific role and is prepared to wait for that role to become available.In this instance,the entity will need to stay generalized within the area of noneffectivity and not enter into a temporary specialized role because if the entity entered into temporary specialization,it would not be able to take advantage of the role it desired due to being actively employed in a necessary function within the specializations of the Curator hierarchy. ME:How do they change from one role or specialism to another?What is the process they use?We don't seem to have discussed that yet. SE1:No,we haven't.I have deliberately left the description of the changing and swapping process to last. ME:Oh,OK!

SE1:So here we go.I will describe the swapping process and changing processes individually,although they are similar in function. The swapping process is a function of moving the sentience of the entity from one "body' of energy to another.It is the energy associated with the sentience that is key here,for the function of being generalized is attributed to the energy that is assigned to the sentience and not the sentience itself.If you remember in previous dialogues with The Origin [see The Origin Speaks-GSN],it is sentience that defines the entity and not the energy that the sentience is assigned to or that the sentience commandeers.So when the sentience of a General Maintenance Entity moves from its body of energy,it is only the sentience that moves and not the functionality of the energy which the sentience can animate.Similarly, when the specialist entity moves its sentience from its body of specialized energy,it only moves its sentience and not the specialized function of the body of energy it was associated with.So,each "Sentient"entity,in moving its sentience to its new body of energy,inherits the functionality and experiences of that energy when it assigns itself to that body of energy.Swapping back is a reverse of the initial swapping process.Permanence in a specialism is simply a function of not swapping back. The changing process is a variation on the swapping process that does not require the sentience of the General Maintenance Entity to be moved from its generalized body of energy to a body of energy with the functionality of the specialism it will be temporarily associated with.In this instance,a percentage of specialized energy from a donating specialized entity,up to 30 percent,is absorbed by the General Maintenance Entity to allow it to work in the way,and with the functions of,the specialized energy whose role it is assigned to,or has requested to work with.When the work is completed,the specialized energy is released from its absorbed state from the General Maintenance Entity and is reabsorbed by the donating specialist entity. A Matter of Direct Responsibility ME:Is there anything else that you can tell me about the General Maintenance Entities? SE1:There is always more to tell you.You just don't have enough lifetime left to be able to go through all of it. ME:What do you mean by that? SE1:Simply that you will never have enough time to be able to work on everything that is available to know.That is why I have so many incarnates delivering the information. Everyone works on a small piece of the jigsaw puzzle.Everyone overlaps each other in some small,or other,way. ME:Yes,OK.But,what about the entities we have just been discussing? SE1:That is enough for the moment;you have all that you need. ME:OK.Can I have one last question about the General Maintenance Entities then? SE1:OK.Carry on.

ME:We have discussed the process of being close to the lower frequencies of the multiverse and that an entity needs to create a protective shield around them to allow them to function at their own level while in these lower frequencies. SE1:Yes,we have. ME:Well,my question is this:Do any of the General Maintenance Entities work on the Gross Physical frequency levels?If so,do they manifest a Gross Physical body to work on that level?And,are they still able to function correctly at this level? SE1:They do,but it is a rare occurrence. ME:How rare? SE1:Very rare. ME:What makes them need to materialize a Gross Physical body? SE1:There are times when direct intervention is required,the sort of intervention with the Gross Physical that cannot be actioned by the genre of Curators you call Elementals and can only be actioned by an entity that can change itself in the way just described.They don't actually materialize a body. ME:Are you saying that they can do work that Elementals cannot perform?

SE1:Yes.We will get on to the subject of the genre of Curators called Elementals or nature spirits later,but to get to the point,yes.You see Elementals can only work in the frequencies that are attributed to the astral;they cannot work on the third frequency and below. This got me thinking for a moment.If a General Maintenance Entity cannot materialize a body and an Elemental cannot work in the environment associated with the third frequency,then the only way to work directly with the third frequency is to commandeer a Gross Physical body. Hold on,I thought guides can manifest a Gross Physical body,so why can't a Curator?Now I was curious. ME:OK,this means that they would need to swap with an entity that was incarnate? SE1:Yes,it would.It means the General Maintenance Entity has to invoke a walk-in. ME:But if a Guide can manifest a Gross Physical body,why can't a Curator? SE1:Because it has to stay with the genre of frequencies associated with its role- that being,it exists in a subfrequential state that allows it to work within,without,in and around the structure of the multiverse and its local universal environments.They can affect changes to the multiverse and its structure/evolutionary efficiency,but cannot operate within the function of the multiverse that is associated with the evolutionary cycle per se. ME:I still haven't got it.Neither a Guide nor its Helpers are in the evolutionary cycle but the Guide can manifest a Gross Physical body.

SE1:Agreed,but there is a difference.ME:And that difference is? SE1:They are not in the evolutionary cycle,but they work with entities that are in the evolutionary cycle. ME:But so do the Curators.They support the maintenance of the environment that allows the ability of entities in the evolutionary cycle to evolve. SE1:Yes,they do.The difference is that the Guide and Helpers are,although not in the evolutionary cycle,directly responsible for the evolutionary progression of those entities in the evolutionary cycle.The Curators are not directly responsible so they do not have access to energies that allow direct intervention from the perspective of the entities within the evolutionary cycle and are using the process of incarnation to augment their evolutionary progression. ME:So,from where I am standing,there are three genres of energy being used in the multiverse that entities are aligned to:structural,evolutionary,and an energy that is a mixture of structure and evolutionary. SE1:That's a reasonable description-but note that there are many more genres than those three. ME:I expect there are. SE1:Getting back to your question,though,the General Maintenance Entity has to invoke a walk-in to allow direct Gross Physical intervention.

ME:If the General Maintenance Entity is in effect "incarnate,"how can it use its functionality,considering of course that the lowest frequencies of the multiverse effectively restrict the communication and functional performance of an entity? SE1:The General Maintenance Entity,when invoking a walk-in,also invokes a temporary increase in communicative and functional bandwidth,one that is protected.This requires a lot of energy,though,and as such the walk-in can only be affected for a limited period before the entity has to return the body to its primary Aspect(Soul). ME:What does the General Maintenance Entity do when in the walk-in?How do we recognize an incarnate vehicle that has been commandeered by a General Maintenance Entity? SE1:First,the Gross Physical body has the appearance of detachment from its normal duties and responsibilities and performs in a way that is out of character.Standard stuff for a walk-in.In this instance,though,the General Maintenance Entity will steer the body it has commandeered to a location,using the Earth as an example,where it is needed.The Gross Physical body is then used as an anchor point for the energies it needs to use to make the direct intervention work. ME:So what is direct intervention in this instance? SE1:Direct intervention can be invoking a weather system,a change to the magnetosphere, or the use of a volcano or earthquake to stabilize the energies of the planet.It can be anything else associated with major or localized environmental change as well.

ME:Would the primary Aspect know that they are making these changes on this scale? SE1:The Aspect would,but the ego created as a result of the incarnation process would not,and so when the Gross Physical body is released,it may feel like it was in a haze for a few days to weeks or was having some strange dreams,dreams of having immense power. Another way the ego may register an abnormal experience may be by the loss of memory for the duration of the walk-in or suddenly being woken up in a different location from that previously experienced and remembered. ME:What other ways may a General Maintenance Entity use a walk-in as a way for effecting change to the environment,be it the Earth or any other? SE1:There are times when interaction with the incarnate population is required. ME:When would that happen? SE1:If there is a need to change the way the incarnate population is interacting with the environment and that if the way the populous interact is such that any changes made by the General Maintenance Entity are negated within a short period of time,they will need also to change the thought processes of the incarnates.In this instance,an incarnate is chosen that is in the right location and maybe the right level of influence to make change to the minds and hearts of the population to the point where the work of the General Maintenance Entities is not undone.

ME:So who would be a likely person to be taken over as a walk-in by a General Maintenance Entity? SE1:That depends upon the work to be done.However,the way to see if an incarnate's vehicle has been commandeered by a General Maintenance Entity is if the incarnate makes a significant and out-of-character change to the way it interacts with others and the direction it decides to take with its career or hobbies/pastimes.The usual individuals are those who are in a position of some sort of influence over others,or could be of influence over others.An individual who can be considered to be a champion for the cause. ME:I guess that would describe politicians or industrialists or celebrities that suddenly turn into environmentalists. SE1:It depends.It is not just prominent individuals that are chosen.It's the primary location and interactive properties of the individual that is most important. ME:I have to admit that I am surprised that General Maintenance Entities use a walk-in as a way to effect changes to the local environment. SE1:When they are working at the lowest frequencies of the multiverse and need to ensure that the changes they must make are to be permanently introduced in a way that is supported by the incarnate population,they have the capability to use any means possible to them. ME:That is,if they are required to work in that environment.

SE1:Naturally. I was just about to draw a line under the subject of the General Maintenance Entities when I had a feeling that we were not yet finished,not quite anyway.There was something more about these entities that needed to be broadcast before we moved on.Something quite unique-again! ME:I was about to finish here but I feel you have a little more to tell me about these entities. SE1:Yes.There is one thing that you could do with knowing. ME:I am all ears. SE1:General Maintenance Entities are not generally in abundance. ME:What do you mean? SE1:Although there is a nominal number of General Maintenance Entities,and these are in the most part enough to get the job done from a multiversal perspective,they can also be created by some of the Curators. ME:Do the Curators have to be of a certain level,function,or authority to be able to create or manifest a General Maintenance Entity? SE1:Yes,it is only the highest level of Curator that can invoke the creation of a General Maintenance Entity.Additionally,it is also only the highest level of Curator that can uncreate or dissolve a General Maintenance Entity as well.

ME:When would a General Maintenance Entity be created?What are the criteria for such a function?When would a General Maintenance Entity be uncreated?What are the criteria for such a function? SE1:In both cases there needs to be an overwhelming need for additional General Maintenance Entities to either exist or to no longer exist.This is because there is an optimal number required to assist in the functionality of the multiverse.More are required in times of intense activity.The dissolution of the additional General Maintenance Entities is required in times of normal activity.They are an expendable commodity or resource. ME:Why don't the Curators just leave them in existence?What is the need to dissolve them? SE1:As I just said,there is an optimal number and this number needs to be maintained in the main.There is an optimal number of all Curators required to manage and maintain the structure and evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse.Leaving the additional General Maintenance Entities in existence upsets this balance. ME:What do you mean,balance? SE1:As I just stated,there is an optimal number of Curators required to maintain the multiverse and that this is in balance.The balance,though,is not a function of Curator genre versus Curator genre,it is more a function of the number of Curators,those entities in service,versus the number of entities within the multiversal environment that are in the evolutionary cycle.This balance has to be maintained,but there can be a number of instances when this is to be the case as long as it is only a temporary state. ME:Why is it important to have a balance between those entities that are in service versus those that are in the evolutionary cycle? SE1:There needs to be a ratio of twelve to the power of twelve more entities engaged in being of service to the maintenance of the multiverse than those in the evolutionary cycle. ME:That's an interesting figure. SE1:Yes,it's based upon the major function of structural expansion from one structural level of The Origin to another.It is also a function of my structural expansion,and,before you ask,it doesn't include the step-down from full dimension to subdimension,which would be based upon twelve to the power of three from a spatial perspective. ME:Why is the ratio of maintenance entities in service to the multiverse to those that are in the evolutionary cycle based upon a function of the structure of The Origin/you? SE1:You may well ask. ME:I do and I am! SE1:Well,it's to do with the amount of change,or corrections to the individual,local, universal,and multiversal environment that is made by all those entities that are in the evolutionary cycle,through their ability to make either individual and/or collective,in all of its variants,decisions.As you can appreciate,there is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done when you consider the environmental fractals that are created and therefore need to be maintained as a result of the vagaries of entities within the evolutionary cycle and the subsequent creation of Event Spaces and new or diversified Event Streams,not to mention the maintenance of the mainstream environment/s.As a result there needs to be an optimal balance or ratio between those entities that create new environmental conditions and those that fix or maintain them.As you may have guessed from our recent dialogue,this ratio,although seemingly massive,is sometimes not enough,hence the transient creation of the General Maintenance Entities. I was somewhat surprised at the size of this ratio.It was unimaginably large.However,when I sat back in my chair and thought about it for a moment,it made sense.We,as entities either incarnate or in the energetic,can make a real mess of things,and that mess needs to be maintained or corrected.The fact that there were so,so many other entities clearing up after us was enlightening to say the least.I took stock of this for a moment and thought about how we as entities that are in both the evolutionary cycle and incarnate could help the Curators and came to the conclusion that the only way was to be efficient in our interaction with our environment and those other entities that are also interacting with us and the environment. How can we increase our efficiency?I hear you ask.All I can say is that the best way to be effective and efficient is to give up on being selfish,think of others,and work for the benefit of others (in doing so this benefits the self),reducing one's karmic debt,and see beyond what we all do.Knowing that an experience is a lesson to be learned or an experience to be experienced, helping others to experience what is necessary with love in our hearts and an aim to help them/ us to experience it once,and not a multiple of times.It's the simplest and hardest thing to do, but if we can work in this way,we will reduce the number of environmental and karmic fractals, removing our attractions and addictions to the lower frequencies and the need to incarnate.In the process,we will reduce the amount of remedial work the Curators will need to do.We may also accelerate our evolutionary progression and the progression of this particular evolutionary cycle.We have unlimited possibilities,I thought.All we need to do is work with this idea, and as a result we will spare ourselves so much pain and suffering.Surely this is a temptation beyond thought,a decision that has no alternative?Why most of us miss it is beyond me.I dwelled on these words for a moment,absorbing the energy associated with them.We have free will to choose to make these decisions/actions.We have the capacity to choose the long road or the short road.It is ignorance,ignorance borne through lack of true education that makes us take the long road!I sighed. SE1:It's time to move on to the next genre of Curator. ME:OK,let's go.

## The Beginners 

I have a confession to make.At times Ifind myself in other areas of the world either as a result of my work or due to sabbatical.I am now on sabbatical(Christmas 2016)and with Celia on a day cruise from Mandalay in Myanmar (Burma)to Bagan down the Irrawaddy River.The last three thousand words have been written either en route or on location in Myanmar.The scenery is amazing,as is the history,people,supporting religion(Buddhism),and architecture. As with the trip to Peru I made earlier in the year,I have made some notes(mental and written) to use some of this experience in one of my future works,one that links religions and my work together,where there is commonality.Myanmar is,at least in my mind,another version of India.The cities are full of randomness,hustle and bustle,and the country is untouched, serene,and full of pure Earth energy.I was soaking in the pure energies associated with the Myanmar countryside.It was beautiful and pure and the aura of the trees and bushes along the riverbank glowed in golden white energy.It was calming,so much so that when The Source cut in to remind me that I needed to work for a little longer,it made me jump. SE1:Shall we continue? ME:Yes,sorry.I was just admiring the view. SE1:So I see.Let's get the introduction to this chapter finished and then you can have a rest and continue to enjoy the scenery. ME:Will you summarize?

SE1:Yes.I will elaborate a little on the original summary.The Beginners are not to be confused with the human understanding of a beginning or start.They are a group of beings that work with the functions of Event Space allowing any changes to have its own "start of event,"even when there appears to be no real start.Everything exists in terms of events and not in terms of time;a start or beginning is therefore not a temporal position, it is simply a function of a change of experiential direction.It is the job of the Beginners to ensure that the quality of the start of the event is maintained at its optimal level when introduced into the overall scheme of existing Event Space spaces,or an Event Stream. Note that their insertion of change creates a whole new set of possibilities and as such,the number of new Event Spaces and Event Streams.The fractals and the effects on the beings within these spaces need to be known and managed by these entities. Now at this point,I started to get both a little concerned and interested at the same time. We all know,I hope,that everything happens concurrently,at the same time in human speak, so based upon this,there is no start or end of anything.This is simply because everything that has happened,will happen,is happening,including all of the permutations of possibility, inevitability,etc.,is happening concurrently.Time-based understanding is a human (only) concept,so to say that Event Space has a start of event,and therefore an end of event (see the Enders below)is going against the grain a little,if not a lot!I decided to ask a question about this before continuing with the rest of the dialogue.I wanted to see if these words were just for human consumption or whether or not there really was a beginning,and ultimately an end,of an Event Space or Event Stream.Before I continued,though,I stopped dead in my own tracks.Why had I not considered this before?I mean,we had discussed Event Space and Event Streams before,both in this dialogue and in the dialogues that preceded this book.Why hadI not questioned a beginning and an end of an Event Space or an Event Stream? SE1:Because it wasn't the right time to discuss and question it.You need to have a basic understanding of the concepts surrounding an issue before you are in the true position of being able to critique the information and ask questions that will ultimately extend the boundaries of your understanding,which of course includes incarnate mankind.When we work with new concepts,you are in the mode of total acceptance and total trust.It is only a considerable time,so to speak,after the event that you are able to sit back and think about what has been said.This does not mean that everything that we,you,me, The Origin,and the other Source Entities have discussed is wrong,it is humanized a little to help your understanding.That being said,you will need to understand exactly what the beginning or end of an event is before we can continue with describing what the Beginners and even the Enders do.I will reserve what the end of an Event Space or Event Stream is when we discuss the role of the Enders. ME:OK,that sounds like a plan to me and I think I will kick off the questions right now with a very basic one.What exactly is the start or beginning of an Event and how does that create a new Event Space and Event Stream? SE1:You are not one for waiting,are you? ME:Er,no!I do like to ask nested questions. SE1:So I see.I will answer them in the order that the nest was created then.

ME:Please do. I was smiling here.I knew that The Source was playing with me a little and that it was doing its best to relax me,that being when I am relaxed,I am a better channel and better able to work with the concepts and information that The Source was going to send to me.It was also designed to make me less suspicious and more accepting.A difficult thing to achieve when one has spent most of his life as an engineer.I decided to let The Source carry on in the way it felt best. SE1:Not a bad bit of self-discussion,I think.I approve. ME:Thank you. SE1:The Beginning or start of an Event can be created in one or two ways. The first way is when a group or collective of entities actively work together to change the expected direction of a series of natural events that are identified as a main Event Stream. In this instance when the action/s of the collective that are supported by desire,intention, and thought create enough initial inertia surrounding the potential for change that it initiates the change,then that point is considered to be the beginning or start of the new Event Space.This new Event Space can be any size.In fact,the creation of a new Event Space is not dictated by the size of the Event Space and spaces within the Event Space at all because the space and the event associated with the Event Space expands and contracts as necessary within its own space.This creation of a new Event Space,as a result of collective desire,is usually one of a number of possibilities or probabilities that are aligned to the current Event Space and Event Stream. The second way is when a single entity,again through its desires,intentions,thoughts, and actions,does something that other entities are either attracted to or are influenced by. In this instance,the actions of the entity,on its own,may not be enough to invoke a new global Event Space and can only be capable of creating a local Event Space,which would be normal.However,in the event that the actions of the entity are enough to make other entities change their own ideas,desires,intentions,thoughts,behaviors,and actions, then it can be as effective a change as the invocation of a new Event Space via collective desire.This can be classified as a so-called wild card,a fashion-or fanatic-based following because the global creation of a new Event Space would not be possible without that one entity making the choice it decided to make. ME:Can you give me an example of how a single entity can affect the lives of others to the point where a new Event Space is created? SE1:You have lots of examples on Earth;just think of a person who you call a household name.One where people think,behave,and act as a function of the influence of that person,one where the thoughts,behaviors,and actions of those influenced extend beyond the confines of location and time. ME:OK.Got it.I can think of quite a few people that would come under the banner of "major influence"to the general population.Some of them are what we would call a negative influence in terms of creating a low-frequency way of thinking,behaving,and acting.There are only a few that would be classified as a major "world"influence. SE1:Agreed.But there are a lot of people who can be classified as a minor influence.These people are able to interact with like-minded people and change the way that they think by introducing a new idea or concept in a localized way.Local can be classified as being limited to those of same mind and thought in the wider environment of a single country or city to just those individuals who interact with the person of influence on a personal basis. ME:So,based upon this we have an accumulation of worldwide,wider local,and localized local areas of influence that can create a new or the beginning of an Event Space and new Event Stream.These would result in bubbles,for want of a better word,of Event Space within bubbles of Event Space together with the corresponding Event Streams. SE1:Correct. ME:I am thinking here,though,that all of this should be an automatic function of Event Space and its Event Streams and not a function that requires a Curator,a Beginner,to work with it.Just exactly what do they do? SE1:The Beginners have the ability to manipulate Event Space. ME:Go on.

SE1:Generally,the creation of Event Space and its Event Streams are,as you say,an automatic function of Event Space as an autonomous intelligent environment within The Origin.However,within my energies,those that are reserved for the environment called the multiverse,the Beginners have the ability to fine-tune functions of Event Space to the point where they can introduce a new Event Space exactly at the point where they feel a new series of events has the potential to start from.In this way,they separate out the Events that make up a known and already established Event Space and its Event Streams to create a new Event Space that has a known start point.Or for want of a better word, they create the beginning or start point for these events to progress from. ME:I am struggling to see how this works.Can you elaborate a little for me? SE1:Think of it as having the ability and authority to influence a number of beings and their environment,through making a series of minor or mini changes to the events within the overall Event Space they are associated with that results in the need for a new Event Space,this Event Space having a known and calculable start point;a start point that could only have happened through external intervention-that being,the normal interactions within the Event Stream would not have resulted in a new Event Space and Event Stream on their own. ME:Can you give me an example of one such start of Event Space and Event Stream? SE1:Of course.There is one that happened on Earth not so long ago. ME:Really?When was this?

SE1:The Beginners worked with the Enders [see next section-GSN]to create the beginning or start of a new Event Space that resulted in the fall of the civilization you refer to as Atlantis. The previous Event Space was not going in the right direction from an evolutionary perspective and so a new one needed to be introduced. ME:You're about to tell me that the introduction of the Egyptian civilization was the result of the introduction of a new Event Space by the Beginners,aren't you? SE1:You beat me to it,yes.If you look at Egyptian history,you will see that their civilization just appeared,it suddenly came into existence. ME:Yes,I think we have discussed this before,in a previous dialogue. SE1:Yes,we have,but we have not discussed the reason surrounding this "spontaneous" introduction of a new civilization in any real detail. ME:You're right,we haven't.I simply thought that it was the result of the fall of Atlantis and the desire of those higher frequency incarnates who foresaw the fall of Atlantis and worked hard to reintroduce an incarnate civilization with enough technology and ability to give them a head start.To look at it in a different way,it would be a debt being repaid in lieu of allowing the failure of Atlantis to actually happen. SE1:Well,you can look at it in that way if you wish,but the introduction of the Egyptian civilization was the beginning of a new local Event Space and the Event Streams associated with it.In this way,the Beginners ensured that the quality of the start of the event was maintained at its optimal level when introduced into the overall scheme of the existing wider Event Space and Event Stream.They have been managing the new set of possibilities and the number of new Event Spaces and Event Streams,their fractal Event Spaces,and the effects on the beings within these spaces ever since. ME:Is the beginning or start of a new Event Space normally so obvious from the point of view of the,let's say,detached observer? SE1:No,not always,because the beginning or start of a new Event Space may be an Event Space within an Event Space. ME:Give me another example to work with. SE1:From Earth's perspective that would be the sudden discovery of a new science or technology or process [a manufacturing process to create a new material-GSN].One that would be impossible to discover normally,but that just appears in the mind of an individual.In this instance,the overall Event Space is not affected,but a new Event Space and Event Stream is created within it,the creation of the Event Space having a known start point. ME:OK,I understand now.Most of the work of the Beginners is therefore based upon the influence of key incarnates then. SE1:From the perspective of the physical universe,that would account for some of the work that they do,maybe 40 percent of it.But,for the most part,the work they do is based upon working with the wider environment before it is affected by those entities or beings that occupy it. ME:Are you suggesting that they prepare the wider environment for a change in Event Space and Event Stream? SE1:Yes.You see,when a new Event Space is created by the natural function of Event Space through the interaction of the decisions and the variations on the possibilities that they could go in,a whole new parallel environment is created,complete with the entities acting out their roles within that environment.It happens instantaneously.The function of the Beginners is also to smoothen the flow of the dominant Event Stream to allow a gradual transition from the main Event Space and Event Stream to the new one. ME:Why would the main Event Stream flow need to be smoothed? SE1:So far,all you have discussed with me is the total creation of a new Event Space and Event Stream including the duplication of the entities within that space and stream created as a natural function of Event Space responding to the energies surrounding the point of decision,and/or the variations of possibilities,certainties,and probabilities,etc., etc.,etc.,that create that decision point.We have not discussed the creation of an Event Space and Event Stream where there is a migration of entities from one Event Space and Event Stream to another more appropriate version.It is the creation of this type of Event Space that the Beginners are mostly responsible for and as such,the flow needs to be managed or smoothed as a result. ME:How does that work,I mean,how can entities migrate from one Event Space and Event Stream to another without duplication,triplication,quadruplication,etc.?Surely they would be missed by those who stay and that they used to interact with in the preceding Event Space and Event Stream. SE1:In the example of migration from one Event Space and Event Stream to another,the Beginners work on creating the environment and the introduction point of the new Event Space.They also identify those entities that will occupy it from a migration perspective and from a duplication or parallelization perspective. ME:So this new Event Space and Event Stream is not just populated with migrated entities,it is also populated with duplicated entities. SE1:Correct.It is a Parallel Space that is populated with parallel and nonparallel occupants. In planning the creation of a new Event Space,its Event Stream,and its environment/s, the Beginners look at the whole picture.They look for: the need for a new Event Space and Event Stream in variance to the natural creation of an Event Space and Event Stream by Event Space itself;

what is the introduction point of the new Event Space and Event Stream in comparison with the dominant Event Space and Event Stream; will the Event Space and Event Stream be within the dominant Event Space and Event Stream or will it be external to it; which entity's decision would result in them being parallelized and which result in them being singular; the method of translating singular entities into the new Event Space and Event Stream; the introduction points of the singularized entities from the global(universe wide)perspective; the introduction points of the singularized entities from the individual perspective; the result of removing singularized entities from the preceding Event Space and Event Stream from the perspective of downstream events,entity interactions,and evolutionary progression; These Spaces can be both a fully functioning independent Event Space and Event Stream or an Event Space and Event Stream within a dominant Event Space and Event Stream.

ME:You talked briefly about transplanting entities from one Event Space and Event Stream to another and I asked if the entities in the preceding Event Space and Event Stream would miss them,that they would notice that they are no longer interacting with them.Doesn't this cause a problem? SE1:No.From the perspective of the transplanted entity and those that interact with it, three things occur. First,those entities that remain in the preceding Event Space and Event Stream experience,what seems to them,as a natural end of interaction or relationship.In essence,their incarnate memory is altered to suggest that the entity that has been transplanted simply moved outside of the remaining entities'sphere of existence and is no longer available to interact with them.An example you can use would be that the remaining entity would think that the transplanted entity has migrated to another country or to a distance that negates the possibility of continued interaction.They may even be given the memory that that entity has finished its incarnation.As a result,the transplanted entity is no longer in their minds. Second,from the perspective of the transplanted entity,it sees no change other than the decision it made or the state of existence it is experiencing has no alternative.That being a parallel version of it and its environment could not be created as a result in the change in its direction,environment,or interaction. Third,from the perspective of the parallelized entities,nothing has changed.Everything is normal.All interactions,environments,and experiences are as they were,as they are, and as they will be.It is a parallel existence in every way in comparison to the preceding Event Space and Event Stream. In the new Event Space and Event Stream,the parallelized entities are,for want of a better word,the background props for the environment and interaction with the transplanted entities.This allows the transplanted entities to experience,learn,and evolve in the nonparallelized direction they were going in.The parallelization of these entities is therefore purely for the benefit of the transplanted entities. ME:What creates the need for an entity to be transplanted in the first place? SE1:A dead certainty based upon an inevitability that a decision made by that entity would result in one Event Space and Event Stream and not another. ME:But couldn't another decision point occur further down the Event Stream that would result in the invocation of a new Event Space and Event Stream? SE1:This type of Event Space and Event Stream is created specifically for those entities that have a stream of dead certainties and inevitabilities and as such remains stable. ME:Couldn't the parallelized entities within that Event Space create them,though? SE1:Yes,but they would not affect those entities that were transplanted.In that instance,although the transplanted entities would be parallelized,they would become the background props for those entities that are creating the new Event Space and Event Stream.They would simply be part of the scenery and not have any valid interactions that would create a new Event Space and Event Stream.Their ability to interact with the environment and its occupants and make valid interactions would remain in the Event Space and Event Stream that was initially created for them. I sat down and wondered for a moment.The creation of an Event Space and an Event Stream is not a simple thing to consider,especially the point within an existing Event Space and Event Stream that a new Event Space and Event Stream is inserted,creating the "start"of Event and Stream.Even the creation of a new autonomous Event Space and Event Stream external to an existing Event Space and Event Stream is difficult because the number of possibilities of decisions that could,should,or might create the automatically created Event Space and Event Stream may negate the need for the Beginners to intervene. I was about to contact The Source and start the dialogue on the genre of Curator entities called the Enders when I started to think about the words "start"and "end"-again.Forgive me,dear reader,for going over this very old ground again (and again!),but everything I/we have been told to date is that there is no such thing as a start and an end,that everything is concurrently operating in the same space and that time was a construct made by those entities that incarnate as human beings.Based upon this,to have no time,to have concurrence,and also have a start and end point to describe the manifestation and dissolution of an Event Space and an Event Stream seemed ludicrous,to say the least.I decided to put this to bed (bring it to a close)once and for all with The Source before moving on to the Enders. SE1:Why bother with such questions when you already know the answer?

ME:I know you have told me in the past but it's just that it seems such a dichotomy. SE1:Everything in the low frequencies of the physical universe is a dichotomy.That is why entities incarnate into it,to experience dichotomies,dualities,and linearity.It's just that it's difficult to see why it is. I will start again with the same description that Byron gave you all those years ago.Event Space is like a rubber-band ball,with each event being represented by a single rubber band.Each rubber band is in contact with each other either by direct contact to a rubber band or indirect contact to a rubber band via another rubber band.Event Space therefore being a collection of events that occupy the same space,the Event Stream is the function of the events within the Event Space connecting together in a logical way,one that allows continuity of the overall Event Space in its space while allowing the events within the Event Space to be individualized.So,using the rubber-band ball as the illustration,the Event Stream is the connecting link between the various events that are logically placed together in a way where one event leads to another.In this way,the events that are linked together by the Event Stream don't need to be located side by side.In essence,event number one can be directly linked to event number forty-two even when there are forty other events in between them.This is only possible because they are all occupying the same Event Space.It is the function of the Event Stream that allows the beginning or start of an event to be connected to the end of an event irrespective of its location within the Event Space and irrespective of its state of parallelization simply because it is in the same space.Similarly,the events being all within the same Event Space is the reason why it is possible to traverse the events,to go forward or backward in time in human speak.Except that,you don't go forward and back in time,you go from one event to another,which may or may not be before or after each other. The beginning/start or end of an event is an automatic change in experiential and evolutionary direction brought about either by the choices made by the entities within the events "within"the Event Space or by the Beginners or Enders if there is a need for a new Event Space that can only be invoked by external intervention.So,try to think in terms of changes in experiential and evolutionary direction rather than in the beginning or end of an experience or evolutionary opportunity,even though the entities described and about to be described are called Beginners and Enders. Another way to think about it is in the way a tree branch terminates by being split out in a fractal way.The point at which the new branches are created can be considered as both the end of the previous Event Space and the beginning of the new Event Space/ s.Note,though,that this assumes that there is a preceding Event Space from which to create a new Event Space.I will talk about this in a minute.However,if the branch of the tree remains to be the dominant branch after a new branch has been created,then this is considered to be the main Event Space and the small branch a minor Event Space,or an Event Space within an Event Space. I waited with baited breath for The Source to talk about the creation of an Event Space with no preceding Event Space to be created from.Why?Because this is a real start point!

SE1:I thought you might like this part. ME:You bet.For me this is the whole point and one where we cross over to the point of the immaculate creation of The Origin. SE1:That's not a strictly true statement because Event Space itself allowed the creation of The Origin to take priority over its own sentience.So,there was intervention even if it was by Event Space itself.Suffice to say,the creation of an Event Space that has no preceding Event Space and Event Stream to work from is the ultimate responsibility of the Beginners. ME:How can that be?I mean,there must be a series of events that preceded the point at which the Beginners decide to create a new Event Space,one that does not have a preceding space,to enable them to come to the conclusion that there is a need for a new Event Space. SE1:Correct.However,the preceding Event Space is the Event Space that the Beginners exist within and not an Event Space that they are working with or maintaining. ME:Ah!So in this case then,they can create a new and totally independent Event Space with no preceding Event Space specifically because they are outside of the Event Space that they are working with or are maintaining.They are creating it to create a new and unique environment for your entities to work with. SE1:Now you have it.

ME:It feels a bit like discovering a new land and venturing forth to populate it. SE1:That's one way of describing it,yes.Now we need to move on to the Enders.

## The Enders 

With the level of discussion that we had in the preceding chapter on the Beginners,it almost felt unnecessary to work on describing the roles and responsibilities of the Enders.I felt that we had discussed them,that they would be the reciprocal of the Beginners.I was just thinking about what the additional text and discussion may offer when The Source jumped in with the short description again and put my mind at rest with the start of new and additional information. SE1:Moving on then.The Enders are the group of beings that work with the functions of Event Space allowing any change in event to be maintained at its optimal level when withdrawn from the overall scheme of existing Event Space spaces recognizing that the withdrawal of an Event Space and its Event Streams creates a whole new set of possibilities.Also,the lack of creation of the number of potential new Event Spaces,their fractals,and the effects on the beings from an experiential and evolutionary perspective within these spaces needs to be known and managed by these entities. In variance to the "forced"function of the Beginners,the end of event can be created either as a naturalized or forced function. ME:I thought we stated with the Beginners that the beginning or start of a new Event Space can be created as a naturalized function? SE1:No.Although there can be natural creations of Event Space and Event Streams,the Beginners don't actually invoke a naturalized beginning or start,they only create a new Event Space by force.Force means that they decide to use whatever abilities they have to invoke the creation of a new Event Space based upon a desire or need to do so and if the new Event Space or Event Stream would not be created as a natural function of Event Space. ME:Looking at this then,the Enders have an easier job to do because all they are doing is forcing or creating a natural termination of an Event Space. SE1:It sounds simple,doesn't it? ME:I wouldn't have said it if I didn't think it was. SE1:Not true,though.You see,the Enders have to consider all of the downstream functions of the Event Space and Event Stream.What this means is that they have to look at the effects of removing the Parallelized Event Spaces and Event Streams from the overall productivity of the Event Space that they are electing to terminate. ME:What criteria are required to allow the Enders to make the decision that an Event Space should be finalized or ended before it reaches its natural and automatic end? SE1:There are many criteria.It's not just about stopping a sequence of events,an Event Space,and its Event Stream dead in its tracks.It's about looking at the evolutionary efficiency of an Event Space and in some cases,the streamlining of the number of Event Spaces that are in action. ME:Can you advise me of the differences in criteria for the dissolution of an Event Space and whether or not it is a natural dissolution or a forced dissolution?

SE1:Yes,of course. There are four main criteria or stages that need to be considered before an Event Space and its Event Stream can be dissolved.Please note that an evolutionary dead end is also an Event Space: 1.What is the duplication of experience and evolution when referring to other Event Spaces?Is the duplication so high that there is little to be gained by the continuation of this Event Space,or,is there enough of a difference to allow its continued existence? 2.How many evolutionary dead ends are being created by this Event Space? Do any of the dead ends actually result in a level of learning and therefore an element of limited evolution?If any evolutionary dead end results in a unique learning experience then it needs to stay in existence. 3.Is the Event Space capable of creating other Event Spaces?There are Event Spaces that don't create any fractals of themselves due to the nature of the functions of the entities working within them.If there is unique experience and learning then the Event Space remains in existence.If,however,the Event Space shows no experiential or evolutionary growth,and the experience of the entities is therefore static and mundane,then the Event Space is dissolved.

4.Is the Event Space capable of arriving at a naturally occurring end in its own right,or will it need to be forced into dissolution?The normal and automatic function of an Event Space is such that it naturally dissolves when it reaches an evolutionary dead end.However,as with the third example,this is not always the case and an Event Space can at times continue to exist in a static and stagnant state.An Event Space that remains in a static and stagnant state is of no benefit to the entities within it,whether it is parallelized,and the entities within are parallelized,or not.Such an Event Space can also stop the natural dissolution of other Event Spaces if it ends up becoming the dominant or mainstream Event Space and so must be dissolved. ME:All of this is based upon the need to dissolve an Event Space and the criteria to support such a decision.What about the natural dissolution of an Event Space?I mean,what do the Enders work on to support the natural functions of Event Space in this instance? SE1:All of what we have just discussed revolves around the need to change the natural functions of Event Space and not leave things as they are.The need to change a natural function is the whole reason for the need of the Curator genre of entities to optimize the natural function of the multiversal environment and its interactions with its incumbent entities and the space it exists within and without.Speeding nature up is an overarching function of the Curators and the Enders are key to this.In general,the functions surrounding the need to dissolve an Event Space are the majority of the content of the Enders'responsibilities.Knowing when to leave an Event Space to its own functions is another skill set they have. ME:In general,then,can it be assumed that the Enders are like gardeners,pruning the dead or dying Event Space fractals away from the healthy or dominant Event Spaces, allowing the optimal performance of Event Spaces within the locations they are created to continue.This is achieved either by doing nothing because the natural dissolution of the Event Space is in itself the most efficient,or by assisting in its dissolution. SE1:That is a reasonable synopsis.However,we have one more area that the Enders work within to discuss. ME:What is that? SE1:One that we have alluded to twice now but not actually discussed. ME:And that is? SE1:Recognizing that the withdrawal of an Event Space and its Event Streams within the overall Event Space creates a whole new set of possibilities.And,moreover,that an event within an Event Space can be removed while maintaining the space it exists within. ME:I thought that we had discussed the first part of that statement? SE1:No.Read the text again. I did,and I understood what The Source was alluding to.

ME:Ah!I understand now.We have been discussing the dissolution of an Event Space,not the withdrawal of one.This is all about the withdrawal of an Event Space.Withdrawal is not dissolution;it is relocation. SE1:Yes,and the movement of an event from one active Event Space to another. ME:So we have two things to discuss,the maintenance of an event when removed from an Event Space,and the movement of an event from one Event Space to another. SE1:Correct. The Maintenance of an Event SE1:The Enders have the capability of terminating the downstream effects of a certain event by removing it from the overarching Event Space that it is expressed within.The removal of an event can be created by the manipulation of the preceding events so that the event that needs to be removed is,in effect,terminated.Or,for want of a better word, never actually comes into existence.As a result of this,the downstream events that would have been created are no longer created and those events that were already in existence, that would have been affected by the event itself or its fractals,are no longer due to be affected. ME:This is the same as we have just discussed,though,isn't it?

SE1:Yes,of course.The clever bit here,though,is that the Enders have the capacity to realize the individualized opportunity for evolution that maintaining a particular event in isolation to others will have,if it is indeed isolated and allowed to play out its natural functions within this isolated state. ME:So it is no longer affected by any external influences? SE1:No,it is maintained in its pure state.To enable the isolation and removal of an event to be successful,the Enders need to intercept the event at its conception,that point when it is a new event and has not been in existence long enough to affect other events within its Event Space and Event Stream. ME:I was about to ask how they know when the conception of an event is to take place but being the beings that they are,with the abilities that they have,sort of explains it. SE1:Yes,it does.As with the Beginners,the Enders exist outside of the structure of the multiverse I created within me and so they are capable of seeing the functions in a concurrent way. ME:How does that work?I am just thinking aloud (or in type!)about Event Space being a much bigger function,one that includes you and is a fundamental component of The Origin.If Event Space is a much bigger function,how do the Beginners and Enders have the abilities to work with Event Space in the way they do? SE1:They work within the overall Event Space,and its fractals,that I am working within, all of course within the overall structure of The Origin.It is because they are working outside of the overarching Event Space that contains the multiverse and its localized Event Spaces,while being within mine,that they can see the routes that entities make that result in the creation of a new event and remove it from the Event Space it was destined to manifest within before the point of manifestation. ME:So it never manifests in the first place? SE1:Yes,it does,but it is just removed and placed in isolation.Although those entities that would have been the key creators of the conditions that created the event are unaffected and continue to the next event without disturbance,if the event is isolated,they are parallelized to allow the event to play out in its isolated space. ME:What is an isolated space? SE1:It is an area of benign Event Space that is created by the Enders to allow the event that is removed to exist within,work its way through,and come to a natural end. ME:An Event Space that goes nowhere. SE1:Yes.It's a tract of Event Space that is not connected to any other possible creation of Event Space other than itself,and so is isolated. ME:How is it possible?I mean Event Space is an autonomous function of The Origin,it creates parallel versions of itself as a result of us making decisions,and they expand and contract on a fractal basis.I am not aware of an Event Space that is autonomous from Event Space itself? SE1:That's right,you aren't.It doesn't exist as a natural function of Event Space;it is created by the Enders. ME:I am sorry that I didn't ask this question before,but just how do the Enders create a tract of Event Space that is autonomous from the overall and overarching Event Space? SE1:As entities,you are all created from my energies and my structure and I in turn am created from the energies of The Origin;you already know this. ME:Yes,I do. SE1:Within all of these energies there is of course an aspect of sentience or intelligence associated with these energies.Do you recognize this? ME:Yes,I do. SE1:Then also recognize that it is possible to assign aspects of energy and its associated sentience or intelligence to other aspects of energy and sentience or intelligence. ME:Got it赳SE1:Not yet,you haven't.

ME:OK. SE1:You will soon,though,because I haven't finished yet.Considering that you and all other entities that are either created by The Origin or myself can also be classified as energy and its associated sentience,or sentience given a body of energy,it can then be noted that an aspect of the energy and intelligence associated with Event Space can be assigned to the energy of another entity. ME:That would make an entity part you and part Event Space and not just an individualized unit of you. SE1:Correct. ME:And this means that such an entity could command and manipulate those energies that are within it,that are part of it. SE1:Yes,and it also means that such an entity could attract more of those energies to it and manipulate those as well. ME:And this is what the Enders are made of? SE1:Yes,it is. ME:The Enders are therefore part you,part Curator of the Ender genre,and part Event Space. SE1:Yes,they are.

ME:And so are the Beginners? SE1:Correct again.Now you are getting it. ME:Nearly there,then.Therefore,because the energies that are used to create the Enders (and the Beginners)also have a percentage of Event Space within them,they are able to collect,command,and control energies associated with Event Space and create a new tract of Event Space. SE1:Yes,and what's more,because the Enders have been blessed with individuality,they also have the ability to pass on the essence of individuality to the energies they work with, including Event Space. ME:And this essence of individuality is what is required to allow the creation of an autonomous and self-contained tract of Event Space,one that never creates fractals or parallel versions of it. SE1:Correct. ME:And you created the Enders(and Beginners)with this ability by adding in the energies associated with Event Space? SE1:Of course.The Beginners and Enders are not the only Curators that have this ability, the Architects do as well [not previously discussed-GSN],but they tend not to use this ability because the Beginners and Enders have the roles that demand the use of such a function,the Architects do not as such.

ME:I am thinking about this for a moment-an Event Space that is autonomous and self- contained with no external influences to relate to as part of a parallelization or a fractal of a parallelization and no internal decision that can make it parallelize itself.This is almost like the environment that immersed incarnate mankind thinks it exists within.Hold on; is this what we are actually working within,an isolated and individualized tract of Event Space? SE1:No,it's not what incarnate mankind exists within.Although I sometimes think it would be a good idea.No,there are too many parallel evolutionary opportunities created by you all to make me want,via the Enders,to withdraw the space that you all occupy and isolate it.There have been instances,though,when the Enders have moved an Event Space fractal created by immersed incarnate mankind into another Event Space. Movement of Events from One Event Space to Another My head was buzzing now.Some part of what we have all collectively created as a parallel function due to some form of what I can only guess is a collective decision process,has resulted in the Enders moving that Event Space into another.I sat back a moment and wondered when that was and why it happened.I was about to wait and discuss this with The Source at the end of this discussion when The Source decided that it needed to be answered first. SE1:There are two times that are of note.One recently and one in what you would call prehistory.The first mankind-derived Event Space that was moved to another overall Event Space was based in the time when the use of the human form allowed Aspects of TES to move from one incarnate vehicle to another on a regular basis,leaving some part of their energetic signature behind in the human form resulting in a disharmonic effect with the Aspects themselves as they absorbed the energetic signature of the previous users of the human form they had just moved into,effectively losing their own and therefore dominant energetic signature over time [see The History of God-GSN].In the version of Event Space you are currently working within,the function of incarnation was changed to stop this from happening.This was achieved by stopping the ability of the incarnate Aspects from moving from one human form to another and reducing the ability of the incarnate Aspect to remember such functions while incarnate.In the Event Space that was removed,this function was allowed to continue to see what would happen. Recognizing that it would ultimately cause a loss of initial individuality,this Event Space was duplicated with one duplicate being placed in a tract of autonomous Event Space,and another in a fractal of a similar Event Space.In the first instance,the Aspects experienced a return to communion and therefore a complete loss of individuality,but only affecting the Earth as a location.In the second instance,the disharmony spread throughout all incarnate vehicles throughout the physical universe in all locations and all frequencies.It was disastrous,while also being interesting to watch. In these two actions,the Curators noted how they can change the overall results as a function of relocating Event Spaces or effectively terminating its ability to parallelize. The second time when an Event Space was moved to another Event Space was during what you call the Second World War.

ME:The Second World War?But that's recent,really recent.What happened at this time that required the need for the dominant Event Space to be moved?What happened to the entities that were working within that Event Space? SE1:I will answer the last question first. ME:OK. SE1:There was a parallelization of all of those entities and the environments that were in that Event Space,one that would only be a singular parallelization,that being,no other Event Spaces would be created and no entities would be parallelized.This was achieved to allow this particular Event Space to play itself out in an autonomous fashion. ME:And is it still playing itself out today? SE1:Yes,of course.It is still local from your perspective.Those entities that were autonomously parallelized continued to interact with those entities that are also autonomously parallelized within the environment created. ME:So what happened?What caused the need for such a series of events to be removed from the overall overarching Event Space? SE1:The possibility of contamination. ME:I'm sorry?What does that mean?

SE1:The use of what you call atomic weaponry was developed by all of the major players in this version of World War Two simultaneously,and was used simultaneously.This was foreseen by the Enders and as a result,the Event Space that displayed this series of scenarios was removed from the overall and overarching Event Space and allowed to play itself out.The effect was horrific,to say the least.All of the major cities and areas of dense population were destroyed and the incarnate population was deeply affected by the radiation resulting from the use of such weapons. Suffice to say,the TES which had projected Aspects/Shards into that environment agreed to have those Aspects/Shards parallelized and isolated to allow the energetic effects of the experiences to be filtered and for the TES only to experience the resulting effects and not share it,at least not initially,with those other parts of the Aspects/Shards that were parallelized in other Event Spaces.The experience of such vast levels of destruction and the ascension of so many incarnates back into the energetic in one series of events would have been too much for the other parallelized Aspects/Shards to cope with.It was beyond anything that even the demise of the civilization called Atlantis would illustrate. Additionally,the desire to achieve such an act of destruction had spread worldwide,not just to those who instigated it,but throughout the general populous as well.The need to destroy would be felt at the general incarnate population level in the other Event Spaces if it was not filtered by the TES and placed in an isolated,individualized,and autonomous tract of Event Space.It would have spread at this point in incarnate mankind's evolution to all Event Spaces in some level of intensity or another resulting in similar Event Streams being played out and an overall downward spiral down the frequencies.This was the contamination I was alluding to. The entities in that Event Space are now experiencing what you might like to call a devolved state of being where all forms of civilization have all but disappeared.Disease is rife and as a result,the longevity of the incarnate vehicle is limited.Indeed,all but a few of the incarnate vehicles are sterilized by the radiation and as a result cannot reproduce. In this Event Space,the Earth is about to see the dawn of the loss of the human body as an incarnate vehicle. ME:I am glad this Event Space did not experience such a horrendous Event Space and Event Stream.Hang on,though;what you have just described is the removal of one Event Space and the positioning of it into an autonomous Event Space! SE1:Yes,it is.However,this is not the end of the story.Once that Event Space was created, and the Event Space just talked about was relocated,other more local Event Spaces were needed to be positioned into this Event Space to allow a change in direction to one where we have the current Event Space and Event Stream.In order to do this,those events that resulted in an evolutionary dead end in other Event Spaces were inserted into this Event Space to stop the overall creation of events that led to all parties being able to use atomic weapons concurrently.I will explain the process in summary shortly,but suffice to say it was successful. ME:Having one country deliver the devastation and not another was a success then?

SE1:Yes. ME:Why?I would have thought that the optimal result would have been to remove the scenario of the use of atomic weapons from the event altogether? SE1:No.There needed to be one country that was the first user of such technology and not the majority of them.This was necessary because the population of that time,and indeed this time,needed to see what the result would be from a local perspective which would allow them to establish what a worldwide effect would be.One country's use of atomic technology was designed to be an eye-opener,not a threat,one that would allow clear thinking.Those Aspects/Shards that were in Hiroshima agreed on the soul level,so to speak,to sacrifice their incarnations for the ultimate better good. ME:It doesn't sound like a better good,though. SE1:No,not on the human level you are all working on,but it was the only way to stop the alternative events taking place. ME:But we have a nuclear standoff with lots of countries now! SE1:Yes,incarnate mankind does,but it is one that is not likely to create the undesired result.Incarnate mankind will evolve mentally soon to the point where this technology can be put to a much better and more benign use. ME:I look forward to that day with great anticipation.

SE1:You all will,of that I am sure. I said that I was going to explain how one Event Space is moved from one overall Event Space to another because,as you stated,what I have just described is the movement to an autonomous Event Space,and a rather high-level way in which an Event Space can be changed by introducing Events that result in evolutionary dead ends.Once I have done this,we can move on to the next genre of Curator. Moving One Event Space to Another ME:So what about the process of moving one Event Space to another Event Space? SE1:This is a most difficult process and one that requires a lot of planning and pre- analysis work that is above and beyond that required to move an Event Space from its overall or overarching Event Space to an autonomous and isolated Event Space. ME:Why would that be?I mean,it must be just as difficult to see how certain Event Streams are correctly terminated or dissolved without adversely affecting the evolutionary requirements or benefits that would have been experienced by those entities in the downstream events. SE1:The additional work lies in the insertion of the Event Space into its new overall or overarching Event Space.When an Event Space is being transplanted,the work required to remove it is identical to that required when an Event Space is being removed from its overall or overarching Event Space into the autonomous Event Space.However,when an Event Space is being placed into an overall or overarching Event Space that has other Event Spaces that are within and without it,together with their own series of possibilities and possibility of possible possibilities for parallel versions to be created,the insertion of another Event Space and the relation of all of its downstream possibilities and possibility of possible possibilities together with the effects of these possibilities within and without the existing Event Streams and downstream fractals needs to be analyzed.In essence, an Event Space can only be inserted into another Event Space if the existing Event Streams can be left in either an unchanged state or the insertion creates some level of augmentation or evolutionary benefit to the original Event Space and Event Stream. ME:I know that you are describing the effects,and that you continue to do so as it must provide some level of basic understanding,but I am just eager to see the process used in the actual insertion. SE1:OK,I will send you a series of images and you can describe it to your readers. The Source sent me the images and it was interesting,to say the least.It looked like a giant series of lines,each one interlinked,expanding and contracting,duplicating and paralleling and dissolving.It's... SE1:Don't just think it.Say it out loud and type it! ME:Yes,of course.Sorry,dear reader,I was so immersed in the image I forget to record it in the usual way.

As I was just saying,I saw the Event Space initially as a series of related Event Streams. Lines of events or activities that break away into fractals and then dissolve back into one main Event Stream as the events are either completed,terminated,or join another Event Stream.But this was just the events themselves;it was not the Event Space.As I looked from a different perspective,I noticed that all of these lines were within,and without,and by without I mean external to but not dissociated from an amorphous and undulating sphere that was constantly changing its form.To say it was a sphere would be wrong actually;it would be best to describe it in terms of a bubble of soapy water that was pulled or blown through a metal or plastic hoop.As the hoop is pulled faster,the air goes into the hoop and stretches it.The same is achieved if blowing air through the hoop;however,if the hoop is pulled fast through the air and the direction of the hoop is changed,the bubble takes the shape of the direction of the hoop while trying to retain a spherical type of shape. An Event Space that is contained in an autonomous tract of overall Event Space would be spherical in nature but one that has active Event Streams that are in contact with each other,and other Event Spaces have the appearance of being an elongated or stretched soapy water bubble that has merged with another. When an Event Space is removed from its overall Event Space,the bubble has to be disconnected from other bubbles as well as the lines of Event Streams while allowing the bubbles and Event Streams that were in connection with each other,via the removed Event Space and Event Streams.To be connected to each other again in a manner that is not affected by the loss of the Removed Event Space and Event Streams,that being,they are in direct connectivity with each other.Consider it like having three bubbles joined together by the middle bubble or second bubble,and when the middle or second bubble is removed,the first and third bubbles merge together to create one overall bubble but that one bubble is actually two bubbles co-joined together.The same thing can be observed with the lines that represent the Event Streams that reconnect at the points where the Event Streams would have been connected via the second or middle set of Event Streams. In this way,the Event Spaces,their events and Event Streams connect directly and seamlessly together in a way that,to the outside observer,looks like there was no interconnecting Event Space and Event Streams in the first place.Each event becomes the precursor and predecessor of the Event Spaces before and after them in place of that Event Space and Event Stream that was removed. ME:But doesn't this mean that the areas where the Event Spaces and Event Streams connect need to be modified in some way to allow the connections to be consistent with that which should precede the events prior to the connections? SE1:Yes,but this is only required on the preceding events and not the resulting events.I saw for a moment that you thought that events resulting from the connection would need to be modified as well. ME:I admit that I was about to ask that question,but then I looked at it from another angle and realized that as long as the preceding events were modified to suit the expected result of the receiving events then the connection would be in harmony. I have another question,though.How much modification is required and how does that affect the natural functions of the events surrounding the preceding Event Space? SE1:The results of the events and Event Streams within the preceding Event Space naturally lead to the end event that leads into the next or resulting Event Space.It is therefore a simple action that the Enders perform to shortcut to the start of the next or resulting Event Space by creating a series of alternative but nevertheless natural consequences that lead to an event that connects to the first event and Event Stream within the next Event Space.Try to think of it in terms of playing the board game "Snakes and Ladders,"where the dice is thrown and the result is that one player's marker lands on the bottom of a ladder that terminates on the very last square,shortcutting most of the squares on the board.The end result is the same in terms of the marker needing to land on the last square to finish the game,it's just that the player didn't need to place the marker on the squares in between the square where the start of the ladder was and the square that ends the game.It's just that the content of the Events and the Event Streams have not been experienced. ME:Doesn't this mean that the preceding event,the last square of the Snakes and Ladders board,is lacking in experiential and evolutionary content,content that it would have accrued had it been experienced? SE1:Yes,it does,and it ultimately needs to be recovered at some point in a downstream event,but in essence this is classified as a desirable position to be in rather than be in the position where the events would be,had the Event Space and its Event Streams not been removed.

ME:Are the entities within the resulting Event Space and Event Stream aware that the original preceding Event Space has been removed and that they are in evolutionary debt and lacking in experiential content? SE1:Yes and no.It all depends upon what evolutionary level they are at and whether or not the changes are happening within the lowest frequencies of the multiverse such as the Gross Physical universe,or the energetic such as in the multiverse.Those of you in the Gross Physical aspect of the multiverse,the physical universe at levels 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and 8 would not know if anything had happened to their particular Event Space or Event Streams.Those in levels 9,10,11,and 12 would recognize a change but would not know the detail.Suffice to say,they would feel as if events had speeded up. Interestingly enough,the feeling that time has speeded up is something that you on Earth have and are experiencing.This is a direct result and function of the removal of the Event Space we talked about earlier.I say this is interesting because at your levels of frequency, you should not notice anything.Having said that,though,there is a large number of you that are at a higher than normal evolutionary level incarnate at the moment and that will have an effect on the higher spiritual abilities of you all,especially those who are advanced and leading the spiritual and metaphysical way. ME:OK,we have talked about the process of removing an Event Space and connecting the preceding and resulting(next)Event Spaces and their Event Streams,but what is the process of inserting an unrelated Event Space and Event Streams into an Event Space?

SE1:It's a similar process to that which I have just described.The only difference is that there is work to be done at all points of connection with the preceding and resulting Event Spaces and Event Streams.With the new Event Space being different,there needs to be a modification to the end of the preceding Event Space to introduce events that are in harmony with the resulting or start of the Event Space that is due to be introduced. In this way,the new Event Space,although not in true harmony,would appear to be a logical set of resulting events.The end of the last event of the Event Space that is due to be introduced would also need to be modified to suit the start of event of the resulting or next Event Space so that there is no influencing effect from the Event Space and Event Stream to be introduced.From the perspective of the maintenance of the existing Event Spaces and Event Streams that are considered to be the resulting,next,or downstream events, Event Spaces,and Event Streams,it is imperative that the downstream results are not affected,that the expected and existing event outcomes are unchanged.That is,providing that the desire is to introduce a different Event Space into an existing series of Event Spaces with little or best still,no overall changes to the resulting downstream events. ME:What do you mean? SE1:What I mean is that there may be times when the whole point of moving one Event Space to another may be to change some ultimate undesirable Event Space and event or Event Stream.This also supports the multiversal requirement of changing or manipulation of universes only if it is thoroughly investigated and analyzed first.

In both instances,there is a desire to either maintain the downstream events or change the origin of those events to support the existing Events.Based upon this,you can see that it is important to analyze all inputs and outputs when considering where to introduce the Event Space within the other events preceding the Event Space. ME:In summary then,the events within the Event Spaces that are connected together need to be modified to ensure that there is some form of continuity of Event Stream so that the Event Spaces themselves are logical in terms of the preceding and resulting events.Without the logical progressions,they cannot connect together and would cause an Event Space continuity error of some sort.

SE1:Correct,and it is the role of the Beginners and the Enders to ensure that there are no continuity errors between Event Spaces that have had an intermediate Event Space removed or a new Event Space introduced. ME:Good.I feel like I understand now. SE1:You understand enough for the moment;enough to allow you to access more detailed information. ME:Thank you.

## The Deliverers 

Having finished with the Enders,it was a natural progression to discuss those entities that work with them both.The Deliverers were therefore the next of the Curators on the list of The Source's maintenance entities to discuss.Although I did wonder a little bit about what we could talk about,seeing as though most of what we had discussed must have covered the work that the Deliverers perform for the Beginners and Enders.I sat at my computer thinking that this was going to be a very short chapter,not that there is anything wrong with a short chapter,it's just that one gets used to long chapters at times and the sly old ego gets in the way by wanting the chapters to be long as well.The spiritual side of me knows that things are what they are supposed to be and that this also includes the length of a chapter in a book.I placed all of the wild thoughts surrounding this subject to one side and let myself connect with Source.As usual, it was happy to connect and I felt the flood of warm and loving energy flow over me,removing my concerns and calming me down.The Source summarized the roles of the Deliverers and continued with the in-depth dialogues I was used to. SE1:The Deliverers are those beings who work on the functional side of the work of the Beginners and Enders.Their role is a multidisciplined one that varies in any way that is necessary to allow the associated work of the Beginners and Enders to be implemented. They are not specialized to any particular job,role,or responsibility per se,although they are specialized to working with the functions of the entities they serve. ME:That was an interesting end to the sentence,suggesting that the Deliverers serve the Beginners and Enders. SE1:All entities that are Curators are of service.The statement is of no other significance. That being said,the Deliverers do dedicate themselves to the work of the Beginners and Enders and so they are of specialized service,even though they are multidisciplined and as such are not truly specialized in the sense of being limited to one particular function within a series of possible functions when working in service to another entity. I can see your eyes rolling into the back of your head. ME:You have got me. SE1:I will explain the roles of the Deliverers in an attempt to get your eyes back to the front of your head then. In the scheme of the work that the Beginners and Enders perform,the Deliverers work at the minute detail that is required to implement the work that the Beginners and Enders desire to achieve to make the changes discussed in the previous dialogues. ME:I know that this will be a logical comment but it seems that the roles of the Beginners and Enders is to create the strategy and process behind the work that they do,and the Deliverers do the actual work required to make those strategies and processes come into fruition.

SE1:You have come a long way around to come to that conclusion,but,yes,the Deliverers work on the details surrounding the work that the Beginners and Enders feel is necessary to ensure the Event Spaces and Event Streams are in continuity. ME:As you are speaking,I am receiving an image of some of the work they are doing. They deal with the absolute minute details of the way events interact and interconnect. It's as if they work like embroiderers,but they are not embroidering cloth or twine,they are embroidering what I can only describe as being fiber optic cables.Each of the cables is an Event Stream within an Event Space.They weave them within and without each other,moving them from one logical place to another logical place.Each of the Event Streams represents a series of interconnected and interacting events within the overall or overarching Event Space.There is more,though.It is as though the so-called fiber optics that represent the Event Streams have what I can only call programs traveling through them like dots and dashes in a digital transmission of light.Each of these dots and dashes represent the events themselves within the Event Streams.The dots represent a short event and the dashes represent a long event.As I look closer,though,I see that there is a size to the dots and the dashes as well.The size of the dots represents the impact a specific event makes on the direction of the Event Stream.The size and length of the dashes indicate the duration of the event within the Event Stream as well as its impact or influence within the Event Stream.To put it another way,an event can be short but of high,medium,or low impact and importance and an event can also be of longer or long duration while also being of low,medium,or high impact or importance.The longer the dash,the longer the duration of the event and therefore the greater the duration of its overall influence on the Event Stream.The larger the size or diameter of the dot and/or the body of the dash,the greater the impact on the overall Event Stream. All of this is of course for illustration purposes but the relevance feels unbelievably close to the truth.Ifelt invigorated again. I see something else,though.I see entities moving in and around these dots and dashes.One of the entities moves close to a dot and creates a barrier or a shield around it.The dot changes appearance.Previously it looked,or should I say,appeared to be,a color that was in harmony with the colors of the dots and dashes before and after it.Now it appears to be a neutral color, one that would be acceptable to any area within the Event Stream.The entity looks like it is removing the dot-it is!It moves the dot to another location within the Event Stream and inserts it.The appearance changes to one that is in keeping with the appearance of the,in this instance, dot before the moved event and a dash behind the event.Initially,though,before the color of the inserted event changes to one that is the same as the preceding and resulting event,all three change color to a slightly reddish hue.This change in color is temporary,and within a few seconds,the color stabilizes to the natural color of the total series of dots and dashes in the local area of the insertion. In the area of the removal of the event,a similar process occurs.Before the event is relocated,it is held in stasis and its neutral appearance or color is achieved.The two events that were before and after the removed event,two dashes,join together as interconnected events,or become the logical predecessor and resulting events.As they become the predecessor and resulting events, they too temporarily change appearance to one that is of a light blue color.They also change back to an appearance or color that is in harmony with the local events in the Event Stream. As I looked at this process closer,I noticed that these entities that were working on behalf of the Beginners and Enders were extremely efficient at moving events around.Moreover,the movement of events from one place to another appeared to be an amazingly regular practice. Events were seemingly moved or relocated,transplanted,or simply removed in rapid succession. I then got the impression that there was a lot of work to do here and that there was a queue of events that needed to be moved,transplanted,or relocated in some way. I started to question what I was seeing here and as a result I sat back a moment.Every time I have discussed Event Space and Event Streams I am led to believe that we create the Event Spaces by the decisions and the choices we make and that they multiply (expand)or reduce (contract)as a result of their evolutionary benefits.This dialogue has made me understand that Event Spaces and Event Streams can be moved and modified to suit new locations in the Event Space or overall/overarching Event Stream.What I am seeing here is that the Deliverers, under the direction of the Beginners and Enders,are moving the locations of Event Spaces,and modifying them to suit or not as the case may be,all of the time,on a super regular basis. Does this mean that we have even less of an idea about the events within the Event Spaces and their Event Streams?I was starting to think as well that most of the Curators deal with the management and manipulation of Event Space and Event Streams and not the minute detail of maintaining an environment for us to exist within.I knew that this was not correct of course because I have received the summaries for each genre of Curator,but nevertheless,it did make one think.

SE1:This is making you think a bit,isn't it? ME:You bet it is. SE1:Then I will elaborate.The Deliverers work on the directives given by the Beginners and the Enders,and they are very good at it.The issue for you here is that your paradigms are being broken again.You expected a fundamental function of the structure of The Origin, Event Space,to be totally autonomous and self-maintaining.It can be,but it can also be manipulated by entities with the correct levels of functionality.You also expected that everything was totally linear in terms of the way Event Space and Event Stream operate.It can be,but it can also be manipulated and as a result become nonlinear in operation while also being linear in function-operation and function being two separate ways of working. What you are confused about is that"everything"needs to be maintained to a certain level to allow the evolutionary efficiency of its overall function to be maintained. ME:Yes,I understand that,but what it looks like to me is that nothing is left to chance; there is no randomness,no true randomness in the multiverse.Everything looks as if it is steered and that nothing is made through choice. SE1:The choices that are made by those entities/beings that use the opportunity to accelerate their evolutionary progression through the use of incarnation are the aspect of randomization of a well-oiled and maintained multiversal machine.This is because of the immersion experienced within the Event Space.It is the so-called mistakes that are individually and collectively made that create an Event Space that is out of harmony with the expected,or to use a better word,"desired"Event Space that is managed by the Curators,and in this instance the Deliverers,who act on behalf of the Beginners and Enders. ME:So everything is manipulated? SE1:No.Although it seems like it is from your standpoint,the major manipulation from the perspective of the Curators in general is to the optimal positional location or existence of an Event Space or an Event Stream. ME:So,from the perspective of those entities that are working within the Event Space that is being relocated or manipulated to allow relocation,there is no difference or no difference that can be detected? SE1:We have been down this road before,but the answer is the same.Some entities sense a difference;others do not.Rarely some know what is/has happened and work within their new Event Space and the environment within it that is created as a result of that Event Space being created. ME:OK.Got it. SE1:It might be useful to look at the reasons again for the dots and dashes that represent an Event Space being moved,transplanted,or removed. Move,Transplant,Replace,or Remove:The Maintenance of an Event Stream.

SE1:It is most important to know why an Event Space and its environment needs to be moved,transplanted,replaced,or removed within an Event Stream to be able to understand how the integrity of an Event Stream is maintained. ME:Why?I mean,most of incarnate mankind don't pay attention to the planet they are on. Why would they need to understand why an Event Space is moved? SE1:Simply because it provides some knowledge on how the Greater Reality that you exist within functions.It also gives theoretical physicists,who are on the border of spiritualism in their thinking,a way marker,should they decide to delve into your work and the work of others like you.Like you always say,today's spiritualism and metaphysics is tomorrow's science. ME:OK.Got it. You made me change the title of this section to include the words "Maintenance of an Event Stream."Is this not what we have been discussing all along? SE1:Yes,of course,but this is a specific function of the Deliverers and although they work on behalf of the Beginners and Enders,they also have to work with their own understanding of the demands of the Beginners and Enders. ME:Well,I suppose it makes sense to understand why one is doing what one is being asked to do before blindly doing it.

SE1:Correct.First of all,though,we will discuss this from the perspective of just one Event Stream,while recognizing that the decisions being made here can affect the movement, transplantation,replacement,or removal of an Event Space from one Event Stream to another as well.It's just a deeper level of understanding,one that functions within an Event Stream and between Event Streams. ME:We have already discussed the movement of Event Spaces from one Event Stream to another,and I am sure we will discuss it again with the next genre of Curators.But as you say,this is in essence a deeper level of understanding. SE1:Yes,it is and it is most important to go over this "old ground"a few times to allow it to sink in,so to speak.Let's get on with the descriptions then. Moving an Event Space An Event Space can only be moved if its outcomes,that being the connectivity with the resulting Event Space that is created from it,becomes locationally disharmonious with that resulting Event Space.This effectively means that the Event Space itself is disharmonious with the overall trend of the Event Stream when in the position it is in. Event Spaces are only locationally disharmonious if the entities and beings working within it make it that way as a result of their decisions.The disharmony,however,should not be big enough to necessitate the need to remove the Event Space altogether from the Event Stream and quarantine it.In this instance,it can be moved to a position within the Event Stream that is more in keeping with the resulting connectivity of the Event Space,or it can be placed in parallel with the modified Event Stream where the preceding and resulting Event Spaces are joined together.This effectively allows the Event Space to continue within the Event Stream but without affecting the resulting Event Space as it was previously.The entities and beings within the moved Event Space also move with that Event Space. Transplanting an Event Space An Event Space should only be transplanted from one location within the Event Stream to another if the Event Space's experiential and evolutionary performance would benefit from it being in a location where a functionally,experientially,or evolutionary similar Event Space is not providing the desired connectivity to the resulting Event Space.The reciprocal possibility is also necessary with the Event Space that is being replaced(not the same as being replaced in the section later)is better placed in the location of the first Event Space.You could call this"swapping locations"within the Event Stream if you wish,but transplanting is more appropriate a word in this instance because the entities and beings within the Event Spaces being moved,move into the transplanted Event Space and do not move with their primary Event Space. Replacing an Event Space An Event Space is replaced with a new Event Space when the perpetuation of an Event Space in that location is required but the primary Event Space itself is disharmonious in its connectivity with the preceding Event Space and the resulting Event Space.In essence, the need for an Event Space in this location is a necessary key component of a series of Event Spaces within the Event Stream.It cannot be transplanted or moved due to the level of disharmony and the impact of the disharmony with the downstream Event Spaces and the effect it has on the upstream Event Spaces'ability to connect,due to causing continuity errors. In this instance,a totally new Event Space,totally blank of entity-created events while actually being devoid of entities,is introduced to ensure there is no disharmony between the preceding and resulting Event Spaces.This Event Space is in effect just providing a connection between the two Event Spaces with a series of static micro-events in place to ensure there is a logical progression between the preceding and resulting Event Space.It is used when simply removing the disharmonious Event Space and joining the preceding and resulting Event Spaces is ineffectual. In the event that a fully functional and populated Event Space is required to fill the connectivity gap between the preceding and resulting Event Spaces then a newly created and populated Event Space without the disharmonies can be introduced.Additionally, if a similar and parallel Event Space is already in existence and can be moved without detriment to its Event Stream then that can also be utilized.However,in both these situations this would be classified as transplantation. Removing an Event Space An Event Space can be removed in its entirety and not replaced if its experiential and evolutionary functionality is disharmonious and the end of the preceding and start of the resulting Event Spaces can be modified to allow a seamless level of connectivity,effectively negating the need for the Event Space to remain in place or for a replacement to be introduced. The Event Space being removed is then subjected to(forced into)the normally automatic function of merging.This is so that the experiences of the parallelized entities and beings is reintegrated within the Event Space and Event Stream in the position where they would normally have reintegrated when the accrual of experiential and evolutionary content reaches a dead end.Within this process,all disharmonies are dissolved. ME:I would guess that this is just a high-level description of the reasons why the Deliverers manipulate Event Spaces? SE1:It is,but even though it is high level,it forms the basis of the reasons why Event Spaces are moved,transplanted,replaced,and removed. Let's get on to the Waymakers.They also deal with Event Space,as do the four genres of Curator afterward! ME:Good,I am starting to get all Event Spaced-Out!

## The Waymakers 

My comment in the last chapter seemed to be a pertinent one.To be honest,I was getting a little exasperated as well.There appeared to be a never-ending series of entities that were working with the multiversal environment from an Event Space and Event Stream perspective. I was very worried that you,dear reader,would be thinking the same,and would be minutes away from putting the book down and using it as a doorstop.It was therefore with some delight that I received the news that there were only four more Curators,after the Waymakers that is, that deal with the manipulation of Event Space and their Event Streams.I needed a change in direction,and I was feeling that my readers would need one as well.Noting that this was not going to happen in the next few chapters,I decided to get my head down and get on with the task at hand.Anyway,I thought,we are receiving a depth of detail about the use of Event Space by the Curators that we haven't had before. SE1:Correct.You,that is incarnate mankind,haven't experienced this level of detail and it is only through dialogue with me about the roles and responsibilities of the different genres of Curator that this depth becomes available.If you are getting bored with this subject,make it more interesting by asking more questions. ME:I am not bored;I am just worried about the level of detail and whether it will be attractive to my readers. SE1:It's the detail that will attract your readers,not whether or not YOU think they will be bored by it.Remember,by trying to manipulate the level of detail that you are delivering to the metaphysical public,you are stopping those who are capable of assimilating that detail and understanding the concepts that surround them. ME:Touche.Let's move on then,and I will try to become more inventive and searching with my questions. SE1:Here we go then.The Waymakers are quite possibly one of the most specialized groups of beings within the Curators.The only exception being those entities that work on the environmental functionality of a local environment or habitat (a planet,for instance). They ensure that the work of the Beginners and Enders has a seamless insertion and withdrawal point relative to the effects of all Event Spaces and their fractals.They work on each parallel condition as it is created or uncreated to ensure that the changes experienced by the beings in these Spaces are minimalized to the point of incoherence,meaning that the beings themselves are not aware of the changes new parallel conditions create as they are affected by them. ME:These beings seem very much like they do the work of the Deliverers. SE1:At first glance I would agree with you,but it's the detail behind what they do which makes their specialization different from the Deliverers. One way to look at the work of the Waymakers is to consider it as being focused on ensuring that there is continuity with the events,environment,and interactions that are experienced by those beings/entities that are within the events and their parallelizations but that these parallelizations are a function of the work of the Beginners,Enders,and Deliverers. ME:I have an image to work with and share now.The work of these beings really is detailed. They see the changes that are needed at the actual point of a being or entity's experience to ensure that they really don't have any continuity errors in their experience when a parallel or fractal Event Space is created. SE1:Correct.They see the overall effects of the Beginners,Enders,and Deliverers on the downstream individualized and collective decisions of the beings or entities within their Event Space and how they interface with the Event Spaces that are proposed to be interfaced with their Event Space.They identify the areas of potential continuity error and work on ways to reduce those errors to a bare minimum or even zero. ME:Wait a minute.What I can see here is that they move along the natural progression of the events within the interconnecting Event Spaces seeing where there are gaps or directional changes within the lines of continuity.I am just being told that this is very important work because an Event Space has a purpose that is unique to it and only it and that that purpose in terms of its inception and fulfillment must not change,else it negates its existence.These connections between preceding and resulting events of Event Spaces that are being moved,relocated,transplanted,or otherwise,is therefore of supreme importance because the objective is to make those interfacing aspects of the events within the Event Spaces function in a way that is consistent with the lines of continuity to the point of seeing no perceivable difference.

SE1:Now you are getting it.The Waymakers do just as their name describes:they create the ways which ensure that there is no loss of continuity.In essence,they are the engineers of the ways to keep continuity,even when there are none,or the result could be that no continuity may result later.If you take it down to the very close level of detail that they need to work on,you will see that they have the ability to change the ways in which individual entities or beings respond to their environment and how they interact with other entities or beings within that environment to ensure that continuity is maintained. ME:But they don't actually do that themselves,do they? SE1:No.They identify what needs to be done and how it is done.It is the responsibility of the Integrators to perform the "hands-on"work,so to speak.However,they do their work in a number of steps.They "try out"what they are proposing first before they ultimately pass on the methods of modification and the depth of those modifications that are necessary to the Integrators.In order to do this,they move along the lines of continuity performing various levels of tests to see what modification creates the most harmonious lines of continuity. In order to do this,they move outside the Event Spaces being worked on,those being inserted,removed,transplanted,or parallelized and look at the fine detail in terms of the accuracy of continuity of those events that span the whole length of the event or events within the Event Spaces.It is only when they are satisfied that the lines of continuity are harmonious,that they advise the Integrators of the work that they are required to do.

ME:I very much feel that the Waymakers are good at paying attention to detail,even right down to doing a lot of the work that the next genre of Curators,the Integrators,perform. SE1:They do work hard.In fact,I am glad that you mentioned that they perform a lot of work that the Integrators perform.It's not that they do their work for them (it's the other way around),so much as they create the overall need for the work that the Integrators perform. You will notice that there is a lot of interaction with each of the genres of Curator. ME:Yes,I do.It almost feels that they are one amorphous mass of maintenance entities. SE1:Maybe that is a reasonable thought process,but I was looking more at the convolution and interactive interdependence of what they do rather than that they may feel as if they do each other's work and that,from what I can see in your mind,there is no actual need for the different genres of Curator. ME:Yes,well,that was in the back of my mind. SE1:That being said then,the next description may reinforce that thought process incorrectly,simply because the description of the work that they do will sound similar to other descriptions. ME:I will try to remain open-minded and look for the deeper meaning then. SE1:Good.

The most important function that the Waymakers perform is to work on changing the minds of entities,their decisions and ways they interact with their environment and other entities within that environment. ME:Hold on a minute.I thought that it was the role of the Guides and Helpers to change the minds,the directions of an incarnate entity? SE1:Ordinarily that is correct,but the directions given by the Guides and Helpers are relevant to the life plan of the incarnate entity they are responsible for.When the Waymakers work on changing the minds of an incarnate entity,they are working on the details surrounding making the events between two or more Event Spaces link together. ME:How do they make an entity change its mind or thought process or direction? SE1:First of all,they need to work with the Guide and Helpers of the incarnates that they need to work with to ensure that the overall life plan of the incarnate is not compromised. Remembering of course that a life plan is only a series of achievements that an incarnate entity has chosen;how it experiences or completes those achievements is fluid and can be changed.The only requirement is that the achievement is met in some way. ME:But aren't there achievements within the life plan that are surplus,that are extras that can be invoked in the event that the incarnate entity completes its,shall we say,minimum achievement requirement?

SE1:Yes,of course.What you don't know is that the total number of achievements within a life plan can be mixed and matched within reason.As a result,this makes the life plan more achievable and,more importantly,more adaptable to the vagaries of the incarnate entities' interactions with its environment and other incarnates within that environment. ME:So is there a nucleus of achievements within a life plan that must be met,that the Guide and Helpers must help the incarnate entity experience above all others and therefore the Waymakers cannot effect? SE1:Yes.There are mainstream achievements that an incarnate entity must meet,but the level of experience gained with that achievement is also variable.As long as the achievement is made,how big it is isn't important.Although,there are those who from the Earth perspective would say that if the achievement was to be a doctor then being a famous surgeon or important consultant suggests that the achievement is more successful than being a general practitioner or just a general doctor within a hospital.In this example,being a doctor is the achievement,which has been met.The level of experience is designated by the depth of achievement,irrespective of status or fame resulting from it. ME:So as long as the nucleus of achievements is met,everything else in the life plan, achievement-wise,can be manipulated by either the Guide and Helpers or the Waymakers? SE1:That's right. ME:So just how does a Waymaker change the minds,the thoughts,and directions and therefore ultimately,the experiences and achievements of an incarnate or other entity?

SE1:This may sound overly simple,but they work in the same way as the Guide and Helpers,hence the need to interact with the Guide and Helpers of the entities that they are working with to affect the changes required to necessitate the levels of interconnectivity between Event Spaces that were previously incompatible. ME:So they don't actually interact with the incarnate entities and or other entities directly? SE1:On rare occasions,yes,they do.However,in the event that they have identified key entities that need to be worked with,whose directions,thoughts,and achievements need to be manipulated to ensure that the continuity of the Event Space being worked on is consistent with the continuity of the Event Space that it is being linked with,they need to work with the entities that are experts in knowing the incarnate entity and its ways of working.Those entities are the Guide and Helpers.Why are you chuckling? ME:Well,it's just that I am seeing a picture of a Waymaker whispering in the ear of an entity,trying to persuade it to change its mind from the current direction it is going in to one that is in favor of the direction that the Waymaker wants it to go in. SE1:Oh,I see.Well,that is the job of the Guide and Helpers if you want to think of it in that way.As I have just stated,it is only on very rare occasions when a Waymaker will directly intervene,having an importance above those of the Guide and Helpers,to change the mind and direction of a key entity if that entity is the nexus of a nest of changes and that the importance of the change in direction is more than that of the life plan in its current and expected/predicted levels of achievement.In this instance,the planned life plan may be changed with those achievements that are already experienced,recorded,and those achievements that are planned or are still in the nucleus of achievements modified to suit the greater need.The entity affected is compensated for any evolutionary gains being missed. ME:If the Waymakers work at this low level to ensure that the entities working within the Event Space are experientially compliant to the needs of the local continuity of the Event Spaces being joined,who works with the environmental changes at this level to support the entities that have been made to change direction? SE1:The Integrators!

## The Integrators 

I had just returned from a few days'break from working on this book and I noted that in the first summary in the start of this dialogue The Source stated that the Integrators performed the groundwork of the Waymakers.That they are the beings that weave the different events together into a seamless holographic state so that each Event Space is in contact with each other Event Space either directly or indirectly through direct and indirect contact with other events. Having absorbed the information in the dialogues with The Source about the work of the Beginners,Enders,and Waymakers,I was a little troubled.I couldn't see what additional work they could perform that was above and beyond that which we had already talked about.I sat here at my computer and waited for my link to The Source to establish itself with me,to allow The Source to explain how the statement about the work that the Integrators make is different from what we had already discussed and what I already knew.As usual,The Source had an explanation for this,and my concerns and worries were put to one side. SE1:It is possibly a little difficult for you to see the differences in the work that some genres of Curator do when they work so closely together.For me and those entities that are not incarnate,it is easy to see the differences for they,like you when disincarnate,have specific energetic signatures. ME:Thank you.So just what work do they do to weave the different events together into a seamless holographic state so that each Event Space is in contact with each other? SE1:First of all,you need to realize that the Integrators,as with the Waymakers,work on the delivery side of the roles that the Curators have to perform in maintaining the overall functionality of the multiverse.This means that they work on finer detail,much finer,than those Curators that we have previously discussed. Let me continue then by resetting a mental process for you to use.Normally,Event Space and Event Streams function,that being,they multiply (expand)and divide (contract), on an automatic basis,creating new Event Spaces and Event Streams resulting from the interactions between entities and the environment they are working with within the Event Space and Event Stream,including the possibilities associated with them.The work of the genre of Curators that work with Event Space is to manipulate it from that which functions automatically,to that which is desired or needed by the Curators,to ensure the evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse and its environments is maintained at an optimal level at all times.This means that the overall functional strategy for the multiverse is continually being fined-tuned,so to speak. ME:Yes.I remember you advising me of this,more than once or twice. SE1:It is good practice to keep reminding you and your readers of the processes and ways in which the Curators are working because it can all become a blur. ME:Agreed. SE1:Good.Getting back to your question then,the Integrators look at all of the changes that are being made from the highest level down,and work on the integration of those Event Spaces that are about to be changed as a result of the work of the Waymakers.They achieve this from the perspective of understanding how the "changed minds"of those entities that are considered to be key to introducing continuity between Event Spaces actually affect those Event Spaces and act accordingly. In previous dialogues on the manipulation of Event Space and their Event Streams,we have considered it from the position of the overall or overarching Event Space.The work of the Integrators,being a collaboration with the work of the Waymakers,and in some ways feeding into the work of the Seed Makers [see next chapter-GSN],focuses on those Event Spaces that are local to the entities or beings that create them. ME:I am just receiving an image of what they do.I shall explain it. SE1:Be my guest. ME:They connect together those Event Spaces that are local to the individual entities.It's a bit like molecular cohesion or molecular splicing.To ensure that the overall or overarching Event Spaces that are being connected together are totally connected and that continuity is maintained at the point of interface of any interconnecting Event Space,they work at the entity level.They work on connecting those Event Spaces localized to a particular entity or key entity by placing them in the correct interfacing event.Localized Event Space is an individualized version of the overall or overarching Event Space and as such creates a localized reality as well. The Integrators work on maintaining the cohesion between existing local Event Spaces or creating an interface between those local Event Spaces,those that are at the connecting interface between two overall or overarching Event Spaces that are being linked together. The work of the Waymakers is to change the minds or directional thoughts of the entities and key entities that are the interfacing events within the two Event Spaces.However,the Integrators manipulate the realities created by the localized Event Spaces at entity level to ensure that those realities created by the local Event Spaces support each other's existence creating continuity,plausibility,and therefore context. I see that the creation and manipulation of realities here is the key because at the entity level,and certainly the incarnate entity level,it is the interdependence of realities created by the localized Event Spaces that maintains the cohesion between the overall or overarching Event Spaces.It is context that keeps the interaction between realities coherent because when realities that are out of context are linked together,the entities that have created the realities start to question them,breaking the cohesion between the realities and therefore the local Event Spaces. SE1:Very good.And this attention to detail is why I called it holographic. ME:This is OK in terms of the overall explanation,but how do they change the relationship between an individual's localized Event Space and its relating reality?Just how do they stitch them together? SE1:They work on the relationships between the local Event Spaces,local Event Streams, and the resulting realities of individuals and collectives of individuals that interact or could interact with the Event Spaces that need to be linked together.

Using those local Event Spaces that are normally or naturally linked together as a template for context,they see what changes need to be made to allow the plausibility of one local Event Space being linked with another that it is not currently linked with. ME:Is this not the same as cohesion or context? SE1:No.Cohesion is that which results from the plausibility of one Event Space being linked to another in a natural,or if not natural,a compatible,way.Context is the overarching subject matter that the Event Space is created from.Plausibility is therefore the level of probability that two unrelated Event Spaces could be linked together. ME:I don't quite get it! SE1:Think of it in these terms.If you saw a mobile phone in the hands of a person dressed in medieval clothes in a medieval environment,you would think that the two are out of context,that the person dressed in the medieval clothes in the same environment could not possibly have such a device because that technology and its infrastructure was not available at that time. ME:That's right.I would start to wonder if the mobile phone actually existed.I would also wonder if I was actually hallucinating. SE1:Of course you would,and that is because the two are out of context and therefore the two Event Spaces that are linked together that allowed that image to be in existence could not coexist and therefore are not cohesive and the two being linked together is not plausible.There is therefore no relationship. On the other hand,if the person in medieval clothing is not actually in a medieval Event Space,but is in a representation of medieval Event Space in an Event Space where there is the mobile phone technology,such as in a medieval reenactment,then the two together,although being out of context,are nevertheless plausible.In this case,there can be cohesion between the two Event Spaces and they can be linked together.There is a relationship. In the case of two local Event Spaces that are not linked together,the Integrators create an interfacing event that allows plausibility between the events within the two local Event Spaces that are to be linked together,therefore creating cohesion between the two and a relationship. ME:And this works even if they are out of context? SE1:Yes,it does.You see,if in the minds of the entities affected by,or who created,the local Event Spaces,it can be seen that the two events within the linked Event Spaces are plausible,then that level of plausibility is reinforced and becomes cohesive. You are aware that Event Spaces can and are created through the possibility of something happening or coming into being? ME:Yes,I am.

SE1:And you are also aware that an Event Space can also be created if there is the remotest chance of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities? ME:Yes,I am. SE1:Then you will recognize that the variations on possibilities can also be used by the Integrators to create the interfacing events required to create plausibility between two events and therefore two Event Spaces,creating a relationship. ME:I guess they must be able to if you are advising me as such. SE1:Yes,I am and,yes,they can and do.I will also advise you that they not only use all of the variations of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities to create the interfacing event,but they also need to work on them as well. ME:Why?Ah!Don't tell me.It's because the different variations of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of possible possibilities change with the introduction of the new event. SE1:That's right. ME:Incredible.What I am seeing now is an image of all of the Event Spaces that are created or that need to be worked on by the Integrators.It's based upon an image I have seen and described before. SE1:Go ahead and explain it.

ME:OK.Every Event Space that is created creates the possibility of a new Event Space fractal.This is also the same for those Event Spaces that are linked together by the Integrators when there was previously no link.But what I hadn't appreciated was that this is not a 2D representation,as I had seen and described in the past,but that it is 3D [what we humans call 3D,that is-GSN].The best way to describe it is like seeing a tree,like seeing how a tree's branches grow and divide and grow and divide.No,it's more like seeing a series of trees where the trunks of the trees oppose each other with the trees themselves joining at the tips of the ends of the branches.It's like one tree is on top of another tree with the one on top being upside down.There is more,though.The image I am seeing now is that there are lots of trees all joined at the tips of the branches.It's like a big ball of treetops all joined together with the trunks sticking out from the treetop ball.The branches are the fractals and where Event Spaces link together and the trunk is the resulting mainstream Event Space. Again there is more,though.Just when I thought that the trunks indicated that this was the evolutionary end of an Event Space and its Event Streams the trunk starts to fractalize again.There is no end to this ebb and flow of the creation and dissolution of Event Spaces. As I zoom out I also see that there is no end to the size of this image.It's ended up looking like a huge fluffy tree-like ball of Event Spaces that fills every aspect of space within the multiverse. SE1:It also fills every aspect of space within The Origin as well.

ME:I bet that the Curators are glad that they don't have to work with the structure and the Event Spaces within the wider environment of The Origin? SE1:Of that they are most pleased.Come on,let's move on to the Seed Makers.These Curators work on even smaller Event Space detail than the Integrators.They can also create the possibility of plausibility and therefore the relationships between events.

## The Seed Makers 

I looked at the previous summary for this genre of Curator and got excited.I sat back a moment and thought about what I hadjust said.What am I so excited about,you might think?Mmmm! Upon reflection I decided that I had best let you,dear reader,read the summary yourselves before I express why I am so excited. The Source Entity had stated that the Seed Makers are the creators of small events,very small events,and that they are capable of being inserted or withdrawn from the totality of Event Space without affecting those beings that are working within the normal functions of the events themselves.The reason that they are called Seed Makers is because the events they insert allow the creation of much bigger events to be created on what appears to be a natural level,that being,as a natural fractal(later larger fractals)of an Event Space or series of Event Spaces or Event Streams.Apparently,this function can also act in reverse as where the withdrawal of an event can also be seen as the natural demise of an Event Space resulting from it reaching its natural evolutionary conclusion at the point of the withdrawal of that event.Knowing what I/we know about how Event Space can and is manipulated by various genres of Curator now makes me think that an event that is removed without the correct and remedial work being undertaken can and does result in the natural demise of the Event Space that that event is a function of.But is this really correct?The Source decided to put me straight before we started to get into the discussion and description about the Seed Makers. SE1:I am going over old ground here but in the natural order of Event Space functionality, that being,when there is no external manipulation by one of my Curators,an event cannot be removed as a result of natural Event Space function.Removal of an Event Space,no matter how small or inconsequential,is not part of its normal function,even though Event Space itself is intelligent.If an Event Space is left to its own devices,the events within it are naturally created and/or fractalized by the decisions of those entities that exist within it. They are also naturally dissolved/defractalized by the decisions of those entities that exist within it.Events and Event Spaces within the overall or overarching Event Space always ebb and flow in this way.This is a natural function that occurs even if there are no entities within an Event Space because the environment within the Event Space also changes as a result of the forces and energies within that environment creating myriad possibilities for environmental change. ME:So the removal,insertion,or movement of an Event Space,no matter how small,is a function that is only possible as a result of external(Curator)intervention. SE1:Correct. ME:What is fascinating me,though,is the Event Spaces that the Seed Makers are working with,what I will call microscopic Event Spaces,and introducing them or removing them without major effect on the rest of the overall or overarching Event Space. SE1:It's more than that.The microscopic Event Spaces that the Seed Makers create are capable of being introduced and/or removed from Event Spaces that are local to an individual entity or being without detriment as well.In fact,this is what they do.

ME:Can you be more explicit? SE1:The Seed Makers are not called the Seed Makers for nothing.What they do is to create microscopically small Event Spaces that are specific to the needs of an individual entity,being,or environment.They work with how the entity or being interacts with the environment or how the environment interacts with the actions of the entity or beings within the environment. In essence,what they do is create a number of new micro-possibilities that can be inserted into a local,collective,larger collective or overall or overarching Event Space in order to create a change to the wider Event Space environment from a natural perspective to one where the inserted micro Event Space is the start of the change,the catalyst.The change can be the result of a discussion with an entity's Guide and Helpers to help the entity change its direction within its life plan or,in most cases,it can be a need to change the direction of an entity,group of entities,or the environment to create a more evolutionary efficient experience.In any event,the micro Event Space inserted should not be noticeable as a catalyst until observed from further down the Event Stream.What I mean is that the micro Event Space should not be monumental in its immediate impact, so to speak,but should be subtle and create a slow but sure domino effect to the changes expected as a result of the insertion. ME:So a micro Event Space is really an event?

SE1:No,it's an Event Space in its own right. ME:I don't understand what you mean then. SE1:Consider Event Space as a bubble and I will send you an image to help you understand. I was suddenly suspended in an environment that I knew was an Event Space,an overall or overarching Event Space.I then moved into an Event Stream and was inserted into an Event Space that was localized to an entity.I didn't know what or where the entity or being was but that didn't seem to matter,it was the Event Space that was the subject here and not the entity that was creating the local Event Space.Within the local Event Space I could feel,and could have experienced if I had the time,any event that this entity had been part of or had created within its local Event Space.The Source was clearly using this entity and its Event Space as an example because it could easily have been a larger or collective Event Space.I was told to bear in mind that the Seed Makers create a number of micro Event Spaces to solve a problem or satisfy a need (see the Seeders in the next chapter)what I was about to witness was specific to a "chosen"micro Event Space and its insertion. From my vantage point in this entity's local Event Space,I saw a small sphere being inserted. This was the micro Event Space,and its role was to affect the entity in a certain way,one where it might desire to change its direction and that that direction may also influence and change the direction of other entities or beings.At first the detail within the Event Space was observed as a wild transient thought and then discarded.The Seed Makers relocated it,making the opportunity for it to be observed for a second time.This time it was observed and the entity chose to use it.As this microscopic Event Space became more dominant in the existence of the entity,it started to be more influential and grew as a result,becoming bigger and bigger.As it grew larger,it touched other local Event Spaces,linking them together.It continued to grow and became a collective Event Space which later touched other collective Event Spaces creating a bigger collective Event Space.It continued in the same fashion until it touched on and engulfed the overall or overarching Event Space,becoming the overall or overarching Event Space in its own right.It was an image of a bubble getting bigger,touching other bubbles or groups of bubbles and getting bigger,and,as a result,becoming the biggest bubble encompassing all other bubbles.It was amazing to observe. ME:So this is what you mean about what the Seed Makers do;they create the possibility of change by making an Event Space so small that it doesn't upset the natural flow of events but eventually absorbs all others and becomes the flow of events. SE1:That's right. ME:How does that work for the removal of a micro Event Space then? SE1:The removal of a micro Event Space can be considered to be the reverse of the process used in the insertion of a micro Event Space. ME:That's easy then. SE1:No,not quite.You see,when a micro Event Space is inserted,it creates the domino effect just described if that is the intention behind the insertion of the micro Event Space.The removal of a micro Event Space can create both a domino effect and an implosion or dissolution of Event Spaces.If you like,you can call it a reverse domino effect. ME:I would have thought that it would have just stopped what was expected to be created, Event Space-wise,from its point of,let's say,inception? SE1:It can do that,but that is just one scenario.You see,the removal of a micro Event Space is more complicated than inserting one. With the insertion of a micro Event Space,it is understood that it is required to create other Event Spaces,changes in paradigms,or change the direction in an entity or being's life plan.The removal of a micro Event Space is used to remove other Event Spaces,change paradigms,or change the direction of an entity or being's life plan.The only supposed difference is the creation/reduction of so-called downstream Event Spaces,but removing them,when they are in an existing Event Space and Event Stream,requires more attention to detail. ME:Are there any micro Event Spaces that do not create downstream events and Event Spaces? SE1:Yes,there are countless numbers of them.What you need to know is this,though,that the Seed Makers can see what "grows"from an Event Space perspective,what grows from the point of insertion of a micro Event Space,what dissolves from the point of removal or insertion of a micro Event Space,and what simply doesn't happen at all. 

ME:Can you explain in more detail? SE1:Yes,I will separate them out.Note that we have already described in some detail the function of Event Space growth due to the insertion of a micro Event Space,and so I will only describe it again in brief. Event Space growth due to the insertion of a micro Event Space is due to the insertion of a key event that invokes a cascade of events that affect other events and their Event Spaces, linking them together to create new localized Event Spaces and the possibility of a new overarching or overall Event Space. Event Space growth due to the removal of a micro Event Space is created as a result of the removal of a key,but nevertheless important point,in an Event Space or Event Stream that inhibits or deflects the direction of expected or desired event growth.It is usually attributed to the thought process of an entity or being and its ability to link into the events that it is required to work with to allow the downstream growth of the direction of an event. To think of it in earthly terms,try to consider the removal of an entity that resists a certain level of change that it is being exposed to or the ability to follow up a thought process or an opportunity.Another way to consider it would be to think of an inventor, say Thomas Edison,giving up after his second or third failure in making a useable electric light bulb.The removal of the thought process of failure as an inhibitor to success allowed him to continue his work and the myriad number of experiments required to reach the stage of creating the right material to manufacture a robust filament and the environment necessary for that filament to exist within to allow it to achieve a useable longevity. Event Space dissolution due to the insertion of a micro Event Space is created as a result of introducing an event that acts as an inhibitor to the initial,existing,or continuous growth of a series of events in an Event Space,ultimately resulting in the collapse of growth and dissolution of the events within the Event Space and later the Event Space itself. Another good Earth-based example of this is the loss of inertia surrounding the use of a transport modality in favor of another.A good example here is the adoption of canals over the use of roads to transport heavy goods around relatively flat countries.The insertion of a paradigm-based micro Event Space via a respected individual resulted in a change in the direction of how best to transport large quantities of cargo around a country from using what was going to be a natural progression of using roads to one where the creation of waterways was required.However,because this did not completely dissolve the road-based transportation Event Space,a subsequent micro Event Space was inserted later to change that direction back to that which was a natural progression and dissolve the Event Space that supported the paradigm of transportation via man-made waterway-but not river or sea. Event Space dissolution due to the removal of a micro Event Space is used to actively create a natural dissolution of an expected downstream Event Space due to the lack of supporting desire to progress or maintain the paradigm associated with that Event Space.

A good Earth-based example of this would be the removal of the Event Space surrounding the use of the HOTAL engine,the concept of which was developed in the late 1980s. This was purported to allow the use of a modified jet-based aero engine to remove the need for rockets used in space flight or low-orbit air transport.The desire required to support a paradigm of interested individuals in positions of authority and respect to fuel its growth was removed as an experiment in understanding the fragility of technology- based Event Spaces and their ability to be changed.The subsequent events and Event Space surrounding this technology are now poor memories only maintained in a small number of interested people.This opportunity,however,may be introduced later through the insertion of a new micro Event Space creating the desire for such technology when the supporting materials,designs,and sympathetic financial supporters are in place and incarnate mankind is more spiritually mature. Event Space stasis due to the removal of a micro Event Space is created to actively stop the key start point of an expected downstream Event Space coming into existence.One way to consider this is the removal of the confidence surrounding an invention by the inventor choosing stability of income if in a full-time and established career over initial financial uncertainty and the need for risk-taking,or the fear of a change in lifestyle.In incarnate mankind's terms,this could be considered as an opportunity lost where the micro Event Space surrounding the start of a new Event Space masks the potential associated with the new Event Space which results in its dissolution at the point of creation or even its static growth.Static growth for an Event Space can be considered as being an Event Space that does not create any fractals due to the lack of opportunities that create decision points.

SE1:There is another function of the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space. ME:And that is? SE1:That the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space is the most effective way of changing a being's life plan. ME:But we have already mentioned this.Why mention it again? SE1:I mentioned that a being's life plan can be changed earlier but that was relative to the need to change a life plan for the benefit of creating a seamless change that allows a change to an overall or overarching Event Space.This is relative to a being's life plan that has been requested to be changed by the Aspect from the energetic levels.It's usually by its Guide who has either identified a need for a change as a result of the Aspect actively desiring a change, or that the Guide and Helpers can see a potential for the incarnate Aspect being incapable of steering itself back into the main direction of the life plan if it is off course,so to speak. ME:So again,the Curators are involved not only with the maintenance of the multiversal environment,but they can also be of service to those entities or beings that incarnate? Hang on,I thought that it was difficult to change an incarnate's individual life plan? SE1:The Curators can and do interact with the Guide and Helpers of an incarnate entity. However,if the need to change an incarnate entity's life plan is a function of the need to change the Event Space it exists within by using the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space relevant to its life plan,then that is accepted as part of a higher order.If it is at the request of the Aspect,then there needs to be a good justification for the change in the life plan that requires the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space.There needs to be a rock-solid justification anyway to make a change to an incarnate entity's life plan even if it doesn't need insertion or removal of a micro Event Space. ME:Why the need for the insertion or removal then? SE1:Simply because it allows the upstream ability to change downstream events in a life plan in an easier way.This creates the condition where the entity feels that it is in control of its incarnation rather than being directed by some unknown force and the feeling that they have no control of their incarnation. ME:What you are saying then is that,at the incarnate entity/being level,the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space is to invoke the possibility of the incarnate making the choices and decisions that result in it going in the new and desired life plan direction and not the actual changes themselves? SE1:Correct.This creates the best seamless scenario possible and one that removes any downstream disharmony or irregularities.It is the most efficient way to change a life plan but needs significant backroom planning,so to speak,hence the need for rock-solid justifications.Having said that,I reiterate that changes to a life plan are not normal and are avoided because the Aspect (TES),Guide,and Helpers agreed to the life plan prior to authority to incarnate being given,therefore the life plan must have been achievable by that Aspect.Changing a life plan is therefore a major digression from the agreed plan. We have spoken enough about the Seed Makers.Let's move on to the Seeders. ME:OK.

## The Seeders 

SE1:The Seeders are a group of Curators that work for the Seed Makers.They have a rather interesting role insomuch as they have the authority and ability to skillfully choose the micro Event Space/s in which to insert or withdraw within the seed Event Space [the one to be changed-GSN].Think of it in terms of a number of micro Event Spaces being available, as a result of being created by the Seed Makers,with each of them creating the desired change to the overall or overarching Event Space.They are able to choose the best micro Event Space to use and the moment of insertion.To achieve this,the Seeders work with "what if"scenarios created by working with The Source's energetic memory and choosing the optimal moment of insertion or withdrawal. As with all entities that work with Event Space,they have the capability of manipulating it. Even though Event Space is a pan-Origin intelligent energy in its own right,those entities that absorb themselves in its functionality are eventually able to manipulate it. ME:What you are suggesting here then is that,even at this level of entity,they are not absolutely clear about how Event Space works and have to run a number of checks to see which inserted or removed micro Event Space achieves the best result? SE1:Yes,fun,isn't it! ME:Sorry,I don't understand! SE1:Event Space is very adaptable and when a change is made,a whole new set of possibilities,the possibility of possibilities,and the possibility of possible possibilities becomes available.Although,the dialogue we are having now suggests that the manipulation of Event Space is an exact science from the perspective of beings such as the Curators,it is not. ME:I am just getting a picture of what you are suggesting. SE1:Go on. ME:Well,what I am seeing is that to truly steer Event Space to a desired or required Event Space and Event Stream,there needs to be constant changes to the fine detail via the insertion or removal of micro Event Spaces to allow the desired/required Event Space to be invoked.This is the reason for the ability to choose from a number of micro Event Spaces while also having the ability to choose which one is suitable for which insertion/removal point within the Event Stream.From the perspective of the Seeders and other Curators,it all looks as if the Event Space that is being worked on is constantly under recalibration or manipulation,but from the perspective of those entities or beings in the environment created by the overall or overarching Event Space,it feels and operates as if everything is in a logical progression. What I now see is that the Seeders,together with the use of your energetic memory and the ability to create "what if"scenarios,and observe their functions from start of event to end of event,are able to create a portfolio,for want of a better word,of optimal micro Event Spaces to insert and/or remove at various points in the Event Stream of the overall or overarching Event Space to create the optimal Event Space that allows what is required of that Event Space from an interactive and evolutionary perspective to come into fruition. SE1:And all of this includes the fractals as well,don't forget. ME:Yes,how could I forget the fractals?Hang on,I was being flippant,of course!The amount of work they have to do includes all of the fractal Event Spaces as well,hence the need to choose from a number of micro Event Spaces and a number of insertion/removal points within the Event Stream.So when I was thinking of just one Event Space and one Event Stream that they work on,they also work on the hidden detail of all the parallel versions that are being created. SE1:Yes,of course. ME:Why do they need to work on the fractal Event Spaces and Event Streams? SE1:Because,as I have stated many times,these fractals also provide parallel opportunities for experiencing learning and evolving,doubling,trebling,and quadrupling,etc.,etc.,etc., the ability to accrue the maximum possible evolutionary content that an incarnate or disincarnate entity or being can,within an experience and its fractals. ME:Yes,I am aware of that,but it doesn't stop me from asking the same questions time and time again.I am aware that Guides and many of the Curators have the ability to work on multiple Event Spaces,those being the fractals created and dissolved through the choices made by the entities or beings within the environment that they work in.I am also aware that different genres of Curator work around the fractals in different ways.I am just trying to understand how the Seeders work with the different fractals of the micro Event Spaces they plan and choose to use in their role. I do have one other question first,though,and it is not quite related to the Curators per se, but it is to the nomenclature used. SE1:Carry on. ME:Well,it is a bit basic but it is one that I feel will be important to the readers. SE1:As I said,carry on. ME:What is the difference between a being and an entity?I mean,we have both used them in the same context throughout this dialogue,but if that was the case,why use different words? SE1:It would be incorrect to say that they are one and the same thing because they are not. I will elaborate. It is all to do with the sentience.A being is a small individualized unit of me,one that has a nominal level of sentience that is assigned to a body of energy by me.This can be a TES,an Aspect of a TES,or a Shard of an Aspect.It can also refer to the creator of that individualization,which can be used to describe the relationship between The Origin and I.The demarcation here is that it is created by another being of higher or similar sentience. An entity is created through the natural attraction of similar or sympathetic energies that develops its own intelligence as a result of groups of energies moving together to create a bigger group of intelligent energies.Once the intelligence grows to the point of being able to make deliberate decisions about attracting other energies,and those energies that are attracted also have enough intelligence to choose to enter into an attracted or communal state,the intelligence is on the road to changing its status to consciousness and later creativity with sentience being much further down the line [see The Origin Speaks-GSN]. ME:So to summarize,a being is created through the separation/individualization of existing sentience and/or energy,and an entity is created through intelligent attraction of energy leading to sentience. SE1:That is reasonable enough.You see,a being is already sentient whereas an entity may be at any point along the road to sentience including being in the low-intelligence but nevertheless decision-making point,or in fact,fully sentient.One is created sentient whereas the other actually evolves to the point of being sentient-both can make decisions that result in the creation of a new Event Space. ME:I am really glad we got that one out of the way.Moreover,it's really good to know that there are reasons for the use of these words and that we are not just duplicating the description. SE1:I would never do that.It's just not an efficient or effective way of describing a concept. We should go back to the first question you had on understanding how the Seeders work with the different fractals of the micro Event Spaces they plan,and choose to use,in their role.

I want you to consider that the Seeders have the capability to link themselves with the micro Event Spaces that they are planning to use and insert into the various scenarios they study before they choose them as "live"micro Event Spaces.When they use my energetic memory,they are capable of both being the observer and the participant of the functions and actions resulting from the insertion of the micro Event Space they are working with and the insertion or removal point that they are expecting to use.I will send you an image of how they work so that you can describe it. ME:Thank you.I can see the image of a single Seeder.It appears to be at what I can only describe as a viewing portal.The viewing portal is the access to your energetic memory.This viewing portal is not in what incarnate mankind would call two-or three- dimensional display;it is aligned as a function of event experiences,the alignment of which is in the logical progression of the events as they unfold. SE1:A Seeder,seen as a ball of pure sentient energy,chooses from a selection of micro Event Spaces that are also represented by a ball,a ball of Event Space.This ball is inserted at a certain point in an Event Stream,one where there is a known fractal probability and where the fractals of this probability are seen,and new Event Spaces of various sizes and fractal divisions are created.Event Streams are also created as a result.These are the directions in which the fractals go and in which new fractals can and are created.The Seeder is in two positions I note;one where it is the observer of the creation or dissolution of Event Spaces and/or Event Streams,and another where parts of it are taken with the micro Event Space that it has inserted.It appears like there are lots of little lines being projected or pulled from the Seeder.These are bits of itself following the micro Event Space at its point of insertion and following all of the Event Stream and Event Space fractals.The Seeder is both inside and outside the unfolding Event Spaces and the Event Streams.In this way,it can both observe and experience all of the possible events created,or not as the case may be,and all of their possibilities concurrently.It knows when its level of understanding of the ultimate outcome desired from the insertion point is assured and ends the scenario.Choosing the next micro Event Space and maybe a new insertion point,it returns to being both the observer and participant again,with a new set of fractals being created. ME:Isn't having all those strings flowing from them to each micro Event Space and other resulting Event Spaces a burden for them in terms of their ability to process all the information that they are receiving? SE1:There is a point where they can manage on their own,so to speak,but when the amount of work they have to do to follow all the Events and Event Streams becomes difficult to follow efficiently,the Seeder can mirror itself to perform this role in parallel. ME:So they have a limitation in the amount of fractals that they can work with? SE1:Not really.It's more a case of working in the most efficient and effective way possible so that they can make an educated decision as to which micro Event Spaces to use and where to insert or indeed remove them.Mirroring themselves allows them to parallel process in every way possible to allow them to do their job. ME:Placing themselves in a parallel processing or mirroring allows them to look at many Event Spaces and their fractals,but what allows them to make the detailed choice about which micro Event Space is appropriate at which insertion point or removal point? SE1:From the perspective of your incarnate human mind everything looks linear and so the mirroring function the Seeders use appears to be linearized when they look at the Event Spaces and the actions and reactions that their insertions or removals of micro Event Space and their locations create,but this is not quite correct. ME:How do you mean?I would have thought that the Seeder would need to be able to accelerate the experience of observing the effects of inserting or removing micro Event Spaces. SE1:It can and it does it in two ways.One is observational and the other is experiential. ME:Don't tell me,I can see it.A Seeder uses your energetic memory function to allow it to create the different "what if"scenarios to allow it to see the different Event Spaces that are created as a result of their work.The Seeder also needs to experience the changes to the Event Spaces that its work makes from the perspective of the entity or being who is experiencing the Event Spaces and Event Streams by moving into those Event Spaces, micro,local,global,etc.,and their fractals,and zooming in and out of them by the mirroring or paralleling process.In this way,they can zoom into the various events-and look backward,forward,up and down,so to speak.While in this "immersed"state,it can achieve and create things that it cannot do while in the observation mode of using your energetic memory.While being immersed,while being in all of the Event Spaces that are linked to the Seeder,via the lines from the Seeder to the different fractals,it can move into those individual lines with its mirrored sentience,observe its work in all of the Event Space and Event Stream fractals via your energetic memory and experience all of the Event Space and Event Stream fractals via the mirroring function,simultaneously.In this way,it can make minor modifications within a"what if"scenario to increase the efficiency of a desired outcome if the best micro Event Space is not quite perfect or acceptable in its delivery in as fast and as efficient a way possible.In essence,it can observe in both "real time"and "fast forward/reverse"for all Event Spaces and Event Streams and their fractals created as a function of the insertion or removal of the micro Event Streams chosen,and select the optimal micro Event Space/s and their insertion/removal points.They can achieve a decision as to which micro Event Space/s to use and its optimal insertion or removal points in a nanosecond from our incarnate perspective. This is amazing.From the viewpoint of the incarnate human,all of this happens in an instant.It's just like the Seeders look at a series of timelines,insert and/or remove a few changes,dive into the scenarios and their fractals,and move on to the next job they have to do. SE1:Yes.It happens in an instant and is instantly effective.All you would experience is the end product,so to speak,and that end product is an instantaneous change that you generally don't perceive. ME:Yes,I understand.We have discussed the ability of the entities and beings that exist or work in a particular Event Space and Event Stream perceiving any changes before.It would be unperceivable to them to notice unless they are highly evolved. I am interested in our next genre of Curator,the Beleaguerers,now.It seems almost impossible that from the summary you gave that they would be needed.They also look as if they are very similar in functionality to those universally gifted Curators that work on any of the specialisms of those specialized Curators they work with/for. SE1:To some extent,yes,but these Curators are to all intents and purposes the clean-up squad,correcting the results of misinterpretations of those entities that manipulate Event Space in any of its volumetric conditions,so to speak. ME:Are you saying mistakes are made? SE1:Not so much mistakes,more like errors that grow as a result of selecting a micro Event Space that is fit for one purpose in comparison to others,but that is not fully compatible with all the downstream fractals that can manifest.

## The Beleaguerers 

I have to admit that the idea of a group of Curators that were there to sweep up any mistakes, for want of a better word,sounded both unlikely and preposterous,especially when considering that The Source had a group of entities that were looking after the maintenance of that part of it that it had separated out from itself,that which we call the multiverse,and that they were infinitely more capable than those entities,in my mind,that are in the evolutionary cycle. Indeed,from my perspective,the possibility of the need to correct what I am going to insist upon calling mistakes or errors didn't portray the human understanding of our Source,our God,our Creator.Having entities that were capable of being somewhat less than accurate,not perfect,or even create problems was a quandary.None of this part made sense to me and I decided to keep afew questions for The Source in my back pocket to do some double-checking.An imperfect God, Mmmm! SE1:Before I answer your questioning thoughts,I will run over the description of the Beleaguerers again.These entities are a special group of entities because they are multifaceted and are skilled in all functions associated with the entities described so far and that will be described.The previous entities differ insomuch as they are multifaceted within the skill set of those higher Curators that they work with/for.Although the Beleaguerers are truly multifaceted,they tend to work mainly on the total workload to correct issues in terms of the total number of Event Spaces that could be affected if the wrong insertion point is used,or if the"what if"scenario function of The Source's energetic memory is incorrectly interpreted,which includes anything that has responded in a way that was not expected or planned. So as you alluded to,the Beleaguerers are,or operate as,a firefighting and/or clean-up function when things don't go according to plan.They operate independently of all other entities and take over the operational corrections that are needed to ensure all Event Spaces and their junctures are maintained. ME:Tell me,how can your Curators make mistakes?I would have thought that the Curators at least would be acting and working in a state of perfection so that those entities and beings that are in the evolutionary cycle have the best chance of evolving in an efficient and effective way. SE1:First,answer me these questions of you.Do you not make mistakes? ME:Yes,I do. SE1:Do you not create karma through missing the opportunity to negate it? ME:Yes,I do,we all do. SE1:Do you not find different ways of doing things? ME:Yes,of course,that's the spice of life. SE1:And do you not wish that you could have done things better? ME:Yes,that's my ego and the benefit of self-reflection.


SE1:And I allow you all to do these things and be ineffective and inefficient at times? ME:You must do so,because we are. SE1:Then you will realize that there is a certain advantage to me by allowing my creations to get things wrong or be less than perfect. ME:That would be depth of experience and that depth of experience is a function of experience,learning,and evolving. SE1:Correct.It is depth ofexperience that allows the accrual of evolutionary progression in a more accelerated way.That is why I am happy with errors creeping in. ME:Would these not be called errors but merely a function of entropy? SE1:Meaning that...? ME:Meaning that the management team for the multiverse from an Event Space perspective is a lousy function where the attempt to create a more perfect condition,does in effect,create a less than perfect condition? SE1:That is an interesting thought process you have.It is also one that I need to steer you away from. ME:Why? SE1:Simply because I can already see you going down the path of thinking that I encourage the possibility of actively seeking my Curators work in error and that I do this to see what the Curators do to get themselves out of trouble,so to speak. ME:Well,the thought did cross my mind. SE1:I know.I saw it. ME:Going back to the thought process that the Beleaguerers are in existence to correct mistakes in the unlikely event that errors do creep into the modifications to Event Spaces, micro and larger,how do they make the changes?I mean,when we look at the amount of work and the level of detail that the Seed Makers and Seeders have to do,the checking they have to do from a "what if"scenario,zooming into the Event Space and Event Stream,checking the effects and results,even before they insert a micro Event Space into an overarching/overall Event Space or Event Stream,the Beleaguerers must need to do the same level of work or checking before they effect a correction? SE1:That was a long way around to ask a question. ME:It was rather,wasn't it? SE1:Yes,it was.However,it provided a necessary preamble to your thought process and actually made a lot of sense. ME:Thank you.

SE1:The answer to your question is that they don't. ME:So what happens? SE1:Before I answer the question I want to recalibrate your thoughts a little.The Beleaguerers work on making corrections to the effects of the insertion or removal of a micro Event Space within an overarching or overall Event Space and its Event Stream.They rarely introduce a new Event Space,of any size. ME:What do they do then? SE1:Make minor adjustments to the existing Events within the Event Space.You see,it is important to not disturb too much of what is "approved"for use from the perspective of Event Space and Event Streams. ME:How do you mean? SE1:The work that the Seed Makers and the Seeders do is,in general,accurate but there are the odd occasions when those entities and beings that are within the Event Space that has been modified do something that was not seen in the "what if"scenarios.If this affects the overall direction that the Event Space and the Event Stream have been modified to go in,in terms of the Event Space fractal creation and dissolution,then minor modifications to the modifications are required. ME:And so the Beleaguerers make these modifications as fine-tuning,I guess?

SE1:Yes.In effect,this is the whole point of their work.Although you may have identified them as firefighters,they are not rescuing the Event Spaces they work with from an impending doom situation,but they are changing the so-called natural events that were created as a result of unpredicted entity or being activity back to that which was desired and agreed. ME:When we discussed the work of the other Curators that manipulate Event Space,are the changes that are made not discernible to those entities and beings that are within the Event Space?Is this the same for the work of the Beleaguerers? SE1:No.Although they are multiskilled,and can effect any fine-tuning required in any of the skills of the Curators,they prefer not to recreate the work of any of the Curators that they are working with. ME:They prefer to repair it then? SE1:That would be a better way of describing the work that they do,much better than being called a fine-tuner or a firefighter. ME:You just alluded to the point that they don't achieve a seamless change to the Event Space and Event Stream they're repairing SE1:Yes,I did say that. ME:What happens when they make a change then?

SE1:Some of the entities and beings within the Event Space see some change that is either a change that is specific to them or is a minor adjustment to their overall experience in some small way. ME:Can you explain in more detail? SE1:I will give you a working example.Have you experienced a known future or expected a series of events that seemed like they were a "certainty,"so to speak? ME:Yes,on a number of occasions I have felt that the future is certain and that I understand and know the events leading up to,and progressing from,an expected event that would be considered a milestone event.Moreover,I could see it happening without fail. SE1:OK,and have you seen events where the certainty doesn't happen for some reason? ME:Yes,I have. SE1:And have you seen events that suddenly come into existence from nowhere? ME:Yes,I have. SE1:Well,both of these are times when changes are being made as a result of the work of the Beleaguerers.They have repaired the Event Stream within the overarching or overall Event Space putting them back into the stream or sequence of events that they were or are supposed to be in. My mind went back to a couple of times when what was expected didn't happen.In the first example,my late wife,Anne,was working at Birmingham University in the UK and was struggling to find funding for her research.A member of a "natural remedy"pharmaceutical company had a long-term friendship with my father-in-law,Anne's father.This company had funded my father-in-law's metaphysical research for a number of years and had stated that they would fund Anne.Anne was a senior research fellow in medical microbiology and genetic cancer research studies at the university,and this company wanted her to provide scientific evidence for the functionality of their remedies in healing illness and ailments.This research was going to be an important and essential step in creating scientific and therefore justifiable evidence for natural preparations being a real healing medicine and not just spiritual mumbo jumbo.We were waiting for the contract to come through from the company when we had the news that a senior director was changing the way they worked.One of them was to stop any research that justified the healing effects of natural remedies and Anne's grant was removed, leaving her without funding for the foreseeable future. Within a few weeks of this information,we were on our yearly pilgrimage to the College of Psychic Studies in Kensington,London,UK.The College of Psychic Studies has a group of highly trained psychics and one of them was our favorite.She had proved to be very accurate over the years and we had returned year uponyear to her for her intuition and inspiration.We therefore had an appointment each.We always recorded these "readings"and we were both surprised to hear that the removal of the funding wasn't supposed to happen and that something outside of the expected reality had happened.

Listening to what The Source was telling me,this very much felt like one of those events that had been changed or repaired by a Beleaguerer. I then looked at my own past and saw the event surrounding my mental decision to leave the so- called day job.Based upon my previous calculations,I could do my spiritual work and day job and would be able to leave at age fifty-five with a pension.I could use my pension as a basis for paying our bills with a bit to spare for our hobbies.In the background was the fact that we had recently had a redundancy program and I found myself suddenly doing the maths again,this time without being greedy!It suddenly hit me.I could retire now!It was now!I could focus on my spiritual work now!I hadn't seen this before,it simply wasn't an option.Within six months I had left the company and was drawing my pension.I was very happy because I was working on my true path,my heart's desire,and I had a parachute.I didn't need to make a profit to be able to live and do my spiritual work. Again,this wasn't supposed to happen-yet.Something had happened to the Event Stream in both examples that made us change direction,albeit in personalized ways.Couldn't these be two examples of the work of the Beleaguerers?I wondered. SE1:In both of your examples the Beleaguerers made minute changes to the local Event Spaces of Anne and yourself.In Anne's case,it was to ensure that she was able to take leftover or surplus funds from other scientists that had grants but who had moved on, leading her to the point where she could take her university pension at an unreduced level. In your case,it was an even smaller change to your executions and realization that you needed less money than you had desired to be able to do your spiritual work full-time.

ME:I have another example. SE1:Go on. ME:My father-in-law wanted to pursue his metaphysical interests while he was working at his university position as an "out of hours"interest.He had a few students who were also interested and the only way to get everyone together was to hold meetings at the university.Being the conscientious person he was,he asked his professor if this was OK. The professor took his time,but when he replied,he stated that this would be OK as long as he realized that in doing so,he would not be able to progress in his career as a metallurgist.That being,he could not progress any further than his current grade of senior research fellow.My father-in-law was a very capable man and would have easily gained a professorship.I sensed that his professor was jealous of his work because he had created a unique and novel way of welding metals together that were normally resistant to being welded and was traveling the world lecturing on his development. My father-in-law felt that his metaphysical research was more important and accepted that his career progression was now at a dead end,even though he made many more contributions to his field.He was content with being able to make another contribution toward metaphysics,one where so-called modern science could prove that the worlds of spirit existed,that today's metaphysics was tomorrow's science. SE1:Another good illustration.If your father-in-law had been allowed to progress in his metallurgy as well,he would have gained more responsibility and that would have been an issue to him.He would have had to ensure that more and more of his time was taken up with administration of his "department,"for he would have ended up in control and responsible for his own department and would have been a professor in his own right within eleven years.This would have stopped his research with the result of him not publishing his books [The Loom of Creation and Explorations in Consciousness,which he self-published.These led up to his third and last book,Kosmos,published by Ozark Mountain Publishing.-GSN].Neither would he have been able to make contact with those other serious metaphysical researchers such as Harry Oldfield [Anne and I met Harry one night together with my father-in-law.He demonstrated his device to record the human energyfield and its changes due to disease.He is a brilliant metaphysician.-GSN]and the founder of the natural remedy pharmaceutical company who sponsored his work. ME:And this was only possible because of the work of the Beleaguerers? SE1:Entirely.The Beleaguerer in question didn't need to do much more than put a suggestion into the mind of Dennis's professor,one that was in keeping with the way his ego worked,and the direction of his life plan was secured. ME:So they really don't do big changes,do they? SE1:No.They are experts in using their multifaceted skill set to ensure that the changes to the Event Spaces,making micro Event Spaces,are easy to achieve and work within the parameters of the existing predictions made by the Seed Makers and the Seeders in order to correct or fine-tune things. Again,look at all of the things that you have experienced.Things that have happened,like you were lucky and were in the right place at the right time,or what you may sometimes think of as being the wrong place at the wrong time. I was thinking of another example where a decision was made in my old place of employment to reorganize the department.I was to move back into my old role because of the integration of two departments.Just when this was happening,the recession/depression of 2008 hit the country, resulting in redundancies in my company and my department.The role I was transitioning from was identified as redundant due to the integration.Normally this would not have been a problem and my transition would have been secure as the plans for the reorganization were finalized and populated with personnelfrom a planning perspective.It would have beenjust the role that disappeared.Our Human Resources (HR)department saw this as an opportunity to make up their redundancy figures and I was left jobless and needing to apply for roles,at and below my pay grade.I eventually gained a role,a grade and several benefits lower than where I was.The weird thing was that my new role resulted in me performing the same function that I was responsible for before the redundancies.I always thought that there was something fishy about it.I put the blame on someone not liking me at that time but I now know that this was the work of the Beleaguerers.This was in place about four years before the example above where I knew I had enough money to leave. SE1:Now you're getting it.Everything seemed as if it was out of context from the perspective of continuity but with continuity maintained. ME:That's it-that's it!The biggest thing it actually did for me was to detach me from my dedication to the company.At this time,my work on The History of God was drawing to a close and I was starting to get more interested in broadcasting my work to the metaphysical and spiritual public.I gained more spiritual stamina as a result and forged forward.I had switched my point of focus back to where it should have been.Again,I suppose in sympathy with my father-in-law's story,my life plan was recut so that I could do this work and not get immersed in my old career.My personal first example earlier,being downstream of the second,was more of an awakening moment,whereas the job loss just seemed bizarre,simply because I couldn't see what was happening. Just think,dear reader.How many times have things happened to you that you thought were out of context but that you begrudgingly accepted only to find out later that it was the best thing that had happened to you! SE1:This chapter will make your readers think back to a lot of their own examples where something happened that should not have by definition.Just think about what is happening to the UK and the US now.[The reader should refer to the recent US and UK elections 2016/2017 and the UK's vote to leave the European Union.-GSN]This is the work, the bigger work I might add,of the Beleaguerers. It's time to leave these extended discussions on Event Space and those entities that work with it and go on to the Recorders. ME:I am looking forward to it. I sat down and thought for a moment about what The Source and I had been talking about with reference to the Beleaguerers and how some of the experiences I had witnessed and been involved with had been effected by this genre of Curator.I wondered as to how many of the incarnate entities on the Earth,not to mention other planets or areas of locally low frequency within the physical universe,had experienced unexpected changes to their direction in incarnate existence. I thought again.What if all the unexpected changes in our incarnations were a result of the fine-tuning,the introduction of micro Event Spaces introduced by the Beleaguerers and other Curators who have the capability to manipulate Event Space,to keep the overall or overarching Event Space operating in the way desired by The Source.This would mean that for those entities incarnate on the Earth,that there is no such thing as true individualized free will,simply because our direction and experiences are being fined-tuned on a regular basis.I decided to ask The Source this question before moving on to the Recorders. SE1:No need to ask,it is a perfectly valid question. ME:OK,so what is the answer? SE1:The answer is yes.I do have certain desired experiences that I experience through you all and in the Greater Reality of this evolutionary cycle,I want to make sure that I/you experience or contribute toward the experience of others so that I can experience in both general and depth what I want to experience,learn,and evolve from. ME:Is this "not"true experiential evolution resulting from first-time or revised second- or third-time experience then?I mean,from what you are saying,you are picking and choosing what or how you want us to experience on your behalf?

SE1:Of course,I am,and I do this through your TES,your Guide and Helpers,and those entities that maintain that part of me which is called the multiverse.Try not to think of it in terms of being guided to the point of not being in control of your own free will,but moreover,that I and my Curators are ensuring that the experience and learning from that experience is what is desired,and that the environment and its Event Spaces and Event Streams support that desire.I/we are simply fine-tuning the actions associated with your free will.Try to think of it another way.That the whole point of what experience is,is to see if the guidance is listened to,is appreciated,understood,and used.And when it is not,then the Event Space that is changed away from the expected Event Spaces,in all of its parallel derivatives,is recalibrated back to what it should have been.This includes the individual interactions and experiences within an entity's life plan and current position within that life plan.You still have free will to do what you do in the way you want to do it in the environment it is being done in;it's just that there are times when errors creep in and that these errors need to be ironed out. ME:But aren't these errors part of the game,so to speak? SE1:Of course.But when they have been experienced,they have served their purpose.It's a bit like being on a journey and knowing the road/s you need to use and the places you need to go through to get to the end of the journey and then suddenly taking a detour,the detour being taken because something grabs your attention for a moment.Once you have seen and experienced what grabs your attention you need to get back on the main road,and, if you have time to get to your destination,you increase your speed to make up the time lost so that your arrival time is as desired.In doing so,you can interact with those entities that you planned to interact with at your destination in the environment you planned to interact with them in. ME:OK,now I understand.We have free will up to a certain point only,our point of distraction from our planned path.It is the role of the Beleaguerers to spot these distractions,and if we are not able to correct our distractions ourselves,they put us and our Event Spaces back on track. SE1:Now you have it.Now it really is time for the Recorders.

## The Recorders 

ME:The Recorders are exactly what their name describes them as-recorders.They work on the detail surrounding the work all of the other entities are responsible for,and assign the actions of those entities working on the tasks they are recording and the subsequent responses of the components of the multiversal environments to the appropriate sectors of The Source's energetic memory. It does have to be said that the Recorders work specifically on recording the information associated with the work of The Source's Maintenance Entities and not The Source itself. SE1:Well copied! ME:Thank you.I would have thought that recording what and how each of the Curators did,do,or will do was an automatic function carried out by you?Why do you need to have a specialized entity to do this? SE1:Before you say "but we all are part of you,"I will say that the Recorders are that part of me,under the guise of a Curator that is specialized in working specifically on recording the work of the Curators.However,although they have the role of Recorder,what they are really doing is an important function of my memory retention. ME:Can you elaborate a little more? SE1:As you are aware,we/you are in the third evolutionary cycle and as such everything that is,was,or will be was experienced before. ME:Yes,OK.I understand this,but maybe the readers may not.Shall I explain a little first? SE1:Be my guest. For the readers,this information in relevance to the Hindu texts on the breathing in and out of the universe can be found in The Origin Speaks as well. ME:The evolutionary cycle is a function of The Origin's desire to know and experience itself in totality.Although not originally classified as an evolutionary cycle,it has become such due to its repetition.That being,it has been experienced by all Source Entities,with the exception of SE12,and those entities and beings within those Source Entities that they have created,or have allowed the evolutionary generation of beings through intelligent energetic attraction within them,three times. Three times,I hear you all say.How can that be?I will explain further. The original evolutionary cycle was,as stated above,a function of The Origin's desire to know itself in a level of detail that was not efficiently available to it in its singular form of beingness.In order to increase this knowledge of itself,which,when it was experienced and learned created evolution,which was something that The Origin desired,decided to duplicate itself.The story of the twelve Origins is explained in The History of God and The Origin Speaks,and although it is a link to the start of the evolutionary cycle,it is not necessary to elaborate on it now for it is the experiential function of The Source Entities that is the real evolutionary cycle. There is an area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness within the totality of The Origin that it is aware of and that is fully understood.There is also a much larger area,most of this area of The Origin's understanding of self in fact,that is not yet understood,but is nevertheless known about. How can The Origin not know about itself in totality?you ask. The answer is to look at this from the human perspective.We all know ourselves and our environment including the wider environment to a certain level,but to understand our human bodies,we need to use microscopes of varying magnifications and refer to experts in the various functions of the human body to understand what we might see when looking into the microscope at our cellular and atomic structure.In order to know more about ourselves we seek counsel of those who have focused on looking deeper into the structure and functionality of the human body,those who have a specialism within a particular area and others who have specialized within the specialization within a specialization.This is where The Origin is at currently,working on creating specialist functions of sentience with the specialized functions of sentience also given the power to create further functions of specialized sentience.All of these functions of specialized sentience feed back to the originating sentience,The Origin,what they have found out about themselves,itself,and how it interacts with other specialized functions of sentience. They improve this knowledge by moving around and into those parts of The Origin that it is aware of but not fully conversant with.In this way,they improve both in the depth and the breadth of knowledge. From the human perspective,we then go further abroad,looking at our environment.We all have a basic level of knowledge about our environment even if in most cases,we have no personal experience of this wider environment.For instance,we know we exist in a house and thatthat house is in a suburb of a city,that that city is in a country,which is part of a land mass,which is on the Earth,which is a planet in a solar system,which is in a galaxy, which is in a universe,and that this universe we are now recognizing is part of a multiverse. For the most part,we know about the house we live in and the suburb that house is in, but as we go further abroad our knowledge reduces drastically the further away from our center of normal activity we move. As we investigate our wider environment further,we start to fill in the gaps in our knowledge.Some are filled with depth;others are filled with breadth and little depth. Some if not all of the wider knowledge is filled in by the knowledge given to us by others we communicate with,those who are fortunate enough to experience other countries,the people in these countries,and their cultures.Or better still,those who are capable of expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and,through various media, broadcast it for the benefit of others.None of us have,with the exception of a very few brave individuals,in the human physical state that is,traveled much beyond the confines of the planet,let alone know much about solar systems,galaxies,nebulae,universes,or even a multiverse because this is peripheral knowledge.It exists but it doesn't affect us. However,there is a small number of individuals who are investigating the "what ifs"of our environment and how we interact with it. Again,this is where The Origin is now.It is aware of its local self-environment,that area beyond but within the sphere of its area or volume of polyomniscient sentient self- awareness,in human terms,the human body.It is also aware of the structure of itself beyond that,in human terms,the house the human body lives in and the suburb it is within.However,although it has this knowledge,it is also aware due to the regularity of structure within that which it knows of itself,that there are another eleven groups of twelve sets of structure beyond that. The most important thing in the mind of The Origin is that it wants to know ALL of that which it is,and it wants to know ALL of that which it is IN DEPTH.I also know that it will be a lengthy process,one that has only just started,in this particular Event Space and it is still working on the understanding of the human body,using the human example.[The reader should also refer to The Origin Speaks for an explanation of The Origin's structure associated with its polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.-GSN]So,how is it doing this? In understanding how The Origin understands more of the area (volume)where its polyomniscient sentient self-awareness resides,we will start to understand both the reasons for and the overall function of the evolutionary cycle. SE1:Well,that was a good,if not lengthy,introduction to the explanation of the cycle. ME:It may be,but I feel that this preamble was a necessary scene setter to allow what you are allowing me to describe next.As you always say to me when we talk in private, I can give you the information in a purer context,but unless you are expansive enough to work with the information,it will always have to be explained in a humanized way. This way expands with knowledge,of course,and so the complexity of information and contexts surrounding it expand with it.Feeling that the readers will at this point start to get impatient,I had better carry on with the explanation then. SE1:I would. ME:OK.The Origin created the Source Entities to assist it in its task of understanding itself better.They were created through the basic process of recycling that sentience and the energies associated with that sentience used to create the Twelve Origins together with individualizing that energy/sentience combination with additional sentience and energy to create the Source Entities.Each Source was allowed to become self-aware in its own way and when self-aware was educated as to its reason to be and what its role was within the sentience of The Origin.The brief,so to speak,was to experience,learn,and subsequently evolve in any way they felt would be beneficial.[The stories behind what and how they are doing this are explained in summary in the Beyond the Source books.-GSN]Our Source Entity,Source Entity One [The use of the assignation Source Entity One or SEl is not an indication of which Source became self-aware first;moreover,it is simply my way of identifying the order in which I committed to a dialogue with a Source Entity,ours therefore being the first became SE1.-GSN],is the subject behind this dialogue,and as such,is the focus of this dialogue.Nevertheless,each and every Source Entity,notwithstanding SE12 follows the same process. From the perspective of you as our Source Entity,you were placed within the area or volume of The Origin where its polyomniscient sentient self-awareness resides with the remit of experiencing,learning from those experiences,and accruing evolutionary content as a result.All Sources do this,even Source Entity Twelve,although SE12 is now outside of this area/volume.This experiential/learning/evolutionary content is gained through the investigation of the experiential abilities and capabilities of the Source Entity self-while it is in a static location within the area or volume of The Origin's polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.In your case,you separated yourself out into two, while still being one.One side being you and your own personalized work,and the other being the creation of an environment,simply put,the annexing of half of you,and the creation of smaller individualized units of your own sentient energies to investigate the experiential abilities and capabilities of those annexed energies and their structures,the multiverse as we know it,discounting for the moment,the possibilities associated with Event Space.Once you/we have experienced all the possible and/or potential experiential content available in all of its convoluted variants in the location that you are in,and every entity or being has experienced that,by progressing through each and every aspect of the structure and its abilities,capabilities,and interactions with other entities experiencing the same,it can be said thatthat particular evolutionary cycle is complete. In the event that a location occupied by a Source Entity is fully known,experienced, and understood,then that location becomes part of The Origin's area or volume of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.At this point in the overall Event Space and Event Stream,the Source Entity concerned accepts all of the individualizations it has created back into its overall sentient energy,with each individualization entering into one of the many forms of communion that can be experienced when reintegrating with one's creator [see The Anne Dialogues for further detail-GSN].When all individualizations are in communion,and any individualized Source Entity structure is also reintegrated,a Source Entity is then considered to be "one"again.It can then start the process of moving the sentience away from the original,or chosen,group or body of energies used to house the individualized sentience created by The Origin and called a Source Entity,to another location.The sentience detaches from the energies used in the completed evolutionary cycle and seeks out another group of energies that have not already been used by another Source Entity. SE1:Don't forget that it is not necessary to work with the energies previously occupied by another Source Entity because the experiences,learning,and evolutionary content accrued by each Source Entity is shared by the other Source Entities and so that energetic location is already experienced by default.The way each Source Entity experiences what each other experiences is a complex process.Suffice to say,such is the communication between us that we experience everything in terms of how the other Sources would have experienced that location and how we would have experienced it as well. ME:How does that work then?

SE1:It is a synergetic function of being the first layer of sentience individualized from The Origin.Maybe you will discuss it with The Origin in another dialogue. You should carry on. ME:Once an energetic location that has not been experienced by another Source Entity has been found,the sentience attaches itself to the unexperienced set or body of energies associated with that location and starts to designate areas of it as self,structure,and individualizations of self.It then establishes a plan of action as to how it wants to experience that location within The Origin together with the ways in which this can be done.Having established this,it then assigns further annexing to the structure that is its new self and populates it with different variations of individualizations of its sentient energies.Sometimes it reassigns existing individualizations of sentience to experience, learn,and evolve in order to use existing experiential and evolutionary experience,and other times it creates new individualizations to gain a new and fresh context. This is the start of a new evolutionary cycle,a new mapping cycle. SE1:Yes,and for information,we are now on the third evolutionary cycle. ME:I knew that this was the third evolutionary cycle,but please explain to the readers what this means to them.I mean,how many of our TES have been through the first two evolutionary cycles? SE1:Most of those TES who were created by me to accelerate my evolutionary progression in the first evolutionary cycle are operating in this evolutionary cycle.Those that are not are still in communion with me in one of the various states of communion that are available to a TES or Aspect [see The Anne Dialogues-GSN]. ME:Why are they not involved in this evolutionary cycle? SE1:Simply because they either choose not to be or that I decided that a particular TES was either better employed in a communal state with me or would not be required in this evolutionary cycle. ME:Would they be individualized in the next evolutionary cycle? SE1:It's possible that they will be individualized and others that are in this evolutionary cycle will not be.This is always the case and will always be the case. ME:So there are or will be times when a TES is either in an evolutionary cycle or in communion with you. SE1:That's right.There are also times when a TES elects to be in,or is placed in,a position of being in service. ME:Just like those entities that are the Curators in this evolutionary cycle. SE1:Correct. ME:What happens when we have mapped out all of The Origin's area or volume of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness?How many evolutionary cycles will this take?

SE1:When all of the area or volume of The Origin's polyomniscient sentient self-awareness is mapped out the twelve Source Entities become a higher function within the next level of structure within The Origin,and the process of mapping,experiencing,learning,and evolving continues at this higher level. ME:What happens to the TES that each Source Entity creates? SE1:All of my TES will become Source Entities at my current level of evolutionary capability in their own right.The other Source Entities are expected to make similar responses,but they don't have to and may choose not to.It's up to them.The benefit of making all entities or beings that were created or have evolved into Source Entities is that it allows a higher level of interaction and depth of experience with the next level of The Origin's structure.There is no robust number of cycles left to experience that I can give you. However,to say that there is over one thousand million would be a ballpark figure. ME:Just how big is this next level of The Origin's structure? SE1:According to SE12,it follows the same progression as the current structure that The Origin's polyomniscient area of sentient self-awareness portrays.There are twelve new levels of structure with each level expanding in volume and finitude by a function of the power of twelve for every step upward and outward. ME:That's an unfathomable difference each time a level of structure is explored and experienced then.

SE1:Yes,it is.And now you can see why every individualized TES in my energies will be elevated to the position of Source Entity and therefore be creating their own TES when this series of evolutionary cycles is complete. ME:And when every Source Entity has also completed their cycles as well. SE1:Yes. The reader who is interested in this subject may benefit from reading The Origin Speaks where additional information is available. ME:Shall we continue with the Recorders? SE1:Yes.To go over the start again,the Recorders are those functions of my memory that are individualized to correctly record the work of the Curators in this particular evolutionary cycle.They can see what happened,what happens,and what will happen as a result of the work of all of the genres of Curator. ME:Is this a linear function or does it also include all of the parallel choices as well? SE1:Everything is recorded irrespective of the effects of Event Space and certain Curators' abilities to manipulate Event Space,and this is the point. The Curators work on the maintenance of the environment used by those entities and beings that are in the evolutionary cycle,and the Recorders remember and store what they do to achieve this maintenance.This information is separated out from my standard memory function,including those other individualized memory functions of the different methods of experiencing the lower frequencies through incarnation,the human version being the Akashic.They are used to guide the Curators'decision processes in the remaining events in this evolutionary cycle and those entities or beings that will be Curators in the next evolutionary cycle. ME:Bearing in mind that everything that has happened,is happening,or will happen is happening all at the same time,so to speak,how does this provide a benefit to the Curators? I mean,they are outside of linearity. SE1:This is true but even Curators can have a tendency to go over old ground,so to speak. The objective of having a memory of what they have done in all of the circumstances that they have,are,and will be involved with is to streamline the overall functions of their work and the evolutionary cycle. ME:I have been told a number of times in my readings with clients that this is the third cycle as well and more importantly,that this cycle is faster than the previous cycles.Is the use of the information that the Recorders maintain a reason why the cycles are going faster and faster? SE1:Yes.The second cycle was faster than the first,and the third is faster than the second.One of the things that you will notice,and you have also picked this up in your appointments with your reading clients,is that we have only just started the third cycle and there are already entities that have reentered into communion with me.

ME:Yes,I noticed that. SE1:Well,you will also notice that this is fast in comparison to the previous cycles. ME:Just how fast? SE1:This cycle has reached the same position in entity evolutionary progression as was experienced in the second cycle in approximately 18 percent of the time it took the second cycle and less than 1 percent of the time it took in the first cycle. ME:So we are evolving fast! SE1:Relatively speaking,yes.But it will have to be much faster to allow us to map out and experience all of The Origin's polyomniscient area or volume of sentient self-awareness and expand into its next level of structure.Note,though,that the more experienced in exploring the structure of The Origin,the faster the evolutionary cycles progress.At some point,therefore,an evolutionary cycle will be completed in the blink of a human eye. ME:So the work of the Recorders is essentially to make sure that the Curators don't go over old ground in every new evolutionary cycle then? SE1:If you want to think of it in that way,you can.You see,as each evolutionary cycle is invoked,there is a level of crossover between the previous evolutionary cycle and the new evolutionary cycle.If the Curators for the new evolutionary cycle are able to see what the previous Curators achieved,then they can create a level of sustainable acceleration in the progression of the new cycle in comparison to the previous evolutionary cycle by not going over old ground or making improved decisions in similar conditions or circumstances. ME:The end result being why the cycles are going faster and faster. SE1:That's correct. ME:I have another question before we move on to the next Curator. SE1:Go ahead. ME:Does The Origin benefit from the work of the Recorders? SE1:The Origin benefits from everything that all its creations work on or experience, irrespective of if it is one of its Source Entities,a Source Entity's TES,a TES Aspect,or an Aspect's Shard.The Recorders are my creation designed to ensure that I benefit from my retention of experience.They focus on the quality of retention of the experience and as such the recordings they make could be of interest to The Origin if it were to focus on their work.However,The Origin experiences everything that happens within me and my environments automatically and so would have no need to focus upon the work of my Recorders per se because in essence,they are part of The Origin's memory retention by default. ME:You mentioned that the Recorders ensure that you benefit from your retention of experience.Can you elaborate on what this retention of benefit of experience is?

SE1:Simply put,they are there to ensure that every experience that I have via my creations is not just recorded and forgotten about.It is not lost.Just think about what you all experience. When you experience or learn from an experience or item of education,you are knowledgeable to a certain extent about what you are experiencing and what you are learning from that experience.That information is in the forefront of your memory and, to some extent,it overshadows those experiences that you have had before,and so the memories and learning associated with those experiences become less and less prominent and distinguishable.The skill set that you gained from such experiences will still be there but your ability to access and use them will be reduced in efficiency the longer the period that they are not used for.Just think about when you learn a language.When you are immersed in that language,you pick up new words,grammar,and sentence construction concepts quickly and so you become fluent.When you don't use that language for some time,you start to lose some of those words,grammar,and sentence construction concepts and struggle during the first days of reusing the language again. If you never use it again,it will move further and further away from the forefront of your memory and become more and more difficult to access without some time or even retraining. An alternative way of looking at this is when you experience being in a new location on holiday.You remember what you did and where you did it when you return home,but with the passage of time(events),you move the focus of your memory on to other things and the memories associated with the holiday move into the background.It is only when you have a reminder given to you by a person who was with you or the presentation of a photograph that the memories of that holiday start to come back into the forefront of your memory.Even then,though,not all of the memories come back because it is usually only those that are associated with the photograph that are invoked.In effect,you lack the ability to have immediate experiential memory recall due to focusing on experiences that need your present attention,unless you are using a previously gained memory or skill set in the present. This immediate retention of experiential memory is a problem with all entities, irrespective of their omniscience,simply because we are all in the current moment,so to speak. ME:That's all very well,but you are supposed to be omniscient and omnipresent and as such have instantly available recall of every experience that you and your entities have had, are having,and will have! SE1:Omnipresence just means that an entity is everything and everything is it-within the confines of its sentient energies,that is.Omniscience means that the sentience associated with that entity is located within all of the energies that make up that entity.It is the focus of that sentience that creates the attention of the entity to the detail associated with the localized sentient energies and that which they have experienced. ME:So omniscience is just a name to describe the total distribution of the sentience within a body of energies then? SE1:Correct. ME:And omnipresence is just a name to describe that everything associated with a particular body of sentient energy is associated with a single entity,that entity therefore being omnipresent within its own body of energy. SE1:Correct. ME:And if all of the energy associated with that entity is sentient energy,then that entity is therefore omniscient within its own body of energies. SE1:Now you are getting it. ME:Isn't that limited,though?I mean,incarnate humans truly believe that God,you,and The Origin are accessing all experiences in all locations at once and are therefore retaining everything with the ability to have instant access of experience and evolution because everything is happening in the now.Nothing is forgotten in God's mind because everything is in the present;everything is still being experienced. SE1:And that is true from your incarnate perspective because you have extremely limited functionality while being incarnate,and you are within the body of sentient energies that are mine so everything would appear to operate in the way described by incarnate mankind.I will explain how it is achieved.First you have to realize that sentience has an epicenter,a focus of active function that is the main area of activity of that sentience.

This epicenter creates the state of beingness that generates the personality behind the sentience.It is this beingness,the personality,that is the essence of the sentience and therefore the entity or being itself.It is the ability of the desire of this beingness to move around the rest of its sentient energies in an instant that creates the ability to appear to be in the omnipresent omniscient state that you incarnate humans expect your creator to be in.This is how The Origin,the other Source Entities,and I work.This is how we have omnipresent omniscience.This also describes how your True Energetic Self functions and how all True Energetic Selves function. ME:And this includes the TES created by the other Source Entities? SE1:In general,yes.I say in general because not all Source Entities have created what you would recognize as entities in the genre of my TES creations. ME:So how is this instant access of experience that maintains the benefit of recent experience achieved? SE1:The Recorders create a condition where every experience is located in a tract of sentient energy that is always associated with the epicenter of the sentience,the state of beingness of the entity.This tract of sentient energy is specialized in the ability to retain experiential memory and continuously present it to the sentience,the state of beingness that is the entity,in a way that creates the appearance that it is always happening in the moment,so to speak. This creates the instant accessibility of the memory,its experiential content,the learning associated with it as well as the evolutionary content associated with it.All of this together creates the continuous benefit of the experience to the entity and its fluidity of the use of such experiences when required. ME:So what you are saying is-it's like everything that is experienced,was experienced, will be experienced is experienced-as if it is just being experienced because it is always with the focus of the sentience. SE1:That's a lot of experiences,but,yes,that's a reasonable description of what I experience!There is more to this,though. ME:Go on? SE1:I don't just experience these things as if they are being experienced in the now,I also experience the experiences in terms of the learning and evolutionary content that associated with the experience as well. ME:So you have at the forefront of the focus of your sentience,the benefit of the depth of the experience.You also have that understanding about an experience which we achieve only after the experience.This takes place when we reflect on that experience,compare and contrast that experience with similar or same experiences,and probably reexperience as well? SE1:That's correct.This is why the work of the Recorders is important.It is not just because they assign experiential memories to specific components of my energies,they also record and present to my focus of sentience all of the benefits associated with those experiential memories. ME:But isn't having all this information in the forefront of your sentient focus a distraction? SE1:No. ME:Why? SE1:Because I have the capacity to cope with every experience and its benefits that every entity I created experiences,and this includes those variants created by the invocation of Event Space. ME:So where is all this information stored then?Just where is your sentient focus? SE1:It's in the rest of me,the other half of me that is not used in the creation of my multiversal environments and my creations. ME:But I thought that you told me that the side of you,that is still you and not individualized,was for your own investigations of self and other work. SE1:It is.I have many things that I am working on.However,the focus of my sentience is not with my multiversal environment and the entities that I created to populate it,this is what I created all of you for.One doesn't have a dog and bark oneself,does one?

ME:I guess not. SE1:I do,however,have some small part of my sentience focused on you and a few others right now. ME:Where is the focus of your sentience then? SE1:My main focus of sentience is located in that part of me that is still me.Some part of that sentience is the link to the recordings that the Recorders have created for me so that I can experience everything that you are all experiencing,in whatever Event Space that is concurrently and with the benefit of experience associated with it. ME:So you are constantly with us all then,even if it is in an observational position in a location that is outside of the multiversal environment you created for us to evolve through. SE1:Correct. ME:Well,I am pleased to understand how this all works with the Recorders and now think that we can move on to the next genre of Curator:the Interfacers. SE1:I agree;let's go.

## The Interfacers 

ME:Shall I start? SE1:By all means. ME:The Interfacers are a group of entities that link everything together.They see and engineer myriad ways in which to interconnect the work of one set of entities to the work of another set of entities.This can also be from one entity to another as well.It is not restricted to groups. SE1:That is a good summary.I will continue. It could be argued,however,that the work of the Interfacers is not required because all entities have the ability to experience all things simultaneously and therefore understand the functionality surrounding the potential to link one piece of work with another.Having said that,though,when considering the complexities surrounding the maintenance of any part of my multiverse and those parallel environments that could,can,and will be created, there is a genuine need for entities to specialize.Understanding the opportunities,ways, and methods of linking the work of other entities together is therefore complicated at best, and requires some significant focus to ensure there is a seamless level of integration. ME:So what you are saying here then is that the Interfacers create an image out of a series of smaller images.
