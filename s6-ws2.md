### Foreword 

Welcome to The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 2 - Questions and Channeled Answers on the Greater Reality. 

If, dear reader you read The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 1 - Lectures on the Greater Reality, then this foreword is just to remind you of how these books came to be. If, however, this is the first book in the World Satsanga series you are reading, then the foreword below will explain how it all materialised. 

Enjoy!

~ ~ ~ 
 
When The History of God was first published, a reader contacted me and expressed an interest in a dialogue. This dialogue continued for some time and resulted in two things. One; a monthly meeting where my readers, or people of like mind, could gain answers to questions not answered in The History of God. And two; me travelling to New Mexico in 2012 and holding a Traversing the Frequencies (TTF) workshop. I was subsequently invited back over the next couple of years and enjoyed the interest in the greater reality. It was at one of these workshops that I met a remarkable lady who was later to become a spiritual/ metaphysical influence in her own right. Her name was Ulla Sarmiento. 

The monthly meeting was to be called the “World Satsanga” and it was broadcast live on Skype. We enjoyed between 12 to 25 (the max Skype would allow) attendees each month. The format was that I would give a lecture, we would then have questions and answers, followed by an end of meeting meditation. The answers to the questions were channelled “on the spot” by me. The Satsanga would be recorded and the recording would be available via email to the attendees or those interested. It would also be blogged via my website. Ulla was a regular attendee. 

Satsanga is a Sanskrit term derived from two roots: sat meaning "true” and sangha meaning “community, company or association.” There are many other interpretations such as Satsang or Satsanga being an audience with a Satguru (religious or spiritual teacher) for religious instruction. It may also refer to other spiritual movements originating in India. However, the feeling of “being together in the truth” is the one that resonates with me the most. World Satsanga therefore means a “a world together in the truth” in my mind. 

The World Satsanga has changed over the years, including being pre-recorded with the questions and answers being emailed to me prior to transmission. However, more recently it has stabilised to being a pre-recorded lecture and meditation with the questions and answers being broadcast live via Zoom. The final recording being everything edited together as one file and broadcast on YouTube. 

During 2016 Ulla announced that she transcribed the Satsangas for her own reference, asking me if I would like to transmit the transcriptions on a monthly basis together with the video/ audio files. We both thought it would be perfect for those with hearing difficulties or were not so “connected” to the internet, whose connected friends could print them off and distribute them. We felt this was a perfect solution and the transcriptions flowed each month. 

Transcription is hard work by the way! 

Over the years I would get the odd nudge from attendees or readers/ listeners of the World Satsanga broadcasts suggesting that it would be nice to have a book written on some of the subjects broached. Yes, I would say and then completely forget about it as I was too engrossed in writing my latest book. However, this possibility, or Event Space, was not to go away. 

In 2021 the World Satsanga was ten years old and Ulla emailed me to say that she was seeing the same questions being asked and the answers being repeated. Prior to this if the same questions were asked new information would be channelled by me. With the change in format to be introduced in January 2022 back to live video questions and answers we therefore decided to call a close to the transcriptions, because they were still available on my website for those who wanted to read them. 

It was late 2021 that inspiration, or Event Space, suddenly came into focus. YES! We should make a book out of the lectures, questions and answers arising from the Satsangas. Now was the time. I quickly emailed Ulla who instantly agreed it was a good idea. However, she had only transcribed the Satsangas from 2016 onwards! Did I have the earlier recordings? I noted that in saving space on my website, some of the earlier recordings were deleted, so I was suddenly worried. Luckily though, I had archived them and we had a complete set. 

In the meantime Ulla had moved house and country! And needed to work on her own publications and website before commencing the unbelievable amount of work transcribing the earlier recordings and starting to compile the text. When Ulla became available we decided that it was best to work on the questions and answers first and see how large that task was before looking at the lectures. As it happened the questions and answers needed two “large” books. This book on the lectures was a fast follower but with heavy editing, mainly due to repetition of lecture subject matter over the years, we thought would fit into a single book. 

Even though the questions and answers books were finished first we decided that, as with the format of the World Satsanga, the lectures should come first with the questions and answers coming second and third, hence this being book one! 

The book on lectures is compiled in “alphabetically organised subject order” with the material for each subject together in the same section for ease of indexing and reading. Please note that if additional or new material was broadcast from lectures of the same subject matter then that was included to make it one lecture. 

The same compilation strategy is used for the questions & answers books, with this book - Q& A book 1 (World Satsanga Book 2) hosting questions and answers from A-M. 

Without doubt this first World Satsanga, and subsequent books, would not have materialised without the help, interest, motivation, intuition, dedication, encouragement, friendship and VERY HARD WORK of Ulla Sarmiento. 

Indeed, this particular Event Space would not exist without her! Something to think about dear reader! THANK YOU ULLA FOR BEING HERE ON THIS PLANET AT THIS POINT IN MY EXISTENCE Guy Steven Needler 4th December 2022

### 前言

### Abortion and Miscarriage 

The human being is made of two parts— a soul and a body. Think of the body as a vehicle, like a car, which needs a driver, which is the soul. When the body dies, the soul leaves the car behind. The soul goes back to its True Energetic Self (Higher Self/ Oversoul/ Godhead/“ Home”), which is where it came from. The soul is eternal, so it can never be harmed or destroyed by others. 

**When does the soul permanently enter the body?** 

Before conception there is work on a life plan by the incoming soul and the potential parents. But the soul doesn’t permanently enter the body at conception or at the embryonal or fetal state or even in the birth state. The soul can move in and out of that body up until the age of 4 years and then starts to become more and more attached and connected to the body. 

It’s around the age of 7 years that the soul is fully integrated with the vehicle that it’s going to use for its incarnate experience. This description is in my book, The Anne Dialogues. It’s about the integration of the soul and the human fetus (4/ 2016). 

**What is the spiritual perspective on Birth control?** 

If there is birth control involved, then that’s understood by the soul. Think of things in a more holistic way, in a more holographic way. The souls know that a potential father or parent is going to have an abortion or birth control, so the birth control doesn’t come into it as such. That’s a linear function. The souls work with that which is going to be. They know what’s going to happen. 

Everything has happened already anyway. Everything is happening. Everything will happen and it’s happening now or concurrently, so everything is understood. As a result of that, they take upon themselves to enter the physical vehicles that are going to be successfully created. So the birth control side doesn’t come into it at all (4/ 2016). 

**What is the spiritual perspective on Abortion? Is it pre-planned by the mother’s soul or the incoming baby’s soul? Is it just the physical vehicle that is aborted?**

It’s usually an agreement between the soul that’s in the mother’s body and the incoming soul that only wants to experience connecting to the fetal form. The abortion is one way of terminating that incarnation at an early exit point or termination juncture, so that the soul can leave and move back into the energetic side. Usually, it’s about experiencing the connectivity between two souls from the start of the process of creating a new human vehicle. The incoming soul only needs to experience a small part of the gestation period. The abortion is understood and recognized on a subconscious level as an early termination juncture that the mother uses to help the soul within the fetus move to back into the energetic (8/ 2018). 

**How does Abortion sit with the Source? How does it affect the woman’s life path? Do some women choose to experience that or is it the baby’s soul choice?** 

You have to look at a higher perspective. It’s about experience. The individual mother might want to experience the gestation of another form or incarnate vehicle within it for a certain period of time and then no longer want to experience that as part of its incarnation. Similarly, the incoming soul may wish to be associated with being part of the gestation of an incarnate vehicle up to a certain point and then detach from it (11/ 2018). 

**Is it counted as Karma?**

It’s usually part of a plan, an experiential plan that the aspect associated with the mother and potentially the father and potentially the child in its embryonic state wanted to experience in different ways. They all wanted to experience different aspects of that and then move on. 

We don’t all want to experience a whole life. We don’t want to experience being born. We sometimes want to experience the condition of connectivity with the form, which could be born, for instance. We’ve got various different things here, which are sometimes abhorrent to the human condition, but actually very benign to us when we’re in the energetic (11/ 2018). 

**If the embryo/ fetus is a matter-based vehicle (made of Anu particles) used by the soul, then who creates the body during gestation? Is it the mother’s body in utero or a joint effort by the mother and the soul after the soul starts to integrate with the vehicle?** 

The fundamental particle of matter called the Anu is the basic building block of the gross physical plane. It’s six levels below the atom. There’s two things happening here. One is the animal-based creation of a form and the other is the energetic-based creation of that form. We have the mother through the partnership with the father getting together to create the possibility for a smaller form to be created. 

But the energies associated with that need to be supported by the soul, which is a smaller aspect of the True Energetic Self. The soul’s guide and helpers ensure at conception that the embryo has a basic energy system and a basic set of chakras, so the energy is there and it can start growing. Without that energy system in place, the embryo can’t grow, it’ll just die early (e.g. abortion, miscarriage). 

We have two things happening here. We have the physical growth of a fetus and we have the energy system associated with that, which the guide and helpers and the soul create and align to that fetus right at the very start at conception, so that the energy is there. Without that, it can’t grow, it’ll just die early— what we call an aborted birth or those sorts of things. 

So when the fetus doesn’t grow or it is miscarried, it’s usually because the energy associated with the body that the soul would use either hasn’t been placed there or it has been removed, so that that fetus can’t possibly grow into a useable vehicle for experiencing, learning and evolving in this particular low frequency environment (6/ 2017). 

**Does the soul create the vehicle as a construct of Anu particles or just as a projection of light from thoughts. The Pleiadians (channeled by Wendy Kennedy) said:**

“As a 3D being, in order to experience physical reality, you focus your energy as a soul— you intensify the beam of light, if you will, your consciousness so densely that it creates dense physical matter— you create a body for yourself.”— Wendy Kennedy (“ The Great Human Potential”) 

**Is that how the mechanics of incarnation happens?** 

First to clarify, we’re not really “three-dimensional beings.” Our soul has incarnated into a human form, which is a vehicle that exists in the gross physical plane created from the first three frequency bands (FB 1-3) in our universe. That makes us a “three frequential” incarnate entity. But the human form is highly sophisticated and exists on higher planes called the astral or spirituo-physical plane (at FB 4-7) and the purely energetic plane (at FB 8-10) as well. Two things happen. The fetus grows within the mother after procreation by the mother and the father. At the same time, the soul inserts the energy system into the body with the help of its guide and helpers. 

Wendy Kennedy is summarizing the energy that’s associated to the fetus. It’s not quite accurate, but it’s close enough. It only deals with one thing. We do create the body, but we also create the energy system associated with the body. The way she said, “You create the body for yourself” is sort of right and sort of wrong, because we don’t create the body. The gross physical body is created for us as a result of procreation by the mother and father. But our soul with its guide and helpers insert an energy system into that physical body (with the chakras and energetic network at FB 1-10). Without that energy system in place, the fetus won’t grow. 

It’s not quite deep enough in understanding when stating you intensify the beam of light, which is focusing the energy of your soul, your sentience (“ consciousness”) so densely that it creates dense physical matter. We don’t actually create dense physical matter, it’s too difficult for us. We assist in the animation of the dense physical matter (body). 

We create the interface, if you like, between the dense physical matter and the soul, so that the soul can interface with it. That’s what we do, we create the interface. If you want to think of it in terms of creating the body, you can do, but it’s a bit confusing and not correct. We create the interface that allows the soul to be inserted and connected to the gross physical. The gross physical can’t exist without that interface, so those two things go together (6/ 2017). 

**Is the Zika virus infection manmade or a spontaneous epidemic?** 

The Zika virus is in effect “manmade,” but not in terms of being made in the laboratory. It’s a function of our remaining in a lower frequential state— meaning anything that can put us into a lower frequential state, whether it’s fear, materialism or the need to have certain levels of status, etc. As a result of that, an existing virus may mutate into a state where it can infect the human body. It’s a function of our frequential condition that is allowing that mutation of existing viruses to take control (4/ 2016). 

**There are 2.2 billion people at risk?** 

Yes, that gives you an idea of how many individuals are potentially at the wrong frequential state that allows something to be created that resets the clock, so to speak. If you think about some of the worldwide issues we’ve had, like black death, HIV and these type of things, it’s a function of where there is a need to reset the clock or start again. That means a lot of us in the incarnate state leave the planet. This is how these different viruses come into being (4/ 2016). 

**What is Source’s position on Aåbortion, if the mother is infected?** 

The loss of any vehicle is a tragedy, because every vehicle that can come into fruition as a human body is the opportunity for a soul to experience incarnation and to learn and evolve as a result of that irrespective of whether there is a defect or not. If there is a defect, the soul grows faster than if there isn’t a defect, so any body that is aborted is potentially difficult (4/ 2016). 

**What if the mother’s life is in danger?** 

Yes, because the mother’s life might be taken out of danger. It could well be that the soul that’s existing in the mother’s body has decided to experience that level of danger, to allow another soul to experience incarnation as well. It’s a very human thought process to think about, “Oh, if the baby’s got cancer or Zika or HIV, it could potentially infect the mother, if the mother is not infected.” She could be a carrier, so they’d take out the baby and abort it. 

On the other side, it could be the mother is infected and the baby is okay. She’s had the baby out and the mother could die. It’s all to do with the experience of the soul, not the thought process that the human being should try to perpetuate the human body for as long as possible. If it’s part of the life plan that the soul within the mother’s body is expecting to experience the disease as part of their experiential and evolutionary progression, then they will do that irrespective of what’s going on around them (4/ 2016). 

**What happens in Miscarriage in terms of parallels? Does that happen only in some parallel lives (e.g. 50% of them) and not in other parallels? Or does it vary from case to case?** 

When there has not been an incarnation, because the aspect wanted to experience just being part of the joining of the mother with the fetus, then my understanding is that there’s no parallel conditions elsewhere. The only parallel condition would be with the mother (9/ 2018). 

**If the baby soul decides to leave through miscarriage in one parallel, what happens when that woman gets pregnant again?** 

The woman is the incarnate entity that is in different parallel conditions, so that individual would arguably not get pregnant with that particular soul who created the miscarriage in the rest of the parallel incarnations. 

There is some logic to this. The logical mind says, it makes sense that potentially you experience a miscarriage in one parallel condition but not in another one. But it’s all to do with the intention or the desire of the entity that is in the fetus, whether that soul wants to incarnate or not. 

If it wants to experience multiple parallel conditions— where in one parallel stream it is incarnate, and in another one it’s not or in another one it’s stillborn or it died after three days of being incarnate— then that may well be experienced. There may well be different experiences of pregnancy that the woman may experience. But generally, unless there’s been an agreement with the soul that is being incarnated in that mother to do those sorts of things, then generally the mother is only pregnant in one particular reality (9/ 2018). 

**Can the same baby’s soul return to the same woman in another parallel scenario downstream from the miscarriage scenario?** 

Yes, it can, if it has decided to be in different levels of incarnate relationships with that woman in different parallel conditions. But if it hasn’t decided to do that, then it won’t do it. It’s just as I’ve explained it in the last part (9/ 2018). 

**Or is that soul now committed to existing in the earlier parallels where the woman carried the fetus to term in the first place?** 

Again, it depends upon whether the agreement between the incarnate individual who is the mother and the incarnate individual who is the baby. Usually, it’s about the incarnate individual who is the baby, who wants to either experience just one level of function of being incarnate or multiple different functions of being incarnate associated to them. So again it could decide that it only wants to experience a fetus growing for three months and then the miscarriage happens. 

Or it might want to experience all of those different things, and therefore, incur the different parallel conditions where it could experience going through full term, being born and dying three days later, for instance. It could be born and go to full adulthood. It could be dying at birth. It could be a whole bunch of different things, if it wishes to do so as well. 

So it’s really up to the soul as to how it wants to experience it and invoke those different parallel opportunities as well. In terms of life plans, it can also work on those as well— meaning work on understanding the different parallel conditions as well (9/ 2018). 

**Can that baby soul “loop” back into the same woman to share another set of parallel lives with her, if she feels strongly connected to that particular baby soul?**

Well, just say soul or aspect rather than “baby soul,” but I understand what’s being said there. It wouldn’t specifically be looped back. It could go back, but that creates the parallel condition. So it’s not a case of looping back, it’s a case of working with the parallels rather than looping back. Then again that would be a particular relationship that’s been set up for this particular series of incarnations or not, as the case may be, with the entity that’s incarnating as the baby and the entity that’s being incarnated as the mother (9/ 2018). 

**If so, the logistics of these parallel lives is really mind blowing, because we don’t see any of the "event space maneuvering" going on behind the scenes?** 

Yes, when I was looking at all the different fractals, as I was trying to answer these questions, it was just unbelievably huge, because we don’t see any of the event space maneuvering going on behind the scenes. We don’t understand in any way, shape or form the amount of work that goes on in the background and all the things that we normally understand as well (9/ 2018).

### 堕胎和流产

### Addiction 

**Is there “karma rehab” in the energetic, perhaps to dissipate addictions?** 

The answer is yes, there is a certain level of rehabilitation there. When we are addicted to drugs, for instance, those drugs affect the soul or aspect energetically in a detrimental way. Those individuals whose physical body demises or they ascend early through the taking of drugs or in alcoholic conditions have to go through a certain level of rehabilitation, because that addiction is karma. It’s addiction to the physical and it’s a function of sensation-based karma. 

Karma is attraction to anything that’s low frequency while we’re incarnate. They can undergo a level of rehabilitation, where the energetic damage is resolved or balanced out, so the energetic damage done to them by taking drugs or alcoholic overdose or anything like that is balanced out by other disincarnate entities that are aspects from other True Energetic Selves that specialize in removing the energies associated with the death in a certain way (7/ 2014). 

**What are the effects of taking marijuana or alcohol?** 

Although marijuana isn’t specifically the strongest thing, like LSD or crystal meth or ecstasy or other drugs that are out there, we do get a partial decoupling from the physical vehicle, and therefore, hallucinations or more lucid moments can also be experienced as well. But it’s disharmonious for the soul, because the physical form is being poisoned, so the soul has to try to get out. With things like marijuana or other low grade drugs, the soul can’t totally get out. 

It’s the same with alcohol. Sometimes people have more lucid moments having alcohol, more thought processes that are more in keeping with clairsentience than they would do, if they were totally sober, so it’s the same thing. It’s a limited level of decoupling there rather than a total decoupling, so the soul doesn’t get totally ejected from the energies associated with the gross physical and the spirituophysical parts in the vehicle. 

In essence, any form of drug in all ways, shapes and forms isn’t good for us, not specifically from the physical perspective, but also from the energetic perspective and from the soul level. Any toxins that are in foods that can be addictive or anything associated with a synthesized or even a natural drug, if it’s used incorrectly, would affect us definitely. 

We are supposed to be self-contained and self-maintained. That means we can heal ourselves and continue our existence as long as possible. But we’ve lost that ability to be self-contained and self-maintained, so we’ve started to rely on external activities and maintenance rather than doing it ourselves. We’ve relied on a doctor or an apothecary or a wisened person to help us heal our physical form rather than healing it ourselves. 

That’s a direct result of us moving down the frequencies in the past. We don’t need to eat anywhere near what we eat, we only need to eat enough. If we really do start to train ourselves properly, we can take energy through the chakras and the physical form would be maintained via energy through the chakras, and therefore, the need for gross physical food would be negated (1/ 2015). 

**In The Anne Dialogues she said sedatives lower our frequency and make it harder for the soul to leave the physical body. What about hospice or end-of-life car with various drugs?** 

All of those things do affect our ability to leave. The drug lowers the frequency of the soul and attacks it by stopping it from being higher frequency. Each of these drugs affect our physicality and our energies in a different way depending upon who and what we are. Therefore, one particular drug may affect one of us more than another person, because one person might be naturally resistant to it energetically and chemically, so it’s a bit of a mixed bag (1/ 2015). 

**Do our souls react differently to different classes of drugs, such as CNS depressants (alcohol, Prozac), CNS stimulants (cocaine, meth), dissociative anesthetics (ketamine, PCP), hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca) or inhalants (anesthetics)?** 

All these things— they do the same thing. They’re all a mechanical way of achieving a greater level of connectivity, but they do it by throwing the soul out of the body. Inhalants used for surgery do the same thing. They all can react in different ways and each of us will react differently to the same drug and even the same dose of the drug. One of us might be naturally resistant to the drug’s effects. It just depends upon what our level of natural resistance is both energetically and physically in that respect (1/ 2015). 

**I’ve read that lower frequency beings just get sucked back into Source, but as we raise our frequency, our signature aspect (soul) gains substance?** 

If it is lower frequency beings, I’d classify those as astral entities rather than souls or aspects of a True Energetic Self (TES) that have been projected into an environment to experience, learn and evolve. The astral entities are low frequency entities made of energy that through either luck or longevity has started to evolve its own minor intelligence. If they start to abuse individual souls who incarnate for evolutionary purposes by hanging onto them and taking their energy— which happens a lot— then a healer can see them and remove them from that individual and send them back to Source to be recycled. 

In terms of low frequency incarnate individuals, if a soul has accrued a significant amount of attractivity to lower frequencies by being attracted to drugs or alcohol, then after death their soul will go into a “quarantine” first, where those addictions are erased from them before they can recommune with their TES. 

The TES will not accept back into itself an aspect that is overloaded with low frequency attractivity. It tolerates normal karma, because the end game of that is a significant leap in its own evolution. But being attracted to low frequencies and becoming a very low frequency aspect means that the soul is quarantined and “cleansed and educated,” so that it can recommune with its TES later (2/ 2015). 

**Quarantine sounds like purgatory?** 

It’s not so much purgatory as it’s more of a way of cleansing that part of the aspect or the soul. It’s a little bit like having worked on an oily and greasy motor car and then not putting your best clothes on. You clean those hands until they’re spotlessly cleaned, then you put your nice clothes on. It’s a little bit like that, so think of it in that way (2/ 2015). 

**What is the reason behind the opioid epidemic or crisis in the United States? Opioids are prescribed as pain killers for chronic pain. About 100 people die of opioid overdoses per day, more than deaths from gun violence. Is it to do with our overall frequencies still going down? Or is addiction something that some souls wanted to experience and then recover from? Or is it profiteering by big pharmaceutical companies and the medical community? All of the above and more?** 

Yes, it’s all of the above basically. It’s a whole bunch of things. It’s a thought process where we want to get a quick fix. We don’t want to go through the process of fixing ourselves or working on ourselves and our thought processes to be able to remove that which is causing us pain by allowing ourselves to detach from pain, detaching ourselves from the physical aspect of what we are. Pain can be removed simply by detaching the consciousness from the focal point of the area of pain and thinking of something else. 

For example, how many of us have been running or cycling or swimming or walking and going somewhere and then thought about something or we’ve been daydreaming and concentrating on something else. We’ve suddenly come out of the daydream or the thought process and found out that we’ve moved a long way. We do it in cars and motor bikes, which is not so good. That’s because we’re so engrossed in this other thought process that we forget our physical condition. 

Even though we might be exercising vigorously, we remove ourselves, remove our consciousness from this focal point of the pain associated with exercise or a particular issue we’ve got. We can use those sorts of methods to remove ourselves or detach ourselves when we’re in pain. We can work on healing ourselves as well. 

But in real terms, it’s to do with low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions and again laziness associated with it. Sometimes it’s experiencing addiction and not coming out of addiction. Sometimes it’s wanting to move forwards and recover from that addiction as well. 

There’s also the thought process surrounding profiteering by the big pharmaceutical companies and medical community. People in a low frequency condition start to become lazy in their thought process and their actions. Rather than wanting to work hard to do something, they want to recover from it without having to do real work. 

For instance, it’s easier for the doctor to say, “Yeah, take this pill, it will sort you out,” instead of saying, “What you need to do is this and this is a program for doing it and come back in three or four weeks and let me know how you’ve done.” That takes a lot of extra determination by the individual and a lot of time by the doctor as well. That’s why we get on the pill route. It’s a low frequency, easy, lazy way of doing things that’s associated with low frequency (10/ 2017). 

**If one has had any addiction, but he/ she recuperated from it during their incarnated life by attending AA meetings, etc., do they still have to be quarantined?**

This comes from The Anne Dialogues. The level of quarantine depends upon the level of dependency on the drugs and the level of the ability of the incarnate aspect or soul to disassociate themselves from that addiction. Sometimes the addiction is part of a piece of evolutionary progression, where we place ourselves in a difficult position and then the life plan is to remove ourselves from that difficult position or the karmic link of addiction. 

Bear in mind, we run lots of risk in terms of significant karma and contamination, if drugs are involved. If you are addicted to drugs or alcohol, it does reduce your frequencies to the point that the aspect is unable to recommune with the True Energetic Self. If the demise of the human vehicle is through drugs or alcohol, then that results in the quarantine function, where the soul has to be cleansed by the True Energetic Self before it can recommune with it (10/ 2018). 

But if they have moved away from the addiction, because they can draw upon the expertise of individuals who can guide them away from drug dependency or addiction, then they would still have to be quarantined, but not in the same level as somebody who was completely dependent and died from overdosing, for instance. Usually, there would need to be a little bit of quarantine, just to make sure that the energies associated with the low frequencies that they accrued or that stuck to them during their dependency was removed (2/ 2019). 

**In The Anne Dialogues, you said low frequency addictions are removed by going back to event spaces— is it when the desire started? Doesn’t that change the past or the parallels?** 

Once we have disincarnated and we’ve moved away from this particular incarnation, the addictions are removed, which is part of the quarantining function by going through the different event spaces. That allows a disassociation from it. It’s not a change in the past, because the past, present and future are all one. 

Having a past, having a present and having a future is a human concept. It’s a metric that mankind has created to describe something or to control something, which doesn’t really exist. Does it affect the past? No, it can’t do, because the past doesn’t exist. It’s only a series of nows. 

The ability to go back to the inception point and to remove the addiction and remove the energy associated with the addiction means that you’re just changing the use of event space to allow that to happen. So it won’t affect the past. It doesn’t affect parallel lives either, because we’re moving into an event space that is neutral to parallel lives. 

It doesn’t change the experience of the incarnate, or should I say, it doesn’t change the experience of the True Energetic Self, because it’s already recorded. The incarnate aspect is simply a means by which the True Energetic Self can experience multiple things by having parallel experiential processing. 

As long as it’s being experienced, it doesn’t matter if the addiction associated with it is removed, because it’s the experience that counts rather than whether the addiction is still there or not. It’s a very convoluted thing to understand that where we go back to change the event space, it may have already been there in the first place (10/ 2018 & 2/ 2019). 

**When a soul is disincarnate, but still has desires for low frequencies due to addiction, could this disincarnate soul avoid going to the light? Is this why this entity chooses to stay at low frequencies and becomes an entity that attaches itself to other incarnates?** 

In general, the only reason why a disincarnate soul stays around Earth is because they have become immersed in their incarnation and have an addiction to certain incarnate sensations, such as being drunk or being on drugs. They may walk-in to another person’s body temporarily, when that individual is indulging themselves in an alcoholic frenzy or becomes paralytic, so that the incumbent soul has to remove itself from the body temporarily, because the frequencies are so low and abhorrent to the soul. 

But if somebody is already disincarnate and has certain addictive desires, like experiencing alcohol, drugs, sex or various different other pastimes they used to have, it doesn’t mean that they become an astral entity, which is something different. 

The astral entity has some minor intelligence, but it is not sentient or ensouled. It is a transient entity that tries to take energies from other human beings who are incarnate. In this particular case, the soul needs help from its guide and helpers to move it back from the lower astral levels into the higher levels, so they can see the effect of their addictions and what their low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions have created for them. The guide and helpers will help that soul move on. 

Even though they may be stuck on Earth for what could be days, weeks, months, years or even centuries, they will eventually be pulled back into the higher frequency energies associated with their True Energetic Self. They will be helped to the point where they can reincarnate later, so that their addictions slowly will be removed over a period of time or even a period of lifetimes. 

As our souls progress through the process of incarnation, we get to the point eventually where we understand that certain thoughts, behaviors and actions create a link with low frequencies. Therefore, we actively choose not to have those thoughts, behaviors and actions and choose the higher frequency response. Addiction is just a slowing down of the process of evolution rather than creating an astral entity that is dependent upon the energy of another human being for its existence (10/ 2018). 

There’s never a situation where an aspect avoids forever going back into the light. Going back into the light means that they go back into the frequencies associated with the location of the True Energetic Self. Irrespective of what we do and how we do it, we will all return back to the light— that light being the ability to recommune with our True Energetic Self in one of the five or six different methods that we use to do so (2/ 2019). 

**We hear about people who die from a drug overdose. It may not be intentional but it’s not accidental either. Are their evolutionary debts the same or worse than death from suicide?** 

There is a different level of evolutionary debt associated with suicide— unless they are that very rare case where an aspect or soul is given an exemption to allow it, in which case suicide becomes part of their termination juncture to leave the incarnation they're currently in. 

Basically, the overdose is a karmic debt they have. It becomes an issue, because they need to be purified energetically and frequentially before they can reintegrate or recommune with their True Energetic Self. But they also have a very big level of karma associated with the addiction and the attractivity to a physical stimulus, which drugs are. They don't get an evolutionary debt per se, but they do get a significant amount of karma that they've got to overcome (1/ 2021).

### ADD/ ADHD 

Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are a function of a higher frequency incarnation. These people are here to help raise the overall frequency of the human population and the planet itself. 

**Would you please tell us more about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?** 

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is something that happens with people who are autistic or people who are higher frequency and struggling to communicate properly with the rest of us. They are broadcasting on various different frequencies and expecting certain levels of communication, but they are not receiving communication back, so they get frustrated. 

For instance, if we communicate on one level of communication, such as the verbal response and they’re communicating on emotional, telepathic and other frequential methods and they’re not getting answers back, they get frustrated. That’s why there’s a hyperactivity disorder or an attention deficit disorder, because they can’t see the point in communicating with us or doing something when we’re not listening to them. That’s why they get frustrated (9/ 2017). 

**In an interview with Julia Cannon in 2015, you said they are advanced beings, like the indigo, crystal, rainbow children or hybrids of those types.** 

They can be higher frequency individuals. They’re advanced beings, like the indigo, crystal, rainbow children or hybrids of those types. Again they do get frustrated, because they’re communicating on like twelve channels, where we’re only communicating on one. The information that we give back isn’t the information that they expect back, so it’s very difficult. 

It’s a bit like us saying something in English and somebody else is communicating with us in Chinese. It doesn’t work, does it? We get frustrated, because we can’t make ourselves known. The person on the other side doesn’t understand what we’re saying either. This is another way of thinking about it (9/ 2017). 

**ADHD tends to run in families and continues into adulthood in half the cases as a sense of being overwhelmed, having no filters and always being on edge?** 

Yes, that’s because they’re communicating and some people communicate with them, but on a different level. Sometimes they pick up lots of other bits and pieces that the other ones pick up as well. Their senses are all open and they’re not getting the information coming through from the people they think should be able to communicate with them, but they are sometimes getting it through from other people who they maybe don’t want to know (9/ 2017). 

**What about the possibility of Bipolar disorder coexisting with ADHD?** 

Bipolar disorder is the possibility of having two souls in the same body where are one soul is sometimes animating the body and sometimes it’s not. It is quite possible to have both of these conditions together, if they’re both quite high frequency souls. 

When either of them is in control of the body or animating the body, then they both would expect to have communication that’s not coming to them. They can see people that they’re interacting with and broadcasting to, but those people are ignoring them in their mind. ADHD can also exist with individuals who are bipolar where they have the potential for two souls to be in the same body (9/ 2017). 

**Most adults with ADHD don't just have ADHD— 75% to 80% have other disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, substance abuse?** 

The substance abuse and other abuses is because they are trying to get out of the body basically. They’ve had enough or they’re trying to dumb down their own communicative senses. They’re trying to turn off certain communicative methods, so they can operate like us. That’s why they sometimes do substance abuse, smoke or take alcohol, for instance. The depression and anxiety is because they’re not being heard. 

Bipolar is a separate function, but you can be both, if you’ve got two souls who are higher frequency and are communicating on many different channels to us, but we’re not responding back. They will become depressed, because they feel they are being ignored. They get anxious, because they feel they are being ignored and can’t do anything right, because they can’t get the information back in the way that they’re expecting it. 

The bipolar bit is simply that there’s two souls doing a similar sort of thing and both have got control of the body. It’s almost like having many personalities, the same sort of thing. It’s just that the one is more depressed or sad vs. one is more joyful (9/ 2017). 

**What’s the best approach to treatment (e.g. medications, psychotherapy, behavior modification) or coping with life?** 

Basically, the best approach to treatment is to put them with like types of individuals. People who are experiencing this should stay together, because they will be able to communicate with each other properly. A person speaking English will be able to speak English. 

A person speaking Chinese will have to speak Chinese. A person speaking or communicating on twelve different frequency levels will be able to communicate with somebody on twelve different frequency levels. This is the thing about it. The therapy is behavior modification based upon being introduced to and working with other individuals who are experiencing the same condition as them. They’ll be able to communicate with each other and realize that they’re not alone. They’ll start to operate properly, so to speak (9/ 2017).

### 注意力缺失症/多动症

### Afterlife 

The afterlife refers to the soul’s transition to the energetic side after the human body demises. The soul may go to the astral levels in the physical universe or directly to its True Energetic Self (Higher Self, Oversoul, Godhead) higher up in the multiverse. 

**How does the soul feel right after death?** 

My wife (Anne) had brain cancer and she ascended on December 24, 2012. Since then I’ve had a number of communications with the “energetic Anne” who said she is enjoying herself in the energetic. Right after death I picked up that she was on the boundary of the Source Entity doing tumbles and gymnastics and all sorts of stuff to indicate that she was free, completely and utterly delighted with the total freedom that she got from being apart from her physical human form. I’ve had plenty of communications with her in her post-demise energetic condition specifically through cowriting the book called The Anne Dialogues. 

One of the things I’ve learned about grieving a loved one is that we anchor them to the physical by our intention to be with them. Our intention causes them to be lower frequency than they may want to be after they finish their incarnation. Our attachment creates an energetic link to their soul. It doesn’t help them in the slightest. In fact, it inhibits them big time. The same is also true for our attachments to animals or our pets that die. 

Naturally, it’s difficult for those of us who are left behind to understand the higher reason for why they left the physical to move on to the greater reality, but it was part of their life plan that was agreed upon in the energetic. We must accept their exit method, respect it, honor it and send them love in a nonattached way to help them move on. 

Otherwise, we are holding them back, retarding their progression upwards in the multiverse. When I logged into Anne days after she had ascended, she had moved onwards totally. She didn’t hang around, because she had experienced everything that she needed to experience in the depths and time frame that she needed to experience things. She was gone (12/ 2013). 

**What happens to the ego when reincarnation happens, instead of incarnation?** 

Basically, the ego dissolves after every incarnation. As we move up the frequencies, we lose our ego, because the ego is created through separation and we’re no longer part of separation after death. We are reintegrated with our TES in the higher frequencies of the multiverse. Even if we do a bounce or back-to-back reincarnation, where we come back into the energetic and go straight back into another incarnation, that particular ego dies and is absorbed. When we reincarnate, we have to go through the process of becoming energetic again before we can project that same aspect or another aspect of our TES into the physical via the use of the human vehicle (12/ 2013). 

**Does service to self lead to increased egoic actions?** 

Yes, unless the service to self is based upon making us more in tune, more self-actualized and more robust in our communication with the Source. If we’re being in service to ourselves and that service to ourselves means that we meditate every day, we put that above everything else and we achieve a robust and long term communicative link with the Source, then that service to our self will make us, by default, be of service to others. That will not increase our ego. 

But if we are in service to self from a materialistic perspective, that means riding roughshod over others, not helping those we have a chance to help, because we want to provide for ourselves rather than others, that will create an egoic condition, which is a completely different perspective (12/ 2013). 

**What happens to our earthly personality or human ego when we die?** 

The personality that’s in the human form is a very transient condition. It appears and grows purely, because of the near total loss of communication between the True Energetic Self and the aspect whilst it is projected into the human vehicle. Therefore, the aspect within the human form (or any incarnate body within the physical universe) starts to develop its own personality. That personality is sentient energy in an individualized state. It thinks it’s separated out or alone from what it is connected to, because that personality is experiencing life as a human being. 

For instance, we go to school, get involved with people, gain friendships and relationships. We have careers and what we think are successes and failures. We move forwards, backwards or sideways, as we experience things. We accrue a certain level of memories and experiences. All these things together create a human personality based upon how we interface with our family, friends and all the others we meet in life. This personality is what we call the ego. 

This ego is separate, so it doesn’t belong to the TES. It’s doomed to disappearing when the physical body demises. Most people, including spiritual people, don’t want their personality (or “identity”) to die, even if they recognize that they are part of a bigger entity that lives forever. The bit that’s grown in this lifetime dies when the physical body dies. This is the dichotomy that a lot of people have. They start to think of themselves as the physical body. The ego is trying to perpetuate itself and will do anything it can to substantiate the thought process that you are your incarnate body and that’s it. 

In reality, everything that the individual has been experiencing throughout its life has been naturally recorded by the TES as well. When the physical body dies, all that personality, including all those little traits, little likes, desires and preferences are also transmitted back to the TES, because these are the functions of experience. They are also the functions that allow evolutionary content to be accrued. 

Although we think that the personality dies with the physical body, actually the essence that created the personality exists continuously, because it’s being continuously recorded. So everything that created the personality is already recorded by the TES. Even if we find ourselves as a shard occupying a human body, then that information is first transported back to the aspect and then transported back to the TES as well. 

Therefore, the person we are, the memory set and everything isn’t lost at all, it’s just recorded in a different way. The ego created as a result of this personality does in fact disappear. It can’t be sustained any more, but everything that we are, including everything we’ve experienced and done, everything we’ve believed in, worked with and progressed with is already within the TES. It’s already within the Source and within the Origin as well. There is no loss of anything. 

If we start to become self-aware whilst we’re incarnate and recognize that there is a greater reality out there, we start to work with that greater reality, then the ego starts to get concerned and worried. It tries to keep us in the low frequencies to perpetuate its dominance over the physical form to keep us thinking that it is what we are. We get all sorts of feelings of fear and latch onto materialism. We deny or don’t believe in certain spiritual things, because the ego wants to sustain itself for as long as possible. 

But when the human body demises and the aspect moves back into the TES, we start to lose the smallness of our personality. We start to gain all of those memories, all those experiences, all the evolutionary content and everything that our aspect and all of the other aspects within our TES have accrued over the thousands of lifetimes at various different levels. We become bigger and absorb all of this information. 

When we gain all our memories back, it’s like all of a sudden, we come back from having a massive memory loss and we become everything that we were and everything else that was there. We become part of our TES again, although we still have an individualized part of ourselves, because the TES recognizes that we are “specialized” and it can reuse us for certain things and experiences again (2/ 2014). 

**Is the recording by the TES continuous? Or done in yearly or 7-year cycles?** 

No, it’s continuous. If you were to use a piece of computer terminology, it’s real time. Everything is recorded and absorbed by the TES in real time. Everything we experience, including what we are doing right now is instantaneously recorded. It’s just that the method of recording doesn’t eradicate the ego. 

From our human perspective, we may think, if this information goes back to the TES and is recorded, then why does this ego get created? The answer is it’s an automatic function. The ego is created through the near total separation of the aspect from the TES. Because the frequencies down here are so low, the ability of the aspect to communicate with the TES in a meaningful way is impossible or nearly impossible (2/ 2014). 

**How is that different from the Akashic records for individuals?** 

The Akashic is nothing to do with us, it’s something that the Source Entity creates that we use and work with. We can pull in all sorts of information from different people’s lives to augment our own abilities here. The Akashic records are specific to the information accrued by every aspect incarnated in the human form anywhere within the physical universe. We’re not the only humans in this universe. 

There are other records for all the other entities that incarnate in other form factors or alien species, such as insectoid, reptoid, humanoid, gaseoid, amoeboid, etc. So the Akashic records isn’t to do with the information accrued by the TES, it is like a database, which is accrued separately by the Source Entity based upon what every entity experiences when it incarnates in the physical universe (2/ 2014). 

**Are the records kept in the Earth, Sun or galactic centers as well?** 

The Akashic records are beyond the physical— they are outside of the “hard structure” we call the physical universe. It’s in the rest of the multiverse. We would access it when we’re disincarnate, not as part of our incarnate existence, although there are individuals who can clearly tap into them with their special gifts or abilities that have been carried through with them as part of this incarnation. They are allowed to remember certain things, so they can access the Akashic records at a certain level whilst incarnate. 

The Akashic record is a database. There are databases based upon individuals who have incarnated on Earth or other areas within the physical universe. You could log into the Akashic and say, “Okay, tell me about certain individuals who have incarnated on Earth or on a planet in the Orion Nebula.” You could do it that way (2/ 2014). 

**In The Anne Dialogues you said after the demise of the human vehicle, an aspect can keep creating their temporary environment until it recognizes where it is, whereas those working with the higher frequencies go straight into the life review process.** 

This is like being inside a totally contained individualized ”reality bubble” that we’ve created by ourselves. Souls who are totally immersed in their incarnation simply don’t recognize that they have died. Their physical form is demised, but they don’t know that they are energy beings now. They can and do recreate everything around them that they previously experienced on Earth. 

For instance, they can recreate their house, their friends, their family, the neighborhood that they lived in— their whole world is basically recreated. It takes a long time for them to come out the other side to what is called “energetic self-realization” to know who and what they really are. There’s a lot of work done by the guide and helpers to move them out of this condition or reality. 

But when one is aware and awake, the soul moves straight into the energetic and understands what’s going on and goes into the life review process in the various different forms that takes, as described in The Anne Dialogues. Those who are totally immersed do struggle. Some break out of it fairly straight away. But others can stay there for hundreds of years, even thousands of years in terms of human “time.” It’s up to them, as to how fast they break out of this recreated environment. It’s also about the skill of the guide and helpers to help them move out of it. 

One of the images I got is that there can be a whole group of aspects working together in the energies. Then you have one that’s got a sphere around them— like a sphere around a sphere. That sphere is their individualized reality. They’ve recreated their human incarnate reality. They don’t see anybody else. 

They are energetically there but surrounded by another sphere, which is the creation of their reality that they want to stay with. This other sphere needs to be broken down and that’s what the guide and helpers work hard to try to remove that. There’s no limit, no rules or regulations as to how long this individually generated reality can be there— from a few seconds to a few millennia. That’s how it works. It’s unfortunate that our ability to be incarnate can end up going beyond the demise of the human form (12/ 2016). 

**How long can a soul stay in this “limbo state” before entering into the life review? Is this where all the addictions have to get ‘karmically addressed’ through quarantine?** 

There’s no rules or normality associated with how long it takes to move out of one particular state of self-created limbo vs. moving out of the environment and going back into the energetic. Those who have to have their addictions karmically addressed, they can do it either within that reality through the skillful interaction of the guide and helpers or they have to go to a quarantine area where the addictions that could potentially affect the True Energetic Self have to be totally removed. 

That requires a lot of skill on behalf of the TES and the guide and helpers. They have to sort of relive or re-experience those things that created the addictions that created the karmic links and get to the point where they are no longer addicted or attracted to them. When they have achieved that state, then the aspect can move out of the quarantine levels (12/ 2016). 

**Is this ‘time’ in limbo reflected in an inability to communicate with the aspect’s TES?** 

From their perspective, yes. But from the perspective of the TES with the aspect, no. The guide and helpers can still communicate with the aspect in the same way as when the aspect was incarnate. That’s the problem. They’re having to work with the limited ability and functions and the limited communicative bandwidth of the aspect, because it is still working within the confines of incarnation or lower frequency existence even though it’s not there any longer (12/ 2016). 

**What about the ability for the newly demised aspect to communicate with still incarnate systems, such as human, plants, nonhuman animals and nature itself?** 

The newly demised aspect really wouldn’t want to communicate with the still incarnate systems, such as animals, plants, nonhuman animals and nature, although it can do that. The only time an aspect would want to communicate with a human is when there’s a loved one that is still incarnate that needs to be given a message, a sign or some communication to tell them that the departed soul is still in existence. There are times when souls want to give consolation to those who are still in the incarnate state who don’t know or remember who and what they truly are, so they experience bereavement, sadness and loss (12/ 2016). 

**How does this ’time out’ affect the physical reality? Does it contribute to the lack of understanding of the cause-effect ripples in our lives?** 

The physical reality actually isn’t affected in real terms. As humans we just linearize things. If you think of the individual who is within the quarantine area (because there’s too much karma that would contaminate the TES) or the entity that’s stuck within its own reality, the limbo state is in a different event space. 

When they come out of that event space, they may have spent thousands of years in human terms to get out of that event space. But from our soul’s energetic perspective, it could be nothing. It could be a second or a minute or it could be a hundred years. It just depends upon the entry and exit points of the event space used. 

This sort of shows everything can occur concurrently. Although we create this linear existence from a time-based perspective whilst we’re here, in actual fact it doesn’t really mean anything as such. The physical reality is also part of the greater reality, but we linearize it from the human perspective. 

Somebody can spend an awful long time in one of these quarantine areas or limbo conditions, so it can appear to be like a couple of seconds on the physical plane or they can spend a few hours in limbo or in the quarantine and it could appear to be days, weeks, months or years in the physical. 

It just depends upon how the aspect enters into that event space and how it exits that event space and where that event space was interacting with the event space that we call the physical environment. Also it can still move around just to make things more complicated. So if it was potentially a hundred years and the event space sort of reappears a hundred years in the future, the aspect might want to bring it back to a few seconds after it demised, because it can still move things around. 

It can enter into another event space and come out the other side a few seconds after the demise process. Therefore, the time period associated with the physical world or physical universe isn’t affected. It’s simply the personal experience that is affected and the personal interaction with self, guides, helpers and the environment that is affected (12/ 2016). 

**When souls reincarnate, is there a minimum or maximum or average time spent between lives before reincarnation? Is that changed fo a soul doing back-to-back lives?**

No, provided that we have the authority to come into what I call back-to-back lives, we can go from one incarnation to another incarnation or we can spend millennia away from incarnating. It just depends upon what our True Energetic Self has got in store for this particular soul or individualization of its sentience or whether there’s an overall plan to experience something that spans a number of different lives. 

It is a case of what is part of the big overall plan to experience, learn and evolve. It can be that we can be here instantaneously in the next body or we can go into a walk-in and leave one body that has died and then walk-in to another body, which is already mature. There is no maximum or minimum or average time, it’s just completely individualized as to what we do and how we do it. But it’s also individualized based upon what’s available for us and how important what we’re going to experience is in the overall picture. 

So our guides and helpers and the guide and helpers of other souls and all our True Energetic Selves have a much bigger plan that is so massive that we would never be able to understand it in our human condition. Basically, everything is there and the whole point of evolutionary experience is laid out in front of us. 

If you read The Anne Dialogues, it goes into more detail as to what we do in between our lives. We are governed by the desires of our True Energetic Self, but depending upon our own evolutionary level, we can influence our TES as well, if we have a plan. That depends upon the type of recommunion with our TES we have (7/ 2018). 

**How is the energetic like the physical? Are there famous people/ souls/ entities? Are there vacations, entertainment, travel to see different things? Do we have some best friends that we hang around with? Is there a history that we all agree upon in the energetic?** 

My understanding is that we are all equal. We are all in recognition of our connectivity with our True Energetic Self and with Source in relationship to what we’ve experienced and how we’ve evolved on behalf of our TES and how our TES has evolved on behalf of Source. So there’s no fame. There’s no entertainment or travel to see different things. But we do gravitate towards our TES and those aspects that are part of our TES are within the collective we call the soul group. 

We do have aspects of sentience that we prefer to be with, because they’re part of our soul group. We do also have other aspects of sentience or other individuals from other TESs that we have worked with in previous incarnations that we relate to from an incarnate perspective. It’s not so much that we would hang out with them, but we would work with them to understand what we’re doing next, if we decided to work with them in another incarnation— how that might benefit them and us and others who we interact with as a function of that particular incarnation. 

We’re all in communion and that’s the best way to say it. We’re either in various different forms of individualized communion or in full communion with our TES. The TES itself only enters into full communion when it has finished the evolutionary cycle. We communicate with those other aspects that are individualized whilst in partial communion. But we probably wouldn’t do that, if we are in full communion with our TES rather than an individualized function of it. The rest of the work is about understanding how we’re going to experience, how we’re going to evolve or how we have experienced and how we have evolved. 

The life plan is the creation of how we can experience things and the life review is what we’ve experienced, how we’ve evolved and how our guides and helpers have evolved as a result. Although they are not in the evolutionary cycle, they’ve progressed as a function of working with us, so they’ve benefitted from working with us and learned how to increase the efficiency of their guidance as well. 

So it’s not like being on Earth at all. If we are struggling to detach ourselves from our human incarnation, we can and do at times create an Earth-like environment around us after death. Then you could have famous people’s souls or entities having vacations, entertainment and travel to different parts of the temporary reality that we create around ourselves— simply as a function of not quite grasping the fact that we’ve become disincarnate and need to detach from the Earth environment. 

So anything that is Earth-like that is around us when we’re disincarnate is purely a projection that we’ve created, because we haven’t quite detached from the Earth or haven’t quite understood that we are now back into the energetic and are no longer incarnate. 

From a human perspective, it’s total freedom. We’re not constrained to anything. We are able to be anywhere and everywhere concurrently should we wish to be. We are pretty much as omnipresent and as omniscient as we can be, based on the limited sentience of our TES, which is a smaller unit of Source. Although we have the functions associated with those abilities, they are limited towards the level of sentience that we have. 

The human condition is more like being in treacle (molasses), whereas we have ultimate freedom energetically when we’re disincarnate. We can create a human condition, if we wanted to. We can create Earth in heaven, if you want to. But once you get there, you realize how unnecessary that is (12/ 2018). 

**Yogananda described heavenly astral worlds that “good souls” experience between lives— like heaven. Most souls don’t go to these, but sleep unconsciously in between lives and reawaken in a womb, whereas “bad souls” are tormented with hellish nightmares?** 

You have to understand that Yogananda wrote things based upon the level of education that he had, the experience that he had and what he thought people would be able to digest in his day. It's about understanding the level of detail that one can absorb and one's readers can absorb. 

When Yogananda talks about these things, he's talking about individuals who are immersed in their incarnate condition. Sometimes this information, which I believe at the moment is being rewritten, revamped and redistributed as the lessons, is misunderstood. You have to understand that Yogananda probably understood an awful lot more than what he described to his disciples or his followers, because they wouldn't have been able to understand it (7/ 2019). 

**I don't think this fits how you describe the afterlife where the soul is fully of aware of the dying process, its departure, its life review and various types of communion?** 

He had to bring it down to basic information. Things like hellish nightmares or being stuck in astral worlds is because certain individuals would link themselves to the Earth still. 

Individuals who are going into back-to-back incarnations would stay within frequencies that are almost physical. Don't forget the astral worlds are within the physical universe at the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th frequencies. If the individual wanted to go above the astral, which is the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th frequencies, it would still be within the physical universe. 

So it's about understanding that individuals who do back-to-back incarnations wouldn't go very far frequentially before they come back into an incarnation. They would fall asleep or die in one incarnation and wake up in the fetus of another incarnation, for instance. 

Individuals who have hellish nightmares would be those individuals who are so karmically linked to the Earth that they refuse to leave it. They would experience the lower frequencies available to them, which would be the lower astral where they start to see things like lower frequency astral entities that can present to us quite abhorrent images of themselves to try to distract us from seeing them or try to give themselves power over us, for instance (7/ 2019). 

**Do only advanced souls go through a conscious afterlife process?** 

It's all about understanding the bigger picture. I'll give you an example of how to understand the bigger picture. When we read the Bible, we could just read the Bible and understand things in terms of the information there. But if you look at the way Yogananda described some of the information in the Bible, there is hidden information there. There's more information behind what he is saying. That's because he came to the western world in the 1920s and departed in 1952 when people’s understanding of spirit and the greater reality was very limited. We thought that "ether" was the next level up from us and that radio waves were “ether” 50 years earlier. 

It's all to do with the level of education. If we are becoming self-realized and we're working on ourselves, then we will go through the understanding and awareness that is in The Anne Dialogues. Individuals who are stuck or attracted to the Earth frequencies will experience different levels of limbo or torturous environments, because their soul knows they've got to move on, but they still think they are incarnate, so they want to stay. 

Those who go unconsciously between lives are those who are doing back-to-back incarnations. After they've done the series of back-to-back incarnations that they're supposed to achieve, then they will go through a life review at the end where they understand exactly what they've done, how they've experienced it in terms of the links between the lives, how the things they were supposed to do successfully in one life was then projected into being successful in the next life. 

It's about understanding the depth and detail behind it. Don't just take one level of text as being the be all and end all. Look at all texts, because all the texts together provide the bigger picture. Even The Anne Dialogues is only a very small aspect of what we experience before, during and after incarnation and in the period between incarnations or recommunion with our TES. Look at the bigger picture and understand that some of this information is based upon the education, ability to understand and expansiveness of the teacher, what was taught to them and how expansive their own teachers were at the time. Take everything into consideration (7/ 2019). 

**How should we think of our loved ones who have passed? They may have moved on to a new incarnation or been reabsorbed into the TES or are still individualized disincarnates?** 

The best way to think about those who have passed on and moved out of their physical incarnation is to consider them as going back into what they were, which is sentient energy and recognize that this sortie on Earth is not even a blink of an eye in terms of our normal existence and our longevity in this evolutionary cycle. 

The way to think about our loved ones who are back "Home" in their normal environment is to be grateful for the role they played in helping us become incarnate. They provided a springboard for us to experience, learn and evolve in this incarnation. They helped us with the skill sets we brought in from other incarnations to navigate through this lifetime as efficiently as possible. We thank them for paving the way, so that we can pave the way for the other bodies we’ve created, so that other souls (our children) can incarnate (4/ 2020). 

**They may have incarnated as my son or my grandkids or gone into the next adventure?** 

We just have to think that they've moved on. Some of them will have done a back-to-back incarnation and may well have come back as one of our grandchildren. It's highly unlikely, but it does happen in very, very rare cases. Most of the time though, they will have moved on and entered into some form of life review or understanding the life they had, which includes the work that their guide and helpers have done. Some of them have moved straight through it and entered into some form of partial or full communion with their TES. 

They have progressed in some way either energetically or frequentially. They may have evolved or not evolved. They may have recommuned with their TES. They have moved out of this incarnation into the rest of their existence and may well come back to another incarnation. 

Know that they've evolved in the way that they're supposed to have evolved. They're progressing in the way that they're supposed to progress. Just send them thanks for helping you progress. They've done their role in providing a springboard for us in this rather unique environment with a unique responsibility by having individualized free will (4/ 2020). 

**Is it appropriate to send them love, communicate with them or is it just a memory?** 

You can send them love. They will always receive love, because it's a very potent energy to send. Every entity in the multiverse will feel love, if you project it out and broadcast it. Every entity that is in an incarnation on this planet and other environments within the physical universe and other entities within the multiverse will always feel our love. Just because we think we're small doesn't mean that what we do isn't big. Just send them thanks and love (4/ 2020). 

**If what we call death really occurs when a soul goes from the energetic to the physical, does a soul in the energetic also experience trepidation, fear or terror right before it incarnates?** 

This is basically turning around our thinking— what we call “death” is incarnation and what we call “birth” is going back into the energetic. My knowledge and experience suggests that souls are excited about becoming incarnate. We very quickly forget the trials and tribulations we’ve had in previous incarnations. We move on quite quickly and become very enthusiastic about another incarnation. 

The knowledge base of who and what we are is a function of the frequencies, so our lack of communicative bandwidth is sort of taken in stride, and as a result, there is no trepidation. It’s sort of, “Great, having a chance of incarnating at a lower frequency, so we can evolve faster!” It’s more about motivated excitement rather than trepidation or fear. It’s probably going to create a bit of a stir to think that as souls we are thinking in that way, but we do. 

When we’re in the energetic, things that we think are horrible are just a passing split moment. Things like dying in an accident or in a war or a plane crash or cancer or Covid-19 are simply a way of moving out of one incarnation and coming back into the energetic where we normally belong. It’s just considered an exit point, a termination juncture and nothing to be even worried about. It’s like turning off the switch on a TV— simple as that (5/ 2021). 

**You said the ego dissolves after we die. But Gordon Phinn “interviews” dead celebrities in the afterlife via astral projection. They seem to retain their personality decades after death and engage in activities, like composing music, writing, painting just like on Earth. What is going on?** 

This is interesting, because the next question is almost the same question, but said in a slightly different way. I’m going answer it all in one go (8/ 2021). 

**William Buhlman, Tom Campbell, Lobsang Rampa and others speak about “consensus realities” when they travel to astral planes. People of the same faith live together, go to church or mosque and think they are in heaven. What are these consensus realities?** 

Basically, the “self-realized” aspect will not create a reality around themselves that supports where they think they are or where they think they’re going to (e.g. heaven or hell). 

For instance, Yogananda would have gone straight back into communion with its True Energetic Self and so would have Jesus, Mohammed and the Buddha. They would bypass all of this astral stuff, because it’s not necessary. They know who and what they are and they simply regain their memory set and the quality of sentience associated with being part of the TES— even if they may still be projected from their TES whilst they’re in the energetic in the pre-life, during and post-life review after death, which evolves not just the soul, but also the guide and helpers. 

But there are other souls who don’t recognize that they’ve moved beyond the gross physical. They feel they are still incarnate. They don’t know that their body is demised. They just feel that they are still in existence. Some of these entities stick around the planet in the lowest levels possible, which are the lower astral levels at the 4th and 5th frequency level. 

We sometimes see them as ghosts or poltergeist activity with the movement of objects, as they’re trying to get our attention that they’re still around. Sensitive people can see them with their spiritual or third eye. 

We all create this overall reality called the physical universe in all its intricacies. We collectively work with that. But there are those who recognize that they are disincarnate, but they have taken a belief system with them, such as believing they’re going to go to heaven. They’re going to meet all sorts of different angels that look like human beings with wings, so that’s what they project. That’s their expectation— to go into all these different levels. 

Even yogis can be in this location. In Autobiography of a Yogi Yogananda’s guru, Sri Yukteswar, is in the astral plane and visits Yogananda. A similar thing happens with the lama associated with Lobsang Rampa. They are in an environment that they expected to go to. 

The lama Mingyar Dondup mentored Lobsang Rampa and Sri Yukteswar mentored Yogananda. But both of them came from an astral level. Both of them were working there, because they were indoctrinated or told so often that the astral is where they would go to, so that’s what they create when their physical form dies. 

Even though they are self-realized individuals, their level of self-realization is limited to the understanding surrounding the methods of education used to create the level of self-realization. People like them and other people who become disincarnate when their body is demised will go into the energetic, but they project around themselves an environment, which supports what they expect to be in. This projection can manifest in more than one way. 

The first one is very personal, so the soul can create landscapes and buildings within that reality. They can create familiar individuals that they interact with. They are so convinced that they are where they are, because they’ve projected this reality. The second one is where there’s various different levels of this, where other individuals support or have the same expectation, so that projection gets augmented by the sentience of another soul who expects to see nirvana, utopia, heaven, all the astral worlds, etc. 

So you start to get a reality that could potentially start with one disincarnate individual who is expecting to see different characters from history, such as Jesus, Mohammed, the Buddha or their family members. They are there, because they create them. They can create literally whole cities, even planets around themselves to support what they expected to see, because that’s what they totally believe would happen, because somebody of authority told them that’s what happens. Rather than moving through the plane of energetic existence, they become part of a collective reality to experience a certain environment in a certain way. 

You get lots of these pockets or bubbles of environments that are created by souls who are supporting each other in perpetuating this “consensus reality” or collective reality, which is the same as them wanting to interact with each other on the astral level. 

Celebrities or famous individuals continue to do that, because they expect to be in a heaven where they’re doing what they love doing. Bizarrely enough, if somebody was told often enough by an authority that they truly trusted that they’re going to end up being a cherub on a big white cloud with a harp and a bow and arrow, then that’s what they would create. That’s what happens. 

We tend to be programmed by those individuals around us who we trust, because they are authoritative and they have enough understanding to create a level of not just believability but truth— but in a way which is limited. We work with that rather than being exposed to the greater reality as it is, so we create an environment around us and we collectively work with it together, if a number of us want to or expect to experience the same thing that is human and Earth like. This is what’s happening here. 

People are experiencing the Earth, because they feel they’re going to experience things and individuals who support that belief system around them. They create their own heaven in the astral levels. They don’t move on. That’s the same with these consensus realities. They are people who are expecting to experience certain things and they don’t move on. 

Eventually, the guide and helpers will support them. They’ll make them realize that the reality isn’t exactly what the reality is. They do eventually get extracted from it and that reality dissolves. All those souls that were in the realities start to move back up the frequencies properly and reintegrate or go into communion with their True Energetic Self. 

There’s another version of it as well. That is something called limbo where souls just stay unconscious, because they expect nothing. They expect nothingness. There are those who expect to go into a grey consciousness or a black consciousness where they’re just there. Their souls are in this grey limbo or dark consciousness or pure white consciousness, but don’t do anything. 

Their guide and helpers know this and work with certain functions that will eventually get the soul to wake up properly, so that they can become reintegrated with the energies of their TES. The best thing is to realize one thing— we are sentient energy existing in a multiversal environment within a larger entity we call Source or God, and therefore, we are part of it. We are smaller individualized units of sentience. We are beyond the projections that create the Earth-like environment. 

We can’t possibly understand that while we’re here, because we’ve chosen to adapt to our environment as a function of the ego and lack of communication between the soul and its True Energetic Self, which is who and what we are normally. 

We have to be totally expansive in our expectations and thought processes and recognize that anything that appears to be human when the physical form is demised is an indication that we’ve moved into what our underlying expectation is and/ or that we’ve slipped into the expectations of somebody else that supports our expectations. Therefore, we’ve moved into a consensus reality where we have projected around us an environment with circumstances and individuals within it based upon what we expected to experience. 

If you suddenly find that you’re in one of these when your body is demised, just try to remember that this isn’t what you really are. This is just something that you’ve created and you need to move out of it. Simply broadcast your desire for your guide and helpers to extract you from it and you’ll be back where you should be— in the environment interacting with your True Energetic Self and Source in the way you should be (8/ 2021).

### Aliens 

Aliens are souls (like us) that incarnate somewhere in the physical universe to experience, learn and evolve. Their physical vehicles come in myriad shapes and sizes, such as humanoid, insectoid, reptoid, amoeboid, bird people, lion people, synthetic forms or purely energetic forms. 

**This week the CIA released 13 million declassified documents, including UFO sightings. Did some governments have First Contact with alien species during World War II? Is this to prepare us for worldwide “Disclosure” about aliens soon?** 

In terms of “Disclosure,” the aliens are already here. They move around us. Most of the time they are higher frequency than where we are and what we can perceive, which is higher than the 3rd frequency level (FB 3). Any sort of Disclosure isn’t really relevant to those human beings who are high enough frequency within their own incarnate state to be able to perceive them. There are many people on Earth who can do that, myself included. In terms of us understanding or disclosing them, if you know they’re here, there’s nothing to disclose. We know they’re here. 

There are various different levels of contact that have occurred and different technologies that have been discovered. Some were not alien, but Earth based technologies that were here and uncovered. Certainly, the Third Reich were very good at hunting down some of these old technologies and working out how they operated and mastering them in some respects (1/ 2017). 

**Did some governments have First Contact with alien species during World War II (e.g. Hitler, Eisenhower)? Why do people have “abduction” experiences?** 

There are contacts. It’s not specifically governments that have contact. The entities try to find people who are understanding. We talk about aliens being malevolent— some of the interactions with them can be classified as that. But it’s mainly to do with individuals who are in a so-called “secondary incarnation” in the human form. It’s like doing two lives at the same time. The same soul is split into two incarnate vehicles with a human life on Earth and an alien life higher up. 

When we have abductions, it’s because the soul associated with that human vehicle has a “primary incarnation” in an alien vehicle associated with the entities abducting them. The aliens are getting downloads and things from the human body, because that soul has decided to experiment being here as a secondary human incarnation, whilst also being at a different location as a primary alien incarnation. It’s based on a previous soul agreement (1/ 2017). 

**Did they reverse engineer the alien craft and technology (e.g. Greys in Roswell)?** 

There are elements of individuals who have managed to gain craft and reverse engineer them. Clearly, reverse engineering is only available to us, if we are capable of understanding that science in the first place. The level of reverse engineering was limited in the early days when they first appeared on Earth or the craft that were discovered here were damaged. 

We have more computing technology now than anything else on this planet, so we’re able to understand and decipher some of the operating systems and power sources of these craft. But even now, we really don’t have any understanding of the propulsion systems of these things. 

There has been an attempt to reverse engineer them, but you can only reverse engineer something, if you’ve got a level of technology, which is equal to that technology that you’re trying to reverse engineer. That’s engineering full stop. That’s technology and science full stop. 

The only way we would be able to do that is if we were being given help by the entities themselves. There are various entities who have given us technologies, but those technologies were given to us subliminally or telepathically or via the guides and helpers of the entities who decided to incarnate and be here to introduce new technologies to people, such as Edison and Marconi and others who made amazing breakthroughs in technology (1/ 2017). 

**Is this to prepare us for worldwide “Disclosure” about aliens soon?** 

At some point in the next 50 years, there will be a big surge in the level of understanding. As we move higher up the frequencies, then “Disclosure” won’t be so much disclosure, it will be more discovery that there’s people and objects here anyway. It’s going to be a natural thing rather than a sudden governmental thing. 

Some of the science fiction films and the stories surrounding science fiction or science fact or spiritual subjects or metaphysical subjects are being used to help to educate us and get us ready for it (1/ 2017). 

**Is humanity being protected by benevolent aliens from destroying itself with nuclear weapons (e.g. launch code malfunction). Is that true in some event streams, not in others?** 

The Earth is an important location in terms of its evolutionary opportunity through individualized free will. There are a number of entities who are of a higher frequency, who are protecting the asset, so to speak. We are allowed to do certain things, such as the explosion of certain thermonuclear devices as long as it’s within a certain tolerance. We are allowed to progress in certain ways with the understanding that it has to be within a certain tolerance. If it’s over a certain tolerance, then there are things that go wrong or don’t happen, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that is not doing what it’s supposed to do. The information that the LHC is doing is easily produced by sacred geometry— something that you can put in your hand would create what the LHC is trying to do. There’s roads that we’re going down that are tolerated, but if they go out of a certain tolerance, then they are neutralized. 

In terms of hotspots of conflict around the world— even in the physical universe, there are local areas of locally high frequency and local areas of locally low frequency. Those areas will always result in differences of opinion. They are the areas where there is conflict. 

The areas of locally low frequency cause conflicts where people are fighting against each other to try and prove their point. The areas of locally high frequency are where people understand each other, work together and create a collective understanding rather than an individualized understanding. As we ascend the frequencies, the need to exist within the lower frequencies of the Earth starts to dissipate, so we will start to move away from this naturally. The numbers of low frequency hotspots will start to disappear, as the base ambient frequency of where we exist in starts to rise (1/ 2017). 

**What are the “4D” humanoid aliens called the “Anunnaki?” Are “Anu” particles named after them?** 

In my understanding, “4D” would mean the fourth frequency (FB 4). We’re in the first dimension, which is the physical universe that has 12 frequencies (FB 1-12) within it. These 12 frequencies have very low resolution, so none of them can create a universe in their own right. When all 12 levels are put together, they create the physical universe, which is the first full dimension (FD 1) in our multiverse. 

The Anu particles are the lowest manifested physical function of the physical universe. They are the smallest particles that create who and what we are and the environment that we’re in. So it looks like these entities have been given a name based upon what you could classify as the start or beginning of. These entities are not specifically of the 4th frequency, they’re just slightly higher frequency. 

The Anu particles have nothing to do with the Anunnaki, although their gross physical forms are created by these particles, as is our human form and the rest of the physical universe (1/ 2017). 

**Some Anunnaki sects came to Mars, mined it and destroyed it. They came to Earth about 400,000 years ago. They worked with the Atlanteans, became their guides and rulers.** 

My understanding is that there have been episodes similar to what’s been described. There are times when some entities may take advantage of a lower level of intelligence. If an incarnate civilization are low enough in frequency and not able to understand the bigger picture, these entities will try to use a civilization of a lower intelligence or lower technology to assist them in some way— whether you want to call it “slavery” or “partnership” is up to you, but there are times when this happens. 

There are entities who have been given higher technological understanding and higher teachings associated with being in the higher frequencies and being able to create higher frequencies. Sometimes to accelerate the development of the human form, there has been manipulation of the genome. 

Generally, manipulation of the genome was done by the group of entities who worked with other entities (e.g. Caretakers of the Physical Universe specializing in vehicles, population, habitation, atmosphere, etc.) to create this area of the physical universe associated with free will. Most of the genetic manipulation is done because of the opportunity for accelerated evolutionary growth. This group of entities (Curators) work on behalf of the Source to manage, manipulate and maintain the evolutionary efficiency of the multiversal environment for us (1/ 2017). 

**They genetically manipulated human beings to make them a slave race to work in their mining projects in Africa, then gave humans the ability to procreate themselves (with split genders). They changed and accelerated the Earth experiment.** 

This question talks about changing the human body to create the male and female genders. The entities changed and accelerated the Earth experiment. My understanding is that there are certain levels of manipulation associated with entities who are working either for themselves or on behalf of some of the Curators and some of those other entities who are in control of the physical universe. 

In general, they are being done by those entities who are controlling the physical universe and looking after the evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse and the experiment, which is to do with individualized free will. Any real change in the genome of the human form is being done by these beings— one of the Councils. We’ve talked about the Council of Twelve, but there’s a Council of Twelve associated with each of the frequency levels that support incarnation. 

When we look at the different versions of the human form described in The History of God, we see that the human vehicle has changed or has been changed to suit the changing ambient frequency on Earth. When the human form was higher frequency, it was recreated energetically by the separation out of particles or atoms to create two bodies out of one body. Then it was copied in a similar way, so one body became two, then two bodies equal four, then four bodies equal eight, etc. 

Eventually, we descended into much lower frequencies, so the body needed to become more gross physical to be able to experience and interact with that gross environment. Eventually, the reproduction process was based upon hermaphrodites (with both genders inside one body). But that wasn’t good enough, because of the transmission of genetic dysfunctions, so we needed various other means to create more diversified bodies. One of those was the creation of the two genders where the genders would get together to procreate and create a more robust body. 

The human forms could come from various different locations with different levels of immunity, fitnesses, physical benefits, etc. Those that were physically strong were the bodies that would survive. Those that adapted would survive and those that didn’t adapt wouldn’t survive. This is where you get Darwinian evolution or the survival of the fittest. 

There are lots of different races from different parts of the galaxy existing on Earth now, as you can see from the different bone structures, eye structures, skin colors associated with various different locations on the Earth. All the different races on Earth are those gross physical bodies that have adapted and survived when they would normally have died off as a result of the change in frequency. 

All of the different types of genomes on the Earth are the result of a new body being introduced. Sometimes that new body was developed in a different part of the physical universe, a different part of the galaxy and introduced on Earth to cope with the lower frequencies. 

If a body was a higher frequency and it was subjected to a lower frequency, it either died off or some of them started to adapt to work in the lower frequencies and became lower frequency as well. That’s why we have all the lowest frequency bodies and all the diversification of the different genomes, bone structures, muscle types, color, eye types and skin types as well. 

There’s been two things in terms of the manipulation of the human genome: one that’s being done by lower frequency but nevertheless star faring entities. There are various stories about the Anunnaki, but most of it is sort of passed down through legend, which has been distorted and destroyed and become misinformation. There’s other bodies that have been manipulated by those entities that govern the physical universe to allow the human body to be more compatible within the frequencies that we’re starting to work with (1/ 2017). 

**They procreated with some humans to establish “blood lines” of rulers (e.g. Illuminati)?** 

Procreation with other humans to establish new blood lines— that’s just a function of genetic manipulation. With all of these things, when things are explained to us, we could only work with the language and understanding based upon our own evolutionary level and technological experience and the language surrounding it. The words used to explain things that have happened would have been relevant to the language and the understanding of the time. 

What could be classified as “procreation” could have been simply genetic or DNA strand introduction, for instance. Things would have been done in a test tube or in a higher frequential state rather than simple procreation of one incarnate vehicle type with another, because there needs to be compatibility. The only way that some of them are compatible would have been through the splicing of the genome together rather than physical interaction. 

The physical interaction with human beings on Earth from my understanding is fairly unique, so it would have needed to be at the DNA level. The different physical forms are based upon the environment that they exist in— depending upon whether they are in a silicon or a carbon based environment or a crystalline based environment or other types of environments or the atmosphere of the planet or wherever the vehicles are used to experience life within the physical universe (1/ 2017). 

**In The History of God you wrote: "The aliens haven't contacted you yet but they will." Is this within our lifetime?** 

We are surrounded by other incarnate entities at different levels of frequencies— sometimes higher than us, sometimes the same level. They are here now, but they use various different shielding technologies, because they’re very clever and higher frequency, so we’re not able to detect them. Nevertheless, they’re here. They’re using the Earth in higher frequencies in conjunction with us, sometimes in sympathy with us. But we are not ready to connect with any other incarnate entity yet, because we haven’t sorted ourselves out. 

When we decide to work individually for the collective of mankind and without thinking of ourselves only, then we’ll start to work with, look after and nurture our planet, nurture the plants, our children and older people and drastically reduce any waste products from the generation of food, packaging, transportation mediums, fuel types, radiation, etc. Once we’ve managed all of that, we will be able to detect these aliens. Some of them will make themselves known and others we will detect when we become higher frequency in a natural way (1/ 2018). 

**What can you tell me about the Sphere Being Alliance, in particular the Blue Avians? I have read that they are here to assist us through the ascension process. What is your knowledge or opinion on these entities? Have you ever been contacted by them?** 

No, I’ve not been contacted by them to be honest. But there’s lots of New Age or spiritual misdirection going around based upon the thoughts, behaviors and actions or desire to create a particular reality. There are quite obviously incarnate civilizations that work together on various different frequencies within the gross physical universe. Those that are towards the end of the gross physical universe are more energetic. They will support us where they can, if it’s relevant and if they’re asked to assist us to make sure that we don’t make a mess of things with our individualized free will. 

There’s a lot of them— the Arcturians and Sirians are some of these entities that do this. The Blue Avians are a completely new civilization to me. I don’t know about them at all. It’s not because they’re not there, it’s because I haven’t researched into them or communicated with them at all. There are many entities, including incarnate human beings who are assisting in our ascension process, because they recognize the benefit of ascension through individualized free will, which is the whole point of the Earth experiment (2/ 2018). 

**In The History of God the entities living in the Sun are in communication with incarnate entities on Earth who understand some concepts used to create new elements. Are these humans aware that they are in contact with entities living in the Sun?** 

The interaction of these entities on the Sun’s surface with those on the Earth is really based upon an energetic and intuitive interaction. In terms of human beings, it’s giving certain human beings a better description or an idea to the entities that are here that are higher frequency. The materials with the craft or the devices have new elements that are not available on Earth. When we sometimes have a craft captured or crashed here, that material has been difficult to identify or not identified at all (2/ 2018). 

**Are they involved in the creation of new elements not native to the Sun or our solar system— at a higher scale (e.g. atomic numbers 95-118) on the periodic table?**

There are a number of different elements that can only be created through nuclear reactions, either fission or fusion. Some of those elements that are created by fission are not created by fusion and vice versa. But these are things that we will discover and these entities are working with certain individuals who are capable of understanding the concept. 

It’s more like giving the ideas to those who are capable of expanding their mind. Some elements are in a sideways periodic table and some of them are above or below. The periodic table should be three-dimensional as a matrix, not the two-dimensional thing we see right now. There’s some elements behind it that join together without the use of chemical means. They naturally grow together (2/ 2018). 

**In The History of God the aliens help with the progress of technology. Are aliens the source for technological breakthroughs, such as computer chips, medical devices, space craft, etc.?** 

They and those entities who remain disincarnate and work with the human beings who are open to suggestion are the source of some of our major technology leaps. Once we understand that technological leap in whichever direction it’s going into, we can work on it ourselves and move forwards ourselves, so they help us to move in certain directions. 

There are aliens in higher frequency incarnate vehicles and in this frequency who are working in the grace of the Source. They are putting little nuggets in our way for us to understand and then use those techniques to move further and forwards. 

Clearly, there’s a lot of technological progressions we’ve had in the last fifty years that have been quantum leaps for us. You can see the evidence that we have had help in some way, shape or form either from the guides and helpers of those human beings who have come to bring those to light, such as Baird, Marconi or Edison, for instance. 

There’s others who have been given help through suggestion via telepathic communication. Sometimes there is actual handing over of physical technology, but that’s generally from those incarnate entities who are working for the higher good and based upon the third frequency, which is where we are now (5/ 2018). 

**In The History of God the aliens are helping us develop machines to tap into the limitless free energy available to us. Will any of us live to see an actual machine that will do this?** 

There are machines already available and they are hidden for a number of different reasons. I’m not creating a conspiracy here, but there are very powerful companies who rely on fossil fuels, who don’t want to lose their business to individualized machines— machines that would be the size of a packing case that would provide enough power to energize a house for a year or two. It’s not in their best interests to allow this to happen, but they do exist. There’s a number of them there. Some of them are based upon hydrogen cracking. Some of them are based upon zero point energy. Some are based upon using the orgone or tapping into the free energy. Some of them are based upon certain levels of sacred geometry. There’s one American chap who was very good at using sacred geometry to create weather conditions and changes. It was not sacred geometry per se, but that was the exterior appearance of it. 

It was the type of materials that were together that made that geometry work. Some of it rotated, some of it didn’t. They created an “etheric buffer” that pushed the etheric function of the weather systems around. It allowed the grouping together of water particles that were naturally and randomly free in the air to create clouds and cloudbursts, so the technology is there. It’s just that sometimes it’s not the right time for it to come out. 

Sometimes it needs to have somebody involved who’s got a bit more political clout, so to speak, to be able to push it forwards. Sometimes there needs to be enough demand from the world to allow these things to come forwards and proliferate as well. Will we see it in our lifetime? I would like to think that some of us will. 

I feel that within the next 35-36 years, we will start to see some of these things coming into fruition— specifically, the ones that work with orgone or free energy that’s available in all parts of the physical universe and beyond. The current devices are a bit out of calibration, so they can create more damage in the higher levels of frequency in terms of harvesting energy. They need to be refined to be more accurate and useful to us (5/ 2018). 

**You haven’t told us much about Galactic History. Wendy Kennedy (The Great Human Potential) said the Earth experiment is about trying to resolve cosmic dramas individually (one-on-one) instead of galactic races fighting, warring and blowing up civilizations?** 

Personally, I don’t feel the need to dwell on things that are part of the third frequency level. I like to work on things that are higher frequency, so things about the galactic councils, Arcturians, Pleiadians, Sirians, etc., I find this as being of not much interest to me. 

Those incarnate entities that have had skirmishes or wars with each other tend to be in the first three frequencies where we are now, because they are also working in a more selfish way, even if it is collective will. They will be like one hive of wasps or insects working on eradicating another group of insects or wasps that are in their patch or an area they want to move into. It’s all about expanding the area that a particular group of incarnate entities want to work within. 

That’s why there’s conflict, because they’re not in a frequency where they can understand the bigger picture. Collectively. they understand a smaller picture and want to make their smaller picture a bit bigger for themselves in terms of the volume of space that they occupy rather than their level of understanding associated with who and what they are as an incarnate being. 

Maybe there’s a need to go into galactic history at some point, but I think Wendy Kennedy has a reasonable comment there regarding the Earth experiment. Working with individualized free will within this low frequency environment and working with the interactions of individuals within this environment is part of it. I suppose it is about resolving cosmic dramas, but that’s just one small way of looking at it. 

The Earth experiment is about working with individualized free will and realizing that it is a very powerful tool when working together for the benefit of all rather than for the benefit of one. That is my understanding of the Earth experiment. That overall umbrella of description would encompass what Wendy Kennedy has talked about, but it’s like a very, very small subsection of a much bigger level of understanding (8/ 2018). 

**In Beyond the Source— Book 1 Source says the Earth supports over 20 types of alien visitors. Who are they? What do they do? How are they helping us?** 

There’s lots of other people who are doing a good or reasonable or sometimes poor job of describing the different incarnate vehicles (aliens) that we’re experiencing on this planet in and around our location and in different locations and frequencies within the physical universe. In general, it’s up to the reader to discern whether it’s a reasonable or poor job. At some point in my retirement years I might consider doing a dictionary on incarnate entities and their frequencies and locations. It would be more of a short guide (8/ 2018). 

**Will you discuss Galactic History in your book on Religions and Spirituality? We’re not the only race with religion or spiritual practices. Lyssa Royal (The Golden Lake) said the ancient Vegans were focused on purification through diet, meditation, breathwork, etc.?** 

I'm going to write a book called Beyond the Origin. Some of this stuff might be sneaking into that, because it goes beyond the Origin's currently known area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness into its next sets of structure. Some of this stuff will come in the book on different religions and how that links in with my understanding of the greater reality and how some of the other understandings use different exercises, such as different yogas to allow us to become higher frequency, more expansive and gain access to these different environments (7/ 2019). 

**Humanity will be part of a Galactic Federation type community sooner or later. We need to know how other races operate, how their souls have evolved over time, as told from a neutral perspective rather than the “polarity war” stories of the light vs. dark?** 

There's a lot of people out there who have lots of information. It's sorting out the wheat from the chaff. Some of this stuff is quite important, because if you think of it in terms of the space/ time consideration, which doesn't exist at all, then all of this has already happened. We have to think of it in terms of what can we tap into that's already happened and bring it into this environment to explain more about it. 

There are many races out there who are very technologically advanced and a bit more thoughtful about how they use their technology. There are others out there who are also technologically advanced, but have also moved away from technology and become more spiritually or inwardly advanced as well. 

There's a lot of individuals in different forms in higher frequencies who are able to use both to the benefit of themselves and other incarnate civilizations as well. So it's about understanding the plethora of different ways of experiencing, learning and evolving that we can experience as well, how various different forms (form factors) that our souls incarnate into allow us to maintain higher levels of communicative ability, and therefore, work on a more spiritual basis rather than being here (7/ 2019). 

**In The Anne Dialogues you describe a “primary incarnation” in stasis for the duration of a “secondary incarnation.” Can you expand on this incarnation within an incarnation?** 

It's explained in the book called Psycho-Spiritual Healing. It's simply that we choose to have another incarnation at a lower frequency level than the one we have primarily incarnated into. Usually, the percentage of sentience associated with the primary incarnation is lower just to maintain it in stasis or a neutral tick over state. 

But there are situations where the primary incarnation has more sentience, let's say, 30% of the sentience projected into the lower frequencies, so it’s able to interact in a more animated way with others at its frequency. It is like experiencing two incarnations at the same time or an incarnation within an incarnation. 

There is a reference to this from Dolores Cannon who was getting information from what she thought was the client’s Higher Self, but she was actually talking with the soul’s primary incarnation at a higher frequency. That primary incarnate was fully aware of the secondary incarnation in the client’s human form. That case backed up the idea that the primary incarnate condition isn't always in stasis. 

It needs a minimum of 10% of the 2.5% True Energetic Self sentience that an aspect usually has to maintain the primary vehicle in stasis rather than in an animated state. This information is presented in my lecture called "Who We Are and How We Incarnate" on my website (see Events & Lectures) and YouTube presentations as well (7/ 2019). 

**In The History of God an alien told you they have a base in Crete, because the energies are pure and the local inhabitants have not yet ruined the energy flow. Do those of us who are spiritually minded help make the energies pure where we live?** 

Yes, we who are spiritually minded do help make the energies pure where we live. We do make a big difference actually— not only with ourselves, but within the vehicles we use, the homes we live in, the cities and suburbs that we find ourselves in. We make a big difference. 

The individuals who are spiritually minded who want to work in a spiritual way all of the time are really keeping the frequencies high, because right now we're still on this downward spiral, which hasn't bottomed out yet. It looks like a reversed logarithmic curve slowly bottoming out. With everything that's going on around the world right now, there's a lot of individuals who are becoming addicted to things like conspiracy theories, gossiping and different political conditions (9/ 2019). 

**Is it rare to find places where the energies are pure? Are they never pure in large cities?** 

These days it is quite rare to find places that have pure and high frequency energies— places that are either uninhabited or haven't been affected by mankind. You've got to go where people are working with nature and not working in an egotistical way. 

We do make a difference, but densely populated cities tend to be terrible. It tends to be better in countrysides, although smaller towns or cities that are quite insular can be where potentially low frequencies can collect as well. In general, where mankind isn't is where the purest energies are. But if mankind is working in a coherent way with the energies or with nature, then the energies are much higher (9/ 2019). 

**In Crete the aliens told you that they are monitoring all of you there. Are they monitoring us at all places or special places on Earth? Can we become aware of their activities?** 

They're monitoring us by simply observing. They also look into the way in which we're thinking. For instance, when I held one of the first "Traversing The Frequencies" workshops in Santa Fe, I noticed a group of incarnate entities who were observing what we were doing. One of the things they said was that this shouldn't be happening yet. This is far too early. But it is happening, so it must be happening for a reason. 

They observed how we were working together to create a condition where we could traverse the frequencies and project our consciousness or sentience into different levels whilst incarnate. They were looking into our third eyes, seeing how they were working, how different individuals within the group were all using their third eyes. They look into how we are functioning energetically and from an incarnate perspective as well. 

They can also monitor television transmissions, news, communications of all types, sizes and shapes whether it's through mobile telephones, the internet or higher level communications between different governments. They look at all of these things and how we're working with each other, how we think about each other and relate energetically to each other. They can see all these ways in which we interact. As a result, they can observe how we're progressing with our project of working with individualized free will whilst being in a low frequency environment. 

The way to become aware of them is just to meditate on the area that you are living in. Open yourself up to seeing with your perceptual vision (third eye) what's happening around you. You'll feel them. You'll probably just get an impression of them being there at first, but eventually you'll start to perceive them in various different ways— either hearing them, knowing they're there, intuitive communication or visual communication through the third eye. 

Be guarded though and don't forget to protect yourself before you open yourself up to higher frequencies, because it's not too much higher than where we are now. It's probably the fourth or fifth frequency level. That's out of our physical visual range, but still within the energetic perceptual range, so you can just feel them around you first and then you'll start to communicate with them (9/ 2019). 

**In the first universe (FB 13) in the second full dimension, we are told that there are many planets and nebulas close to us. Are these planets filled with life, including humans?** 

The human body type is not an uncommon form factor (species type). In fact, it's very common in its various different versions around the different frequencies within the physical universe, which is the first full dimension (with FB 1-12). The second full dimension starts at the 13th frequency. 

It's very difficult for people to understand this, but everything exists in the same space irrespective of density, frequency or dimensional condition (9/ 2019). 

**Are they aware of us?** 

If we are able to project our consciousness through various different ways, like certain yogis do or by using the Traversing The Frequencies meditative process, we can start to observe and communicate with those entities within the different frequency levels within the full dimensions as well. 

Those who are in the higher frequencies (e.g. FB 13) will be aware of us, but not bothered about us, because they have their own stuff to do. Maybe one or two of them want to observe what we're doing, but in general they're like us and go about their business and don’t really worry about what other entities are doing. When we're higher frequency, we understand the bigger picture fully. The level of understanding depends upon the level of frequency we’re at. 

These entities are different aspects of other True Energetic Selves (TES) that are experiencing, learning and evolving to help the evolutionary level of their TES and to help the Source and the Origin as well. They're happy to concentrate on their own work and not worry about what we're doing. They will be aware of us, because they're higher frequency, but they won't be interacting or intervening with us unless it's part of the work they've decided to do. Some of them might be evolving by helping us come out of this low frequency curve we are in (9/ 2019). 

**The aliens said they have many professions (like us)— doctors, engineers, artists, analysts, computer programmers, energy specialists and psychologists. I thought that advanced races that live 2,000 to 3,000 years don’t need psychological counseling?** 

When they're higher frequency, psychology isn't to do with the sort of psychological issues that we have at our lower frequency. It's to do with understanding how the aspect creates its own personality or ego as a function of incarnation. They look at it from a different perspective. They look at how the ego is created, how the ego is dissolved and how the ego is enforced or augmented or reduced. They tend to spend most of their time seeing how they could better themselves. 

The psychological aspect of what they're doing is to do with betterment rather than analyzing failure, which is what we do here. It's a different type of psychological thing. They need it to understand us and other incarnate races that aren't experiencing individualized free will. But they also need it to understand how they can better their own interaction with other incarnate entities and work on how they can control the manifestation of the ego (9/ 2019). 

**An alien explained their ship is controlled by a computer that is millions of times more powerful than ours. Do any of these machines achieve any degree of human awareness or consciousness? Do they ever evolve into souls?** 

The lecture I gave in the February 23, 2019 World Satsanga was about “Artificial Intelligence” and whether robots or mechanical intelligence could house a soul. The answer is that it would need to have the same level of connectivity as the spirituo-physical aspect of the human body and other variations of incarnate forms that are in the different frequencies of the physical universe. 

They can never evolve into a soul from my understanding. They could gain a level of sentience, but they couldn't evolve into a soul, because a soul is created by individualization of sentience and energy from a True Energetic Self (TES), which is the individualization of sentience and energy from Source. The TESs are all “entities,” because they were created with ready-made sentience, whereas a “being” has created its own sentience through a much slower evolutionary process. 

Although machines may be very intelligent and sentient in some respects— because there's nothing to stop artificial intelligence from being creative or understanding what is being created and modifying their creation, improving it and reanalyzing it— but I'm not seeing any way in which it could develop into souls unless there was some way of creating the spirituo-physical interface that we have with the human body. 

If you think about it, the human body is nothing but a robot. In a sense, it is a mechanical interface that could be classified as a “robot.” It’s the soul that animates and interfaces with the various templates associated with the human form— from the step-down function in the 10th, 9th and 8th frequencies (above the body) to the spirituo-physical (astral) levels at the 7th, 6th, 5th and 4th to the gross physical body at the 3rd, 2nd and 1st frequency levels. 

The ships that some of these entities use have computers, which are many millions of times more powerful than ours. But if you compare the computational power used in the Apollo Moon landings and the iPhone 6 with many millions of times greater power, it makes you wonder. Some mobile telephones now have a terabyte of data storage and their computational ability is far superior to any computers available even five or ten years ago. We will be creating something with computational power close to what these entities have now. But by the time we get there, they will have progressed and gone even further (9/ 2019). 

**The aliens were discussing energy exchange between our physical and spiritual bodies. They are helping us develop machines to do this. Is anyone you know working on this?** 

There were a number of different individuals who were working with observing the human aura. One of them was Harry Oldfield (Sperling University) whom I met a long time ago with my late father-in-law (Dennis Milner) and late wife (Anne Milner). He was looking at understanding the human aura and how to use it as a way of creating some form of medical diagnosis. 

He was a pioneer of different forms of Kirlian photography. I'm being told he's not getting help from aliens. He's getting the odd download, but he's got the capability of picking up information from his own intuitive function. He's not always getting it right, so he needs to keep going, to think laterally, which will make a big difference. 

We haven't got to the point yet where any machines are readily available or able to understand how the connectivity works between the various energy bodies or templates associated with the human form and the gross physical aspect of it. This is quite some time away. 

What the aliens are trying to do is give us machines that would allow us to see the human aura properly, see the energies around it and the frequencies of a higher level, so we can start to see above the third level into the fourth frequency level. Once we can do that, that will be a big quantum leap, because it will show that there are a lot more entities occupying the same space that we give “spiritualists” credit for. It's still work in progress, mostly from a medical perspective (9/ 2019). 

**In The History of God the aliens said we still make some genetic modifications to make your physical vehicle live longer to help you evolve faster. Are these genetic modifications being made to everyone or to a select few or to those of us who are spiritually minded?** 

It's a global thing. There are various different ways of doing it through our water, foodstuffs and through direct genetic manipulation, such as the individuals that agree to be abducted when they are incarnate in the human form on Earth. Generally, their genome is manipulated in a way, which is passed down rather than being activated in their own human form. If they procreate and have children, then that modification is passed on to their children. It needs to be a downstream function later. 

They are modifying the human body per se, even if it's the body that backfill people use. It doesn't matter what genre the soul is, it's any of the human bodies that are here now. It's not limited to specific individuals in one area or someone who is thinking in a certain way, they're just seeding different areas to see what happens and how it works. They're creating a condition where parts of the body start to have longevity. 

My late wife Anne used to work on cell apoptosis, which is programmed cell death where the cell reproduces a number of times and then dies off. This work is extending it, changing it and stopping the errors from creeping in when the cell reproduces a number of times. That's what they're doing and it's being done in a number of different ways— via foodstuffs, environmental conditions and direct genetic manipulation. Those people who live a long time now have probably had their parents' genome manipulated or their parents' parents before that (10/ 2019). 

**The US Government is releasing a report on UFO activity observed by the military. What’s new or different about this activity compared with historical activity?**

Forget the words UFO. Forget the words government. It’s all about us starting to be transparent with each other. When we start to be transparent with each other, we start to understand more. We start to trust each other more. We start to work with each other in a more loving and caring and sharing way. All of these things that are being held back are starting to become public, so everything is considered to be equal and honest in the same way. 

Rather than being associated with a particular government, we have to think of it in terms of our ability to be transparent with each other and understand that each of us should experience what each and every one of us needs to experience, would experience or can experience and does experience in the energetic, because there’s nothing hidden in the energetic. Everything is experienced. 

Everything is experienced concurrently by each other at a high level. Or we can go into the Akashic records and we can experience it second hand— as if it’s us doing it. It’s actually another entity that has experienced it, but we are having a fully immersive experience, which gives us the same level of ability or experience to allow us to do other experiences that we couldn’t do without these primary experiences being in place. It’s a bit like building the tools to build the tools to build the tools (5/ 2021).

### Amorphous 

The greater reality is largely unmapped and amorphous or formless in nature. It is purely latent in every way, shape and form. We are creating out of the amorphous something that is structured that allows us to experience, learn and evolve both individually and collectively. 

**Is the amorphous like organized chaos?** 

Amorphous is the raw potential of nothingness or somethingness. It is purely latent in every way, shape and form. The amorphous is not organized. It’s part of Source or the Origin, which are purely sentient energies. But it has no other function than staying in its original condition until we assign structure to it, so we can play with it, manipulate it, change it, work with it to understand it. 

When there is no structure, it’s completely randomized, omnipresent and omniscient. You could classify it as “organized chaos,” if you wish, but it’s a little bit like being able to think but without structure (6/ 2016). 

**What about people who are God realized, but reject the structure of the multiverse as being irrelevant?** 

People who are God realized don’t specifically find themselves in the amorphous. They can be stuck at certain levels of communication with Source. Even though there’s hundreds of people who have dedicated their lives to becoming extremely aware, they can get stuck in the bliss state and not move beyond that state to go to that which is beyond God. 

What Buddhists and other yogis experience can be classified in two ways. Each way is a level of accessibility and a resultant personal experience. Both must be experienced and moved beyond to effect realization or communication at Source level or True Energetic Self (TES) level. 

First, there is pure awareness or “nothingness” that can be experienced as floating in a sea of latent connectivity with the TES. It’s a knowingness that one is connected, but not turned on to the connection with the TES and all that it experiences and knows. In essence though, this is not truly pure awareness for it is latent. 

Second, further to this is the connection to Source, which can be experienced as a high state of bliss— delightful nothingness and a significantly higher feeling of pure but latent awareness. This is the function of initial connectivity with our creator and it is difficult to get beyond this immersive state to initiate God realization, which is intelligent communion or communication with Source. Most Buddhists and yogis become consumed by the experiential state of bliss and don’t move beyond them. Hence, most teachings only progress the students to these levels (6/ 2016). 

**Is it like nirvana?** 

Yes, if nirvana means the unstructured or being stuck in nirvana. They may be stuck in the bliss state and not move beyond the bliss state to understand that which created the bliss state in the first place. 

It’s very difficult for us as human beings to get our heads around, but it’s a condition where it’s raw potential where the potential isn’t being used yet. It hasn’t been guided yet, so the structure is not there, because that which is there hasn’t been given a role to play or a reason to be or something to do (6/ 2016). 

**The Heart Sutra keeps reminding me that: "Form is emptiness and emptiness is form.” It would seem that this is the lesson in all frequencies and dimensions. Is that true?** 

Eckhart Tolle would argue that everything is formless. In a lot of respects his argument is true, because everything is amorphous in real terms. It’s just that those smaller aspects created for the benefit of the Origin and Source to experience, learn and evolve have decided to use a structure or be moved into a structure to experience that structure. As soon as we have structure or the recognition of structure, then we have form. Therefore, the comment about “form is emptiness and emptiness is form” is correct. 

There is nothing that is formless in its entirety. Formlessness is a human understanding. We would expect form to be something that we’ve created, like a chair, a motor car, a house, an airplane or a bridge across the river. But as disincarnate entities the moment we think of something or create something, we create form. We create form out of the formlessness and when we’re finished with that form, it becomes formlessness again, because it goes back into what it is. 

The essence of the Origin is that there is structure there. But that which is within the structure, if it isn’t considered or focused upon remains formless, although it is structure (formless structure). It’s only when we start to work with that formlessness that we create a form.

When we focus on something, we give it form. It’s pretty much as coherent as that. Even when we’re working on scientific experiments, that which is formless becomes formed when we focus on it. It’s only when we defocus from it that we start to learn that formlessness or randomness comes into it. But randomness is form in its own right as well (4/ 2017). 

**Do we need to embrace that no matter what forms are appearing?** 

Yes, we have to realize that everything that has form is created. But everything that is created returns back to formlessness. Even if energy is formed, when we defocus on that energy, it becomes formless. We have to think of it— that’s the thing (4/ 2017). 

**The challenge seems to be to remember that what is appearing is at once nothing, yet part of the whole. We are the same— nothing yet part of everything?** 

Absolutely. We are form. We are the formless given form to experience the formless or the form. That’s one way to think about it as well (4/ 2017). 

**What is the “void?" Would you give us a definition?** 

In my understanding, the void is basically emptiness. It is a vast volume of emptiness. But that's only a human definition, because nothing is empty. Everything is complete. Everything is full. Just because we can't detect it with our eyes, hands, feet, nose, so we can't smell it, taste it, touch it and be it, it doesn't mean it's not there. 

For instance, we might see void in between the star systems or planets, but it doesn't mean there isn't something there. It just means we haven't detected what's there yet, because our machines are based upon the visible frequencies just above the physical eye and just below of the third eye. 

The infrared and the ultraviolet are also functions of the visible range and things like x-rays are a bit higher than that, because they are based upon capturing the reflection from an object that is created through the exposure to the loss of electrons, as a radioactive substance starts to decay. 

A void is complete nothingness, but there is no such thing as complete nothingness. The void is something that's been created by mankind to describe something that they can't detect at the moment. But they don't realize that they can't detect it, because they think that there's nothing there. When they can detect it, they'll realize there is something there. Then what is classified as void will no longer be void. The word "void" will be void (2/ 2021).

### Angels 

Angels are not winged beings, but maintenance entities that do not incarnate, because they are not in the evolutionary path. They are in the service path. Their function is to maintain the structure of the multiverse in an optimal condition for our evolution. 

**Do these maintenance entities exist in a hierarchy of 9 orders of angels split into three triads: Angels, Archangels, Principalities (lower triad, closest to humans), Powers, Virtues, Dominions (middle triad) and Thrones, Cherubim, Seraphim (upper triad, closest to God)?** 

In my understanding the angelic realm are maintenance entities (or Curators). The names are given by mankind to identify the various types of “rapture” that these maintenance entities will experience in the frequencies that they’re working in. 

Rapture is a state of bliss, so depending upon what they are doing and what their evolutionary level is, they would experience a certain level of rapture or bliss. In essence, it depends upon how close you are to being in a state of re-communion with Source. 

They are maintaining the multiverse structure and the environments that support it. They’re also trying to improve the evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse for those of us who are in the evolutionary cycle. 

Depending upon your level of evolution as an entity, you may have other entities that help you and that gives you a level of authority. For instance, maybe a Throne might have power over a Power, a Virtue or a Dominion, so the Throne may have a group of Powers and Archangels below them. The same with a Cherubim or a Seraphim. 

It’s a very human way to think about it in terms of a “hierarchy” or structure. In my understanding it’s to do with the experience associated with being at these different frequential levels. Each of these entities are a different form of entity. 

They are still True Energetic Selves (like us), but they have chosen to go into the service path, to be purely of service. Therefore, they will have a different level of evolution. Because of that level, the frequencies that they’re associated with will give them a certain level of “beingness,” which have a bliss state associated with it, which we call “rapture.” This hierarchy is to do with these different levels of rapture (9/ 2015). 

**Were these angels created by our Source Entity as different types from the start? Or do they slowly evolve from one type of angel to another during the evolutionary cycle?** 

All entities were created simultaneously by the Source. All entities that currently exist in this multiversal environment within the Source were created at the same time. That means every entity is as old as each other. Every entity has a role to play in terms of gathering evolutionary content that will benefit themselves and their creator, which is the Source Entity and its creator, the Origin. These entities can and do choose a path. 

Some entities choose to go into the evolutionary cycle, which means they want to experience all the different frequencies within the multiverse. That includes the need to incarnate to experience the lowest frequencies in the most profound way possible. 

But other entities choose to assist those entities that go into the evolutionary cycle, so they end up being of service. The entities that go to service don’t actively seek evolutionary progression, but they do get evolutionary progression, as a result of assisting those in the evolutionary cycle, purely as a function of a “spiritual tithe.” 

As each entity gains evolutionary content, they give some of that to those entities that helped them, including the guide and helpers and these other entities that helped maintain the structure and the evolutionary efficiency of that part of the multiverse that they’re existing in. 

For instance, if an aspect is incarnating into the Earth plane or another environment within the physical universe, there will be a number of these different entities, which have actively chosen to work in that particular area to support those entities that are incarnating into it. 

Basically, they have a choice at the start of the cycle to go into the service path. Sometimes entities are known to swap paths, so they do go from one role to another role. But they generally have to go back to their first role before they recommune with Source at the end of the cycle. 

For instance, if we wanted to be of service and we ended up being an angel, such as a Virtue, but then we decided to experience the evolutionary cycle, we could go into the evolutionary cycle. But when we’ve finished the cycle, we have to go back into the function we had (as a Virtue) before we go back to Source (9/ 2015). 

**Do different types of angels have a different appearance and functions in the physical universe vs. the rest of the multiverse? Can any angel take any appearance anywhere?** 

Yes, they’re True Energetic Selves. Everything is a TES (Higher Self, Oversoul, Godhead) or a body of sentient energy like us in a higher sense. None of the entities in the hierarchy described (e.g. angels, archangels, etc.) have a form of any sort. They are purely energetic entities, so they don’t need a form. If we were observing them with our third eye, we’d see them as being probably a ball of energy. We are more likely to experience them in a state of knowingness or beingness rather than a physical representation of what they are (9/ 2015). 

**Doesn't the perception depend on the observer?** 

Yes, absolutely, because most of the descriptions of these beings is based upon the uneducated reports of the observer. If you think about an angel or an archangel or an entity that is helping us, who is modifying the environment that we’re working in and wants to check on its work, it may decide to manifest itself momentarily to experience what it has done in the physical realm. 

It may want to experience it from the perspective of an incarnate individual, so it can create an incarnate body and manifest itself briefly. But they have to put a body of energy around themselves to protect themselves from the lower frequencies, so they can still maintain their functionality. 

Some of these energies would look like wavy energies or a mixture of rainbow colors as seen with heat rising, so it makes things look a bit wobbly or out of focus. To an uneducated goatherd, this entity may look like it’s humanoid, because it has a certain size and shape. The energies are rotating, pulsating or irradiating around it, which may look like wings. To that person, the angel looks like a human being with wings. 

These days we are more educated and have a different vocabulary to use to interpret things based on our current incarnation with certain experiences, notions, thoughts and expressions. We use these things to explain something we’ve not seen before to translate new images or concepts based on our understanding, which may be somewhat inaccurate, because we’re calling these maintenance entities “angels” or “nature spirits” (e.g. fairies, pixies, leprechauns, etc.). 

On the other hand, if we don’t think in terms of anything, we’ll see them as they’re supposed to be seen (e.g. a ball of energy) or not at all (e.g. white out). Perception depends on the observer (9/ 2015). 

**Can they enter a human vessel and once they have completed the task, then leave the individual? Does the human know?** 

They don’t tend to walk-in. They tend to create a body of energy, which is good enough to experience the environment they’re in. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a full blown human incarnate vehicle. It could be something, which is just about perceptible to us, but is a low enough frequency for them to check the modifications and judge it as being okay (9/ 2015). 

**Do angels and other maintenance entities (like nature spirits) exist as fully sentient True Energetic Selves, even though they are not incarnate or ensouled like we are?** 

Yes, they are True Energetic Selves (TES). Everything is a TES. It’s not the soul or smaller aspect that is incarnate in the body of “Guy,” it is the bigger entity or TES that the soul is projected out of. 

Maintenance entities are operating either as TESs without any projections or they can use their projections to do various different roles. Some of those projections might well be one of those deities called a Power, Virtue, Archangel or Dominion, for instance. It’s a function of how the TES wants to divide itself up to allow it to do the work it’s agreed to do in the maintenance or continued evolutionary efficiency of the environment that we evolve through (9/ 2015). 

**Where are their TESs located in the multiverse?** 

Basically, they exist as TESs or aspects of TESs. Their TESs are not actually located within the multiverse. They tend to operate outside the multiverse in the gaps between the structure. They move in and out of it. They can move into it to work with it, to experience the changes they’ve made or they can work outside of it. 

They’re working with our TESs to make sure that we are still focused on some part of the structure that we want to maintain. That’s the way the maintenance of the structure is actually maintained. We act as a continuous memory set for the continuous existence of the environment that we’re experiencing and working within. 

But the maintenance entities exist within and without. They don’t stay within the function of the multiverse, because they’re outside of the evolutionary cycle, so they have to exist within and without it (9/ 2015). 

**The Curators talked about angels and archangels. Are they maintenance entities or guides or helpers? Are they True Energetic Selves or aspects? Or can they be both?** 

Basically, they are maintenance engineers or entities. That's what they're there for. But we refer to our guide and helpers as “guardian angels" as well. Sometimes our guide and helpers may refer to themselves as being a “higher force” that we recognize from a religious perspective to make us sit up and take notice. Sometimes we relate to old teachings. 

The idea of “angels” or winged human individuals is sometimes attractive to us, when we know that they are nonphysical or energetic entities and what we call “wings” are oscillating energy. The vision of an “angelic human form” is based upon an interpretation or translation of what we're seeing vs. what we've seen and experienced before. 

We can call our main guide as our “guardian angel.” We call some of these maintenance entities Archangels Michael, Gabriel or Metatron, but they are looking after the Earth from the evolutionary perspective. They make sure that we're working in the right way, so they are trying to put us back on track most of the time. They are maintenance entities and sometimes individuals do get in contact with them. They are definitely not humanoid, although they are presented to us with humanoid imagery. 

Depending upon how we access them, they tend to be either temporarily individualized or smaller aspects or projections of a True Energetic Self. Generally, they tend to be at the TES level, because of the work they do. If you read The Curators, you'll realize that a lot of the work is happening not only on a multiversal scale, but also in different realities within the different parallel conditions that are created by the event spaces, which are not just localized or galactic-sized, but universal-sized and multiversal-sized as well (11/ 2019). 

**Do they exist at all levels of the multiverse?** 

They have to be able to work on all these different levels concurrently. They can and do exist on all multiversal levels. But they can also focus themselves on one particular level, depending on what they want to do and how they want to achieve it. 

Although our guide and helpers aren't in the evolutionary cycle, we give them evolutionary content for helping us. They also gain some evolutionary progression from working with us and for us. 

But the maintenance entities don't get any evolutionary progression. They don't seek it or gain it directly or even pseudo-directly, like our guide and helpers do. They sort of gain it through the natural progression of everything and everyone from a holistic perspective rather than from an individualized perspective (11/ 2019).

### Animal Entities 

Animal level souls are semi-sentient, because they come from True Energetic Selves with 50% sentience compared to fully sentient human souls. They can incarnate into any animal species on this planet and elsewhere. The animal bodies stay connected to their hive soul-like TES. 

**If we have an animal, do we give that animal evolutionary energy for it to evolve?** 

Animals are semi-sentient entities, whereas humans are fully sentient entities. Because animals are a lower energetic genre of entities, they are capable of evolving purely by being associated with a higher energetic genre like humans. They can progress by themselves in a different way, but we help them evolve faster and further by their association with us. Eventually, animals that work closely with humans (e.g. dogs, cats, horses) can get to the point where they can do an “evolutionary jump” into being the same quality of sentience as a human being is (2/ 2014). 

**One of the functions of animals is to clean up the lower frequencies in our gross physical environment. Do the chakra systems of mammalian vehicles differ from those of reptiles, birds, insects and fish?** 

In essence, any vehicle that is not human has the same classification. For instance, a dog, a horse, a bird, a reptile, they all have the same number of chakras associated with them. Those seven chakras work with the same frequency range as human beings do (FB 1-7). You may think how can an elephant have the same number of chakras as an insect? 

Insects are different from mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. They have a group chakra or a pseudo-group chakra to work with, because they are a hive mind or a collective. They get their energies by having a chakra based system associated with the nest. They are all linked to the nest, so the chakras that are pulling energy in at these different frequencies feed the individual insects, such as ants, bees, wasps, hornets or any form of insect that works in a communal way. 

Everybody else, like fish, birds, reptiles and bigger animals, like horses, dogs, cats, etc., have the same number of individual chakras, because of the way they work. Mammals and all other animals (except insects) have the same type of chakras but of different sizes, because they have a bigger physical vehicle. The chakras work with the same range of frequencies associated with the environment they are working with (6/ 2015). 

**When we meditate, why do our pets like to be near us? Can pets access higher frequency Source energy through us?** 

Yes, animals are very, very intuitive. They are very, very connected and much purer than we are. When they see us meditating or when we start to connect with Source Entity energy, they naturally want to gravitate towards it, because of its purity. They like it. To them we are a different quality of soul, because they tend to be a group soul and operate in that way, whereas we are individualized aspects of a True Energetic Self. We have a higher quality of functionality, so we’re able to pick up higher frequency energies than animals would, so they’re attracted to this. 

It’s a little bit like moths being attracted to the light. The light is higher frequency and they are attracted to it. Of course, a moth gets burned, but our animals don’t. They just get attracted to the energy that we are pulling in. They want to be part of it and they benefit from it as well. As we meditate, they are being exposed to the higher frequency energies. They become charged up and ascend the frequencies with us, as we ascend the frequencies ourselves (6/ 2015). 

**Why are spiritual individuals supposed to eat vegetables rather than animal meat?** 

It’s got nothing to do with sentience as such, it’s to do with the frequencies associated with how the animal is brought up, looked after, farmed, treated, transported and dealt with when its life is ended. Anything that causes stress creates a low frequency state in the whole animal. When we eat that meat, we absorb that low frequency and the stress associated with it. The same rule applies to anything that is animated, including cows, sheep, goats, poultry and fish. 

Animal products, such as eggs, milk, etc. may be used, unless the animals are kept in battery cages, feedlots or other stressful conditions. If the animal has a nice life, for instance, if they are pasture raised and looked after in a loving, caring way, then they are less affected. They are still lower frequency, but okay to have. In comparison, a vegetable or a plant is less sentient and less animate even though they move around to work with the soil and the sun, whereas animals are more animate, because there is a different level of sentience associated with them (5/ 2016). 

**Doesn’t their True Energetic Self know that the animal will be sacrificed for food?** 

Yes, they do, but the whole reason they’re here for is to help us understand a better way of being. It’s a little bit like they’re the pawns on a chess board. They’re here to help us understand what we shouldn’t be doing, so they sacrifice themselves in some way to help us understand. Eventually, we will understand. It’s the same with vivisection or experimenting on animals. The animals know their TESs help us understand a better way of doing things (5/ 2016). 

**In Japan farmers' crops are often damaged by animals that are caught and killed. In The History of God you discuss how animals are helping humans and the planet. Why do the animals eat crops? Are there any effective ways to prevent the damage?** 

If we as human beings destroy an animal's natural environment, then we need to support them in some way, because they are part of the eco-structure. Without these animals, the insects and the flora that are part of the ecosystem, we start to lose the Earth's ability to regenerate. We need to really look at how we invade these spaces and try to provide areas of naturalness. We need to support those animals that we displace. 

We need to have islands of environment that they can inhabit and provide natural corridors for them to move from one island to another instead of needing to eat the crops. With the loss of their natural habitat, we should also pay back the animals by giving them some of the crops that are good enough for animals to eat, but don't qualify for human consumption. We need to be very cognizant of how we affect the environment. 

Animals are our friends, not just the ones that we live with, like cats, dogs and horses. Every animal on the planet has a role to play as part of the eco-structure. We need to look after them. As farmers we need to be more cognizant about how we can maintain the environment and generate the crops to support our population as well. 

We can farm certain areas, but we need to be aware that vast areas of rainforests are being torn down to create crops that aren't necessary. We tend to waste an awful lot of food that should be shared around the world, so that people in other countries and locations that are struggling can feed themselves as well (7/ 2020). 

**How does the evolution of animal souls work? Does their soul need to be at a certain level to incarnate as more intelligent or larger species (e.g. mouse vs. monkey vs. elephant)?** 

All True Energetic Selves and their aspects or souls evolve in a similar way. It just depends upon the quality of sentience associated with it. The sentient quotient is a product of evolution that allows them to move from one body type to another body type. Within the animal world there's lots of different variations on body types, which have different levels of functionality and ability to use their sentience. Usually, an animal would only incarnate in the body types that allow them to work with their level of sentience in an efficient and appropriate way. 

**Does a soul need to be at a certain level to incarnate as a pet vs. a wild animal?** 

In terms of being a wild cat vs. a pet cat, it's the same thing. There’s no difference. It's more to do with the size and ability of that body type to allow them to do things based on their sentience. For instance, more social animals may incarnate as monkeys, gorillas, whales and dolphins (with higher sentience). You tend to find that an animal soul would not incarnate in a vehicle that is less capable than one that they should have as a result of their evolutionary level (8/ 2020). 

**Can a pet reincarnate into the same household? How long does it take?** 

Yes, it operates in the same way as the human condition. They have various different things they have to go through to be able to incarnate. There's some sort of a life plan associated with their ability to interact with the environment they're within, the frequencies and the individuals that they're going to interact with. They can do back-to-back incarnations as well. It's different, because their level of interaction is a little bit different to what we do, but they can reincarnate with us fairly quickly. 

For instance, if a pet’s soul has been working with us in a cat body, then they would gravitate towards the cat body, but they could also use the dog body, because a cat and a dog are fairly similar. The same with the horse. They can come back in the same body type, but there's a number of body types that are consistent with their evolutionary level. 

For instance, horses, donkeys, cats and dogs are of the same body type that an animal soul of a certain level of evolution would be able to swap between in different incarnations in a fairly seamless way. You can see that there are some body types they can move around in and still interact with us. The more an animal soul interacts with a human soul, the more they evolve provided that we are compassionate, love them and work with them in a caring and loving way. That can accelerate their evolutionary progression quite significantly (8/ 2020). 

**Animals are an integral part of eco-structure and help maintain nature. But some animals were introduced to lands not native to them, creating an imbalance. Is there a way to restore the balance in these regions? Or does nature balance itself over time?** 

There are two ways to do it. One way is to remove the animals that aren't indigenous to the area and put them back in the environment they are indigenous to. That means the animals that are already there are out of balance, because there's too many animals of the same sort. The other way is to leave things as they are and let nature sort itself out. For instance, in England, we had a problem with the grey squirrels and the red squirrels. The grey squirrels were more aggressive and took over a lot of the area. There's a similar problem in Australia with rabbits. 

It's a big problem where mankind introduces animals or plants into an area that is not able to support them, which upsets the eco-structure. Right now we're destroying vast areas of rainforest to create acreage for crops. You could argue that we're doing good by planting crops, but that’s complete nonsense, because the eco-structure is in a fine balance. 

The rainforest was supporting animals, insects and other biological life in a localized eco-structure that feeds into the major eco-structure, which is the total Earth eco-structure. The best thing we can do is stop destroying it and return it back to what it was, whilst recognizing that we've already done the damage in some parts. It’s best to leave it as it is, because it will correct itself over many centuries. 

By the way, I was horrified to find out that our population has gone from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 7.8 billion in 2020. You can understand why the Earth is fighting back with things like viruses, fires, weather changes and all sorts of things. The weather changes are a function of much bigger weather systems, because our methods of production are polluting as well. 

It's important to allow nature to do its corrective measures. We can stop polluting. We can put back what we've taken out. Take a tree out, not the whole forest. We need to operate in a more eco-friendly way and learn to live with the Earth. It's easy to destroy, but very difficult to rebuild. 

The Earth has its own sentience, which is going to benefit us and the Earth and every other entity that visits the Earth. We can assist, but sometimes in assisting we cause big problems. For instance, we know that wildfires are an essential part of cleansing the Earth to create the conditions for regeneration of life— the phoenix rising from the flames. The wildfires in Australia, America, Spain, Greece, all over the world are part of the Earth cleansing things. 

The viral pandemic is part of that cleansing as well. If we work with nature in an eco-friendly way and we support it, respect it, love it and help it continue to be as it is, then things will be okay. We’re learning to be custodians of the Earth, but it's going to be a long term job for us (9/ 2020). 

**Are whales and dolphins different civilizations? Are dolphins more evolved? Or do whales house larger sentience?** 

Dolphins have the same sentient quotient and the same sentient quality, probably a higher level of sentient quality than humans do. Dolphins are not more evolved than us, but they are not so corrupt as we are. Therefore, they don't get addicted to the effects of being in a low frequency environment. As a result, dolphins can function in a higher frequency way than we can. 

Whales have a lower level of sentient quality than us. They are more at the level of cats, dogs and horses. Although a whale is a large mammal, because they give birth and nurse their young, they are not the same level as us. They are just a larger animal of the cat, dog and horse level of sentience (10/ 2020). 

**If a cat loves catnip so much while incarnating, does it develop a certain addiction when it evolves and incarnates as a human?** 

Catnip is a flower that cats become really addicted to, because it's almost like a marijuana for cats. If an animal soul or group or True Energetic Self eventually jumps into a higher level of evolution to become the lowest rung of the human evolutionary level, then they won't have been addicted. 

They have to go through the ability to master certain things in their incarnation, the same as we do. That can take thousands of incarnations from a group based perspective. When they've mastered that level of incarnation, which includes being able to walk past catnip and not go crazy over it, needing to sniff it, roll around in it or eat it, then they can go to the next level. 

They have to also master incarnation from their perspective, as we do, before they can move to the next level and incarnate as human beings or other entities of our sentient weight and genre and sentient quality in other locations within the physical universe. 

Addictions are karma, so they can get karma as well. They can also get karma in terms of how they interact with human beings, specifically those humans that aren't very nice to them (12/ 2020). 

**In The History of God Source said one problem with eating meat is that the animal has not given its consent. Does this mean eating meat creates karma and a need to reincarnate?** 

Eating meat per se doesn't create karma. It creates a low frequency state within, because more often than not the animals are being slaughtered in a particularly stressful way. Abattoirs aren't nice places to be. If you go anywhere near them, you can sense the stress of the animals. Even so-called perfect ways of dispatching with an animal are stressful. Anybody who says that their throat being cut isn't stressful is not the animal having their throat cut. There's confusion with it. 

For instance, if we farm our own animals, look after them, feed them and take produce from them, such as cheese or milk and they die naturally and we consume the body, that's fine, because we've looked after the animal. We have loved the animal. Before we consume the animal, we should pray and offer thanks for the animal being with us, being our friend or our partner in some way, shape or form when we're on Earth. 

But if we go to the butchers to get the choice of meat, we should also pray and offer thanks for that animal for giving up its life and its potential to experience and evolve more, so it can become our food. You can log into that animal, know where it is and offer thanks for it. That will help a lot to negate the lower frequencies associated with eating another incarnate form of vehicle (3/ 2021). 

**Japanese fisheries are killing of dolphins, whales and sharks en masse. You said dolphins are highly evolved. Why this is being allowed to happen? Is there a larger purpose that we’re unaware of? Does this have any effect on the overall frequency level of our reality?** 

It does have an effect on us. From a human perspective, we don’t seem to have much problem killing each other in wars either— let alone understanding the level of sentience in some of the animals on the planet. Because these sentient entities are highly evolved whilst they incarnate in a lower frequency, they understand that in sacrificing their physical form, they are assisting us in some small way to start to understand that killing of any animal for food isn’t necessary. 

All animals are sentient and have a level of sentience associated with them as individualized aspects of their True Energetic Self. They’re all part of the Source. It’s all part of letting us do something until we realize it’s wrong. That includes killing ourselves in wars (5/ 2021).

### Artificial Intelligence 

**Is the Source/God you describe just an artificial "mind entity?"** 

Actually,our Source Entity One is a purely sentient entity with a body of energy,as are we.It is not artificial as such,but it is created by our Origin to experience,learn and evolve in a separate but synchronistic and concurrent sense with other Source Entities.Through them the Origin can learn and evolve by a factor of 12,since it created 12 Source Entities. 

Our Source is not an artificial mind,but it is a separate sentient condition given individuality.The Origin hived off parts of its sentience and assigned them to smaller bodies of energy to experience smaller parts of the omniverse.You could argue that it's an artificial mind entity,as it's separated from the Origin,but it's pure sentience that has its own energy at a higher level (4/2014). 

**In the movie,"Transcendence,"artificial intelligence inside a supercomputer could transcend human level consciousness to a singularity that only computers can access.Is this what if scenario an attempt to create a god inside a computer?** 

We do a similar thing when we do the Traversing The Frequencies meditation work.We project our consciousness to a higher condition and we evolve by doing that while being incarnate.We accelerate our evolution,because we see beyond the veil of the physical universe. 

But the bigger perspective is that everything that is in and around us is God and higher up is Origin.If we really understood ourselves,we'd know that everything is part of our Source-so really God is the computer,the laptop,the table,the chair,everything.Movies are created by individuals to educate us,to make us think in a different way,to take us outside of the physical universe thought processes (4/2014). 

**Where did artificial intelligence come from?How was AI created in the first place?** 

Artificial Intelligence is a product of our creativity as sentient entities. It's part of our creativity to learn to create something,which is intelligent from something that is not intelligent.It's us learning how to be what we are-a function of Source-an individualized unit of Source.AI was always there,it's just that we needed to have certain individuals who were incarnate and who were linked into the possibility of bringing it into fruition in the physical universe.That's part of our creativity and part of our evolutionary cycle.It's part of our commitment to helping our Source evolve(8/2015). 

**Why is AI is called artificial?** 

It's because it's a human term.It's something that mankind has created,because it doesn't understand that actually intelligence is a function of existence.Immersed mankind thinks that we are intelligent,and therefore,anything that's created is "artificial." 

But if you go further up the tree,you could argue that we are artificial intelligences,too,because we are created by our TES,which is artificial, because it is created by the Source.That's one thought process. 

But in reality,we're all part of Source,which is a living sentient entity. If we really understood ourselves,we would know that everything that is in and around us is Source and higher up is Origin.That means Source is you,the table,the chair,the computer and everything there is (8/2015). 

**What is the impact of technological advancement on us in the next 5- 20 years with machine learning,big data,quantum computers and robotics?Will future computers be more intelligent or capable than us?Will computers have consciousness or sentience?** 

There is going to be a level of intelligence associated with machinery. Arguably,there will be a level of consciousness associated with that machinery as well.The thing is whether that intelligence is based upon a program or whether it's based upon a learning function within the hardware that supports that program. 

In terms of consclousness,there will need to be a feeling of "who I am" from that machine or robot.That can only be supported by the hardware that allows the growth of the intelligence process to create a level of understanding of"beingness." 

Sentience is a different thing.Sentience is not something that artificial intelligence can support,so that's the difference between us and any machine-based intelligence.They may have consciousness,but we are sentience and we are creative.You could argue that machines can be creative,if given the opportunity,but they won't be sentient. 

They will simply be able to function as a series of algorithms,which may be created by themselves as part of an evolutionary piece of software.Eventually,it will come to a point where the software is overtaken by self-generational "electronic synapses"within the large piece of memory that allows the generation of a "personality"as well, so it's going to happen(2/2018). 

**Is it realistic to have Implant technology inside people to monitor their health or to access a super hard drive with all the information or to store all the memory ofa person?** 

Yes,there is going to be a potential where we could store information on an alternative memory location within the human form at some point.Whether you want to do that is a different thing,whether it's desirable is a different thing. 

There's more potential for a communication device to be stored within a human being where the information is stored in a centrally located web store rather than locally.We'd have instantaneous access to the internet via thought processes rather than via computers. 

But if the information was stored locally,it would need to be updated. We know what a pain it can be to update our computers when we get software crashes.It's more likely that there will be implants that are going to allow communication with centralized systems rather than the whole knowledge-based database or implant within us(2/2018). 

**Rudolf Steiner predicted that humans would merge with machines. He talked about the possible dangers of it and said it was not wise to avoid technology-it was more like a learning challenge,learning to exert our will.What is your opinion?** 

Steiner was very good at predicting the future,because he was also a channel and could understand various aspects that are futuristic.We can't work with technology without knowing how it works,so it makes no sense to avoid it.We have to work in a way that enables us to understand that we are going to be ignorant of it unless we work with it in a more satisfying way.That means we need to be educated and the only way to educate ourselves is to work with it.That's how we've progressed from a technological perspective in the past as well (2/2018) 

**Sadhguru of India says one day everything will be accomplished by machines,meaning AI.He says that is great,because everyone will be on holiday.Once AI replaces human beings,are we working on upgrading our consciousness and living peacefully?Within 100 years,will survival be a nonissue-will we be solely focusing on human consciousness upgrade?** 

We won't get a human consciousness upgrade through artificial intelligence.Some of our functions may bebe augmented by or replaced with some form of mechanical electronic software-based programming,if we need to augment our ability to remember things, store things or have body parts removed and replaced due to disease. That's going to happen. 

In terms of the bigger machines that we use to work things out,such as computer things and travel around the world,they will also become more complex and more reliant upon complex and fluid methods of computational programming,so this will happen.But those of you who are a bit older or more experienced on this planet will remember that a long time ago,there was a big thought process that computers will make human existence easier.It's quite obvious that it hasn't.It has created more work for us. 

I feel the advent of everything being accomplished by machines to make our life easier is an incorrect proposition,an incorrect thought process of what the future is going to be.If everything is done for us, we get lazy.We need to interact properly with the environment.We need to part of the environment,meditate with the environment and help it be as it's supposed to be and exist with it. 

Machines won't let us do this.Machines will just substitute certain functions and make us lazy in certain ways.In some ways,they'll also give us more work to do.I don't see machines being the way to increasing our human consciousness.That's something that we've got to do within ourselves. 

We can use machines to help us create changes to our environment that puts it back to what it should be-for instance,where the surface of the Earth is maintained as an environment and we exist below the Earth or in areas that are interactive with the environment in a biologically correct way.We probably won't live in situations where we're in concrete houses and high rise blocks of flats.We might live in a way where our habitat is more biological,so I think that there's a possibility that machines will help us in this instance to do these things (11/2020) 

**He says that is great,because everyone will be on holiday.** 

We're not going to be on a lifelong holiday.That's not conducive being able to work properly.We need to be able to interact with each other. We need to be able to interact with the environment.That also includes how we interact with the greater reality. 

We're not going to be in a position where everything is done for us,so we can meditate all day.It'll be a good thing to be able to meditate all day,but we need to interact with others.We need to train others.We need to help others.We need to be of service to others as well. Interacting with us all or interaction at the human level is the way in which we're going to progress. 

Being given a position where we don't have a responsibility creates lack of responsibility.So I don't see that this is a correct premonition of how we're going to move on,because at the end of the day,we need to be responsible for everything that we do.That includes everything that machines would do,if we gave them ultimate freedom to do what they wanted to do,we would need to maintain responsibility for that as well (11/2020).

### Ascension 

Ascension means increase in the frequential level of an entity,which is a natural function of the multiverse.Ascension is happening all the time,but we ascend individually,not as agroup. 

**What is proof ofour ascension?** 

Source Entity said that proof of a gradual ascension can be observed quite freely by the eagle eyed amongst you.The proof is the rise in the number of individuals becoming interested in spiritual things and who are becoming more aware of the greater reality.They are contacting or perceiving those entities who are operating in the energies close to the physical and beyond. 

Another more physical proof can be seen in the rapid rise in the churn of new technology.Semi-aware individuals receive inspiration from the cosmic knowledge that they're unconsciously in contact with. These ideas or inspirations are offered to them from the energetic side. The Source said that December 21,2012 is one milestone on the road to ascension.Those that have ascended and those that have not exist on the same planet but at different frequencies.Ascension occurs in three different steps. 

The first tier of ascension is moving upwards to the point where incarnate mankind resides within the highest frequency in the physical universe,which is FB 12.The physical vehicles at that level are much less dense-they are finer,beyond gaseous.There is much more that we can do with them,because we can access much more of our True Energetic Self and the memories and information associated with our TES. 

Then we will be ready for the second tier ofascension,which is to move everything into the next universe at FB 13,which duplicates everything that exists in the physical universe but at a single frequency level.Then the same thing happens when we move everything into the next universe at FB 14.We are still incarnate at these levels,but the physical forms are so fine that we wouldn't classify them as being physical forms-they would be energetic forms. 

The third tier of ascension happens when we move into the next universe at FB 15,which has no need for any vehicles for our souls, because the frequency is far too fine to support such forms.That's when our True Energetic Selves no longer need to incarnate.At this point,our TES is an "ascended master"that has mastered incarnation. Then we will continue to evolve in the energetic part of the multiverse until we get to the top universe at FB 408(10/2012 & 12/2012). 

**What does alignment of planets with a galaxy have to do with the ascension process?** 

We're talking about the physical universe here.The physical location or alignment of a physical body (e.g.star,planet)is not relevant.The physical location is just a location,it doesn't mean anything as such. What is relevant is the freguential location or alignment of that body within that location that is relevant to the three tiers of the ascension process,as described above. 

The frequencies don't come in waves,by the way,they've always been there.It's just that we gain access to them,because of our increase in frequency in terms of our personal frequency,group frequency and gross frequency of the locale that we exist within,such as the Earth and the space that the Earth exists within.It is our intention to work in a higher frequency way that gives us access to higher functions that can be used as a stepping stone to access even higher frequencies,which is easier to do,as we ascend up the frequencies(12/2012). 

**What was the ascension process in 12/21/2012?** 

There was a lot of information broadcast by well recognized people about our ascension that would happen on December 21,2012.But a lot of us are still here wondering why?What happened?It's because the ascension information was not correct.They got a part of the ascension process right,because we are raising our frequency,but other parts of it were misunderstandings,such as the need to have a savior,a Messiah or a mass landing of our star brothers and sisters with a space ship that would take us away,etc.It's a good example of misinformation. 

If we fully understand the greater reality,we would know that the aliens are already here,but at higher frequencies,so we cannot perceive them.That means these people were not wrong about aliens per se.Everything out there has some truth attached to it,it's just how some people interpret the truth.The ascension process was misinterpreted to mean that we were going to suddenly ascend as a group to a higher level on this date.Clearly,that didn't happen. 

If a person is on a journey to get to the top of a mountain,they have to go up a hill,but maybe the road declines a bit or switches back and forth in places.The path towards the goal is a long path.It is about gradually getting there in both distance and height.The problem with ascension thinking is to assume that we're moving at the same level all the time and that we all jump up to the mountain top on a certain date. We're always slowly moving up this path individually,which is sometimes longer than if it was going straight up,like a knife edge. Now we know that's not how ascension works-it's individual and gradual (3/2013). 

**How can we discern the truth?** 

A simple rule is to stand back and take on board as many viewpoints as possible to gain a bigger picture rather than a singularized picture. There will always be individuals who got it right and other individuals who misunderstood some things.

If we can look at the bigger picture and look at all the information presented and interpreted in different ways by different people,then we see the truth and the commonality within it.We start to get intuition with help from our Higher Self and help from our Source on what the actual picture is.Then we'll know we're on the right track (3/2013). 

**What is meant by triangulation?** 

This is an extremely important concept,because it's the way in which those who are more aware and higher frequency can affect those around them by merely being there. 

For instance,a guru and their students are a localized version of it.The increased frequency transmitted from the guru to the students either in the same room or even at a distance can affect that level of transformation,if the student has a desire to learn from the teacher. That creates a triangulation effect irrespective of distance.In the case of groups of individuals who are highly aware,those inside the lines of triangulation will be affected by the energy as well. 

There are two types of triangulation.The first is directional triangulation where we have groups of people of a higher frequency affecting those in between them.They also start to rise,not at the same level,but they are affected by the higher frequency individuals. Actually,free energy is interested in being involved or around evolutionary content.It seeks out evolutionary content around groups of individuals who are increasing their evolutionary content,so it creates a link between the higher frequency individuals that are starting to rise up. 

The second type is inflational triangulation.If we have three or more groups that make a triangle,you get directional triangulation between them,so the area in between them is also affected.If have a right angled triangle and two sides point to groups of higher frequency individuals,then association through personal interaction or through friends of friends will increase their frequency from a topographical and energetic perspective as a result of being in that triangle area. 

For instance,in this meeting those who are evolved are also triangulating across the globe,because we're all in contact with each other in event space.This creates a significant effect with people caught in that triangulation area.The more people are involved in the group,the more amplified the condition is which affects more individuals between those groups.It's not just the power in numbers, but synergy as well. 

For instance,if we have three individuals working together,we get the exponential power of 3x3 or nine people,because of synergy.It's a "metaconcert"of people who are working energetically together,like musicians in a concert,who can create something bigger than themselves(3/2012). 

**Will ascension be a detectable event or is it just gradual growth?Will we see ascension in our lifetime?** 

It's just gradual growth and we're ascending right now.Because we're ascending slowly,we don't notice that we're ascending.This knife edge ascension that people want is never going to happen,because it relies on a critical mass to get there. 

But a critical mass can be created and it can be uncreated.If the critical mass relies on a certain number of individuals and those numbers drop by one,for instance,then there is a possibility that we could descend as well.That's not being allowed to happen apparently,so we've got a very gradual,slow ascension,which is happening all the time.Because we move up gradually,we get used to the frequencies. 

We're always experiencing ascension to a certain level within our lifetime.But the sort of ascension that we're talking about getting to we won't see it within our lifetime.It will certainly be beyond 50 years. Most of us won't be around in 50 years,so the level of connectivity and ability that was supposed to happen on December 21,2012 won't happen for at least 50-60 years. 

There's lots of evidence that we are ascending right now.There is technology coming through to various individuals who are getting access to higher levels of information.Clearly,the human being doesn't invent anything.It's the True Energetic Self that passes information down to those individuals who are in the sciences or medical fields.They think they are working on gut instincts or intuition,but they're actually tapping into their Higher Self and picking information that allows them to make groundbreaking changes in medical science and technology. 

From the spiritual perspective,people who are already aware or spiritual are getting more awareness and higher connectivity with their TES and multiverse.Those who weren't interested in spirituality are starting to become interested in spiritual subjects.This is proof of ascension(5/2014). 

**Before 2012 people saw ascension as a conscious transformation into the fourth or fifth density with removal of those who didn't qualify to play at this level?Is there a target?** 

The target is to eventually move up to 12th frequency level at the top of the physical universe.When we are working with the 12th frequencies, we'll have pretty much removed the need for incarnating at that level. Then we'll move into the 13th and 14th frequencies.They are still low enough to allow some form of physicality,which from our perspective is pretty much energetic,but are still low enough to allow some form of incarnate vehicle to exist (5/2014). 

**What happens to the lower energetic genre of True Energetic Selves, like those that incarnate as animals,plants when the physical universe ascends?Do they also ascend?** 

We don't project our souls into animals or plants or mineral entities. But they will also ascend,because it's not just a case of us ascending,it's everything that works with the physical universe will ascend as well. 

They will be of their own energetic genre,so they will still be like animal energy or plant energy or galaxy energy or planet energy.But they will be higher frequency,so they will still have their genre and they will ascend with us.They'll be part of the ascension process when we've gone past this Earth experiment on how individualized free will works. 

When we ascend out of the physical universe to enter the 13th frequency,then everything else that is still incarnate in the physical universe will gain individualized free will as well(5/2014). 

**If we're feeling dizzy,is it the intense energies or a symptom of ascension flu?** 

We are experiencing a slight evolutionary downturn right now,so people who are high frequency have been experiencing dizziness, bodily pain,joint pains,muscle aches,being out of breath,all of these different things.They're having to get used to the lower frequencies,so we're struggling a bit,because their bodies have been used to being lighter energy. 

Everybody is struggling a bit.We will be moving back up the frequencies again,because we are moving in a general direction up the frequencies.But we've got a little sawtooth effect where we go up and down in short,small movements where the average is generally up. Recently,we've experienced a bigger than normal movement downward,as seen by the things happening in the world with problems with Ukraine,Syria and other parts of the world.It's dragging us down (9/2015). 

**There has been talk of strong energies hitting the Earth at the end of September 2015?** 

We do get bombarded by certain energies in the way the planets are aligned,their gravitational and magnetic effects.We also get affected by some of the magnetic effects in the solar radiation from the sun, solar flares,equinox,etc.,so we are affected in that way.There's a little bit of that happening to people,but in my understanding that isn't the major thing happening around us.I don't see much credence in physical things affecting us spiritual individuals too deeply.It's mostly to do with the energetic side of things,as everything is energetic anyway. 

You could argue that the energies coming through from some of these planetary alignments are also affecting us,so they will have an effect, but not the same profound level of effect that we're experiencing as a result of having a downward shift in our ascension.We are more resilient physically and energetically than we give ourselves credit for, but when it comes to frequential stuff-our ascension or descension- we are much more sensitive (9/2015). 

**Ascension within event space seems to be changing.Is it our awareness or sensitivity to it that is changing?Or is it due the density of the Earth changing?Or due to more people becoming aware oftheir spiritual nature and connection to each other?** 

Effectively,we are moving up the frequencies,like an iterative loop that goes upwards.This loop is like a coil spring going upwards,but the pitch between the different coils or our frequential levels is either a big distance or a short distance depending upon how we are progressing collectively. 

If we are becoming more aware and awake,we start to trust our intuition and we expose ourselves to higher functionality.We gain more information and more experience.We start to trust that intuition,and as a result,we move up the frequencies.As we move up the frequencies again,we get exposed to other functions associated with higher frequencies and we start to work and trust those,so they become normal.When that happens,we start to move to another higher frequency. 

The more we work with ourselves,the more progress we get.The more positive results we get,the more we move upwards,the more we get exposed to higher functions,higher experiences,deeper levels of connectivity,more aware levels of connectivity,more understanding of who and what we are,and as a result,we move further upwards.This is the upward spiral or what you could call "positive karma,"if you used karma as a way of explaining our ascension or descension through the frequencies rather than the detail described in Avoiding Karma. 

We can progress upon that which we've progressed.It's a bit like when you've made the tools to make the tools,then you have the tools to make the tools to make further tools,so that you can make other tools to create the product which is detailed. 

For example,think of how we can now make a silicon chip compared to 1940s technology when we didn't have the tools to make the tools to make the tools.Once we start to have this movement upwards where we create these leaps forwards in technology or in metaphysical/spiritual advancement or spiritual physics,we continue to move upwards. 

It becomes a logarithmic curve-the movement upwards is slow at first,but eventually becomes totally vertical.When we are becoming more and more aware,our movement through event space is less,so we stay more aligned with our main line event space and main line series of events.We also start to experience more individuals on our level as well.We work with each other to help each other move onwards and upwards(6/2017). 

**The Pleiadians said it takes 144,000 people to create a grid of compassion.This happens after a natural disaster or a terrorist event, but then dissipates.You said the critical mass required for "group ascension"is 10%of the world population.In 2014,you estimated that 14 million people were becoming awake and aware,which is much less than 10%of the population of 7 billion on Earth.** 

I'm being told that we've actually lost a few people,because we've gone through a collective downward spiral lately.As we ascend the frequencies,we go through a saw tooth profile,which always goes up and down but is nominally upwards.The profile looks like a wood saw with a big tooth with little teeth on top of it.We've dropped down to a valley between one of these big teeth.This lower than expected drop down has caught everybody out.I didn't expect us to be coming down this far,but we have.(2/2017). 

**In 2017,are there more people awake and aware in the world now?** 

We've probably lost around two million people who were aware and awake.People who were becoming spiritual have sort of abandoned it, got disillusioned,fed up or bored,so we have lost people.But on the other side,we have other people who are starting to become aware and awake in this downward trend.They are actually more resilient than the people we've lost.Although we've lost about two million people bringing us down to 12 million,we've got the potential to go up to 26 million by the end of the decade.We're going to gain a load more individuals who are more resilient to the up/down trends,because they're becoming aware and awake on the way down(2/2017). 

**Are we still hovering between frequency bands 3.10-3.15 as a whole?** 

Basically,we exist in the first three frequencies(FB 1-3).Mankind calls them "dimensions,"but the first three frequencies are what create our gross physicality.Dimensions are a higher piece of structure within the multiverse created by our Source. 

As we are moving up the frequencies from FB 3.0 to FB 4.0,we go up incrementally through smaller "subfrequential levels."It looks like a saw tooth profile with big teeth and little teeth going up and down.At one point,we had gone up to 3.70,which is remarkable,but then we lost some people in terms of our critical mass and we dropped down to about 3.13.Now we're about to bottom out and then go back up.With all the new people who are becoming aware and awake on the downward trend,we'll start to move hopefully back up to 3.7 or higher (2/2017). 

**If some individuals are operating at higher levels,are they still at FB 3 or ascended into FB 4 or FB 5levels?** 

There are people who are "immune"to these downward trends, because they continue to hold their own frequencies.There are people who operate at levels higher than Frequency Band 3 and have moved into FB 4. 

Some of those in FB 4 have gone to FB 5 simply because they work on themselves in terms of how they think,behave and act.They stay directly on the spiritual path.They don't interact with the material world as much as everybody else does,so they move upwards.They keep themselves away from the general civilization,such as hermits or yogis in a reclusive state.They progress by limiting their contact with the outside world or by working in ashrams where everybody else is working on themselves. 

They're all helping each other move upwards.There's a few individuals who are able to work in the material world even with high levels of responsibility and materialistic wealth who still manage to ascend, because they know that the material world and their wealth doesn't mean anything (e.g.business owner).They're just using it for the purpose of helping others exist on the planet(2/2017). 

**Are the Pleiadians in 4D and Arcturians in 5D?Is Ascension just opening up to the higher dimensions and traversing them at will?** 

The Pleiadians and Arcturians are from the fourth frequency(FB 4)and fifth frequency (FB 5),not dimensions.They are an incarnate race- same as human beings-but they are higher frequency.If they're seen on the third level,they'll probably have a very visible aura of energy around them,because they have to use an energy field to stop them from being affected by the low frequencies associated with the third level.There would appear to be a shimmering light around them or they would be very bright as an entity.Some entities we experience are on the sixth level(FB 6)as well. 

From an Earth perspective,ascension is about moving up the frequencies.It's about working on ourselves and ascending the frequencies with our human body,then going into the fourth frequency Earth,the fifth frequency Earth,the sixth frequency Earth, etc. 

That's ascension,whereas projecting your consciousness into the different frequencies or higher dimensions is traversing the frequencies.That will also help you towards ascension.Sometimes going back to basics is the best way to move upwards.Although it appears to be a retrograde step,it isn't,because it reinforces the basics of what you've achieved and starts you to work on yourself again, building upon and reinforcing the foundations of what you've used previously (8/2018). 

**In The History ofGod the Byron entity said:"We are now at a point where we almost have the critical mass necessary to allow us to raise the frequency of the Earth back up to the levels that it should be." Does this mean a few years,decades or thousands of centuries?** 

When I wrote that book,it was looking like 50-60 years or even earlier. But with the way we've moved down the frequencies by becoming more materialistic and allowing some bizarre things to happen around us and then relinquishing our responsibility for them,such as our governmental and leadership decisions all around the world,my understanding is that the figure of 50-60 years has now gone further away.Things aren't static.We are able to control our ascension. 

Although we were getting a larger number of people who were alert, aware and awake for potentially massive inflational triangulation,they have started to drop down and are losing their connectivity with the spiritual and greater reality.My understanding now is that it could be over a hundred years away. 

We have to be very careful in how we think,behave and act and try to compensate for those who are dropping down the frequencies and becoming more materialistic in their thoughts,behaviors and actions, which create more karmic attachments (7/2019). 

**In The Carators Source said:"Your frequency level has been elevated as a result ofthese dialogues,but the speed has been rapid...even with ascension being as close as it is.”Does“close”mean hundreds of generations in the future or closer?** 

We went through the ascension before 2012,but the ascension wasn't a group ascension.We could have been very close to what we call"mass ascension"as a result of a critical mass being available.But my understanding is that this critical mass didn't happen,because we ascend individually.

When we start to ascend individually to the point that there's enough of us at a certain level,then we create a number of different triangulation functions-either directly or a volume/area-based triangulation-and we accelerate how others ascend the frequencies as well. 

As we ascend individually,we go into a different frequential environment.We may also choose to help those who are in a lower frequential environment.It's not like all of a sudden everybody else is enlightened or self-aware,because they've gone from the third to the fourth frequency. 

What happens is that people start to move up to that level in a faster and faster way,so it becomes a logarithmic curve rather than a knife edge upwards.Right now that potential has been pushed back. Previously,I was seeing it was fifty years away,but it's now over a hundred years away.That's if we stay where we are now and come out the other side.We need to do some drastic changes in our attitudes, thoughts,behaviors and actions to come back to where we could have been(3/2020). 

**The process of ascension draws parallels to "Rapture."Is Rapture a distorted foretelling of our ascension?If we need "backfill people"to balance out the people who have ascended,how come we haven't noticed a large number ofrighteous people vanishing from society?** 

Ascension is an individualized function,but it can happen collectively with those around us who are attracted to us and who we are attracted to.We all collectively move up together as a result. 

Ascension can be physical as well.It can be understanding how to think,behave and act in a proper way whilst incarnate.That level of realization is like a "minor rapture."It's recognizing what we're here for,how to navigate being here and how we can be of service to others. The number of people who we affect or who affect us can create a level of group ascension through group triangulation and direct line triangulation as well. 

The Rapture is a way of describing how we feel when we are in communion with our True Energetic Self (TES/Higher Self/Oversoul/Godhead).It's the difference between being human cut off with five senses vs.expanding into who we truly are with thousands of senses,total understanding,omnipresence and omniscience within the TES.That's the Rapture.It's like an understanding that we're all connected through everything.Everything is entangled.Rapture is part of that.It's like a vast understanding on a really deep level all at once. 

That's what's happening with individuals at times and they are disappearing out of view.Some people disappear and they're backfilled. I've noticed a lot more backfill people around the world than there was previously.Some of the backfill people are individuals whose human level soul has moved on and who had a walk-in by a backfill soul-not everybody's body is disappearing.It's the souls that are moving out,so you start to see people who "changed"for better or worse. 

For instance,Greta Thunberg's body was home to a different soul. When that soul had done its job and allowed the body to mature to a certain level,another highly evolved soul walked in to help humanity. I'm starting to feel that this new soul that came into Greta Thunberg is one of the White Children's souls.That's something else that I need to portray to you all(4/2020). 

**How does our ascension benefit Source when its expansion depends on our high entropy actions and behaviors?Doesn't its perpetual expansion depend on keeping us in the lower frequencies (e.g. unresolved traumas,backfill people that lower the overall frequency)?** 

Entropy means lossy,where we sort of lose the benefit of something.It does,but you have to realize that the human civilization is a very small one.There are billions of different incarnate civilizations throughout the physical universe and its frequencies. 

Think about the number of different galaxies in the physical universe in the third frequency that we can see and then multiply it by the number of galaxies that are in the fourth,fifth,sixth,seventh,etc.,up to the twelfth frequency.If you're being very,very conservative and assume that there's only one civilization per galaxy,then you've still got billions times the power of twelve. 

Human interaction is a very,very small thing within this universe.But it is quite special,because we've got this individualized free will.In terms of Source depending upon us,we're just one of very,very,very, very,very,very small components in the overall mechanism that's allowing the Source to expand and increase its own evolutionary content.The ascension from our perspective will happen,but we need to govern ourselves properly first individually and collectively. 

There are lots of other civilizations out there that lots of other souls are incarnating into to experience,learn and evolve.They've all got a part to play in the overall contributions as well.So if you think about our contribution being very,very small,like not even a drop in the ocean, and you divide the ocean,all the oceans in the world by a drop,you'll realize basically how many civilizations are out there helping the Source to evolve(7/2021).

### Astral Entities 

The astral entities are found at one of the astral levels (FB 4-7)in our physical universe.These astral entities represent low frequency thought- forms that have minor intelligence,but are not sentient and need a host to attach to in orderto survive. 

**I am concerned about my mother,because she is negative all the time. Could she be possessed or something?** 

I've just logged into her and picked up that she's attracted to low frequency aspects of the physical experience-call it karma.Karma can mean positive or negative,but it is attraction to a frequency whether it's higher frequency or lower frequency (karma).In her case,she has had a lot of suboptimal experiences and it's made her focus on the lower frequency aspects of incarnate existence.She's circled around it quite a lot-sometimes she goes down and sometimes she comes up again.In her case,it's to do with being associated or attracted to the lower frequencies. 

Sometimes people who are attracted to lower frequencies find that some of this is relieving for them.For instance,gossiping about certain individuals is a great stress reliever for people,so she's been attracted to that.Gossip is karmic,because it's focused on the negative aspect of something or somebody,the parts we don't like in others or in ourselves.To help her,just send her love,that's the biggest antidote.If you're sending love and you're always positive around her when you're with her and don't get drawn into her mindset,that will help a lot (11/2013). 

**You told us about healing a woman with an astral entity that had integrated down to the spirituo-molecular level.You removed it,but it came back?Why?** 

This was an astral entity that was looking to feed off the human being to perpetuate its own existence,because it doesn't have its own ability to metabolize energy,which is a physical function. 

In this case the entity had become very integrated with that person, because it had been there such a long time.It had gone into her energetic essence,so rather than looking for an astral entity that is usually outside of the person,I had to go right into the energies of what she was-inside her template levels.That was the only way I could remove that entity,because it was totally integrated. 

It's the first time I've seen this where an entity has been totally integrated within the energies right down to the energies between the atoms and between the electrons,neutrons and quarks and things.It was quite phenomenal(5/2015). 

**Was it integrated from the fourth level(FB 4)down to the first level (FB1)?** 

It had gone from FB 7 down to FB 1,not just FB 4,it was all the way through.It was right through the whole lot of that person.It was as if there wasn't any protection there at all.There was no auric layers at all, because the auric layers are a natural protection for us irrespective of whether we know how to use them in a psychic shield or not.But in this instance it had gone straight through those and it had stayed there.

It was part of her almost like a secondary soul within her,but clearly it was not a whole soul with all the frequency bands associated with it.I managed to remove it.It was like shifting microscopically small subatomic dust out of her.It was amazing to see,almost like this person had a double image for a moment,as the dust came out.This entity was almost identical to her energetically.When it was removed and recycled back to Source,the person was healed(5/2015). 

**How does a person get such deep attachments with parasites?Is it from drug or alcohol abuse or negative thought processes or what?** 

I would suggest that normal energetic parasites or astral entities can exist at four different levels:FB 4 (lower astral),FB 5 (upper lower astral),FB 6 (lower upper astral)or FB 7(upper astral).But the higher they get,the more benign they are. 

Generally,people get the bigger astral entities through drug or alcohol abuse or negative thought processes.It's when your guard is down.The ones that are just attached and taking energy from a chakra or somewhere else are smaller.But this particular parasite was almost like inside the quark level of the structure. 

Basically,it comes from a symbiotic relationship that's set up by the parasite and the incarnate soul.It becomes a codependence where the individual becomes so thoroughly adapted to that entity that they depend on it being there and vice versa.The entity desires to be there and wants to be dependent upon the host. 

That's the whole point of them attaching to us.But it's very much a case of there will be a thought process associated with it,which means that the individual is susceptible to that type of entity and level of integration(5/2015). 

**Is it correct that lower frequency entities can't attach to a person at high frequencies?** 

Yes,it is correct.However,we shouldn't be complacent.The moment we get complacent,we have an ego.The moment we have an ego,we have a dip in our frequencies.There are people who are naturally high frequency where an entity just can't attach to them and that's because they're naturally high and they work on themselves as well.In general, that means the person wouldn't be affected by entities that are low frequency (5/2015). 

**Does your Psychic Shield program protect us for life?** 

There's a Correspondence course,which is called a Psychic Shield.It uses similar techniques as in the Traversing The Frequencies workshop to activate the auric layers and add extra layers to create a robust, programmable psychic shield.It works well provided that you put the right kind of programming in there and don't miss anything. Generally,people can create this shield by themselves to cope with lots of stuff.You can program it to protect you for life(5/2015). 

**Can you tell us how to remove negative astral entities and eliminate psychic attacks?** 

When we have a desire to be spiritual,we are quite open energetically speaking.Most people are quite open without even realizing it.Unless we protect ourselves or we're naturally powerful,we will accrue or attract energy that has rudimentary intelligence.

It can't metabolize its own energy,so it has to find a host to feed off.In feeding off that host,it will give certain powers of coercion,strength, mental fortitude,feelings of power and confidence,so there is a symbiotic relationship between individual and the entities attached to them that exist in the astral levels(FB 4-7). 

In terms of psychic attacks or people being attacked by other people, most attacks result from sending aggressive energies to a person that isn't liked or has caused a problem or annoyed somebody.Alot of these psychic attacks are done subconsciously.When we think ill of somebody and we're really annoyed with them,we don't realize that we send them low frequency energy or aggressive energy and bombard their auric layers with this energy. 

We need to create a condition where we can protect ourselves from any energies that attack us or are coercive or controlling or are used to take energy from us,because some people like to get close to us to try to steal our energy,because their own chakras aren't in good condition. 

In terms of removing entities,you need somebody who is used to meditating using the third eye and is quite shielded themselves.A good healer who is shielded or protected can remove an astral entity of any sort.They're not really negative as such,they're just feeding off us. They will have all sorts of shapes and forms to try and scare us off, because they look inside our memories and try to find out what makes us scared.They will create a form that makes us scared,so we don't detect them or shy away from them even if we do detect them. 

When you see one of these things,make sure that you are protected.If you're doing this yourself,make sure you have the correct thought- form that says anything that's within your own auric field can come out,but it can't go back again and then you just take them off. 

Sometimes they don't like being taken off.They're a bit like a tick.They sort of bury their heads into you and you have to gently take them off or give them higher frequency energy,so that they come off naturally and then you send them back to the light.You create a recycling bin, which goes to Source that can take the energy and reuse it as normal energy to create anything it needs to.

After you take the entity off,you have to look at the area where they've latched onto the body and really cleanit.The best way is to visualize the area being infused in silver light.Silver is an antiseptic used in plasters and an energetic antiseptic as well.You have to infuse the area where you feel they've attached onto you with that silver light to clean the area up. 

Then you have to rebuild yourself on the seven templates going from the etheric body(FB 1)up to the top,which is the ketheric template (FB 7).I look at the area as being a matrix and rebuild the matrix on certain different levels.Or think of it as a three-dimensional fishing net with north-south,east-west,front-back axes.You reweave the net along the axes,so it can regenerate and heal the area. 

In terms of stopping coercion or energy,the only way to do it is to reinforce the aura and create additional layers outside of the aura using the Psychic Shield.Basically,we create a laminate by in/usine /ent in between the inside and the outside layers of the auric fields.

We infuse the light between the outer edge of level 1 and the inner edge of level 2,then repeat at level 2-3,then 3-4 and 4-5 and 5-6 to create this laminate.Once we get to level 7,we can create extra layers to go higher up.We infuse light between level 7-8 and repeat at levels 8-9 and9-10. 

Then we compact it all down,because these things can be quite large. They can start to interfere with other people's auric layers.We compact it down by visualizing it compacting.Then we create a vacuum to suck everything out of the area in between the inside edge of the first layer and the gross physical. 

Then we assign a command to that shield-saying that it's going to protect us from attacks or energies that are being used to hook energy from us or entities or people or coercion.We can assign any form of protection we can think of to the shield and it will shield us.It will be a general shield,but you can personalize it to shield you from a certain person or certain entities or whatever. 

You can also tell it to shield you from "Trojan Horses"in which an individual might use trusted people,friends,family or animals that we naturally let into our energy fields as a way to get into us.They hide within the energy fields of these trusted people,family or friends and animals and then come inside our energy field through them and start to attack us in that way. 

This is a very basic explanation.I would suggest that anybody who is feeling that they are being attacked would consider using the Psychic Shield,which was channeled to me a few years ago.It is found on my website.If you use it properly,it is very,very robust.It will last as long as you want it to last.You can assign it to last for the rest of your life (10/2016). 

**Is it correct that during Ayahuasca journeys,we open ourselves to lower astral entities?Could a shaman or medicine woman protect the individual during such ceremonies?** 

Any drug,that is used as a mechanica/way of experiencing some higher frequencies,works by creating such a low frequency vibration within the body that the soul has to get out of the body.Depending upon how low frequency the shock to the soul is determines how far out of the body it goes.We could go to the fourth (FB 4)or fifth level(FB 5)where low frequency astral entities exist or to the sixth (FB 6)or seventh levels (FB 7)where higher frequency astral entities are. 

The lower frequencies create the so-called "bad trip"and the higher frequencies create a "good trip."I don't condone the use of any chemicals whatsoever whether it's natural or manufactured to create the condition where we experience higher frequencies.Meditation is the only way forwards without a doubt and that's my understanding (8/2018). 

**Where does Ayahuasca come from?Why does it have such an effect on us when it is administered?How could we maintain that feeling ofoneness after a journey?** 

Basically,ayahuasca is a poison.All drugs are poisons,if they're used inappropriately in the wrong way.If you create a low frequency condition within the energies associated with the human form,the soul has to get out.The only feeling of oneness you've got is because you're experiencing a frequency above those of the normal gross physical frequencies when incarnate.

The only way to maintain the feeling of oneness afterwards is to meditate on being there.If you go to my website,you'll find documents that you can download,including the "Chakra Opening Exercises." Practicing these chakra opening exercises will help raise your frequencies.It will keep you there longer than ayahuasca and you get to do it every day and still maintain that feeling of oneness.It's perfectly safe and repeatable on a daily basis(8/2018). 

**In The Anne Dialogues you wrote:"From birth to one year:The chakras and auric field are not entirely developed at this point in the incarnation,which results in the Aspect having limited energetic functionality and personal protection from energetic attack of any kind."** 

Basically,when a child is born,they have underdeveloped chakras and energy fields.They don't have the natural protection that the auric field gives them.They want to be close to the mother whose energy system and auric layers are quite protective,a bit like the atmosphere on the Earth.That's why babies cry when they want to be with their mother.The baby feels protected within the mother's energies where other people's detrimental energies or astral entities can't attack them (3/2019). 

**When others ask about energetic attacks,you disregard it by saying that once we are ofa higher vibration,it shouldn't matter.But attacks still exist.Where do they come from?** 

Energetic attacks come from everywhere.Astral entities can be created by natural evolution and through us.They can be self-created through Darwinian evolution of energies where the same or similar energies group together in clumps or islands.They seek out other clumps of sympathetic energies and start to get limited intelligence.They gradually create a bigger entity with more intelligence. 

Up to a certain point they can achieve this.Then they get to a point where they can't maintain their energies,so the intelligence sort of dissipates.They need to find an energy source. 

We are a very good energy source,if we're open.The entities want to come into us as soon as they can.The younger we are,the less protected we are.They can get energy from us to perpetuate their own existence. Sometimes there is a symbiotic relationship where they give us feelings of power,ability to coerce people or to be successful in a way that justifies us giving them energy.We don't understand what we're doing from the human perspective,so it goes on in the background. 

We create astral entities in a subconscious way by an intention or a wish. We inadvertently create these things simply by our desire,intention or ill thoughts to harm somebody that wronged or annoyed us. The moment you think ill of somebody,you are projecting energy in some way,shape or form to that person.

The moment you gossip about somebody,you are projecting energy to them in a detrimental way. This is enough to create the opportunity for these energies to group together,so these entities can be created by natural evolution and through us. 

A lot of individuals throw energy at each other.They can send a strong projection of energy in a way to create some form of continuous attack on that individual.You know when somebody is attacking you,because you can feel their energy around them.If you go into an environment, where you feel the energy is not right and you walk out,that's because there's people who are throwing energy at each other. 

If you meet up an individual who you find adversarial,you'll find that they feel very nasty to you.Their energy feels sharp,because they're throwing energy at you.The energy can be coercive energy or direct attacks like bolt lightning,hooking energy or sucking energy from you as well(3/2019). 

**What can we do for protection when we're still susceptible?** 

Energetic attacks can come from human beings directly or indirectly through other individuals or it can come through the astral entities themselves.The Psychic Shield course is available on my website and as a workshop.It is designed to protect the unprotected. 

Some people are naturally protected,because of their energy, personality,sentience,evolution and their background lack of desire to connect with these things.Some people are naturally protected or naturally powerful,whereas others aren't.Personally,I disregard these entities,because I know they can't touch me,whereas others who are less forthright in their thought processes might have an issue (3/2019). 

**You said a child gets protection from energetic attacks by being close to the mother's energetic field.What about kids who end up with no parents shortly after birth?Or those who are sent to foster care or orphanages?Who protects them?** 

The child's energetic fields and chakras are still developing from around year zero to year seven,so they can get protection from other individuals who show them love in some way,shape or form by being within their energy fields.Children are very good at clinging onto the legs of their parents and other people who they feel can protect them. But these children do suffer a bit in terms of the lack of contact or the lack of protection from being in the energy field of a mother. 

The mother's love projects itself from the mother,so being in the house or close to the mother is always protective in some way,shape or form for a period of time.When the child is not within the immediate human aura,then that projected love is protective as well. 

By the way,this is the same thing for a guru.When a guru has a student,they invite that student to be close to them at the foot of their bed when they're sleeping to help elevate their frequency.They can start to experience what the guru tells them they can experience when higher frequency.Being elevated to a higher frequency by the guru is a bit of a springboard.This temporary experience gives them the incentive,encouragement and motivation to do the hard work to allow them to become higher frequency in their own right and to maintain their higher frequency. 

Basically,the people who care for the children help protect them.If the baby is adopted early,then the adoptive mother will protect that child with their love.If they're abandoned or orphaned or in a hospital,then the nurses or midwives who look after them will protect them.If they go to an orphanage,the people who love them,look after them,foster them or adopt them will also provide that energetic protection for them.

Irrespective of how it happens,they will get protection from that individual who is taking care of them.But there will still be a gap that will be filled in some way by the love generated by the caretakers,so there is transient protection there.Then depending upon how old they are,they can start to develop an energy system,which generates their own protection very quickly. 

If they don't,they may start to have psychological issues at times. Those children who are in and out of being protected will start to either generate their own protection naturally by using their aura subconsciously or they will generate some psychological issues associated with being bombarded by all the random thoughts and energies that people project at random times or in aggression.They may have a difficult time depending on how much protection they get on a transient basis through being nursed,adopted or fostered(4/2019 &5/2019). 

**Is it possible for an aspect to draw out negative entities from another aspect and then send them into the light?What is this called?Does it harm the aspect who takes the entity out?** 

That's called entity removal.Healers can do it.They're removing lower frequency astral entities.I wouldn't call them "negative"entities. Sometimes there's other entities who have walked-in to the body,but they can be removed and sent back to their True Energetic Self,if it's a soul or sent to Source to be recycled,if it's an astral entity. 

Entity removal is a common thing for healers to do.It just takes skill and training.By the way,you can't just do it unless you've had the instruction from a competent healer,because they can jump from the patient to the healer,if the healer isn't competent and can't move it on to Source (11/2019). 

**Why do lower astral entities fear that they are going to go extinct as a result of the Earth moving up through the frequencies?They are not created by Source.Don't they evolve?** 

No,lower astral entities are created by either stray thought processes of anger by us or by Darwinian evolution of energy.If they're created through stray thought processes by humans or other incarnate entities,they don't have any reason to be here.They're just there, they're sort of Flotsam and Jetsam. 

When we move up the frequencies,they may attach themselves to us, but they can't keep up with us.They can no longer steal our energy and maintain their existence,because they can't metabolize their own energy.They fear that,so they create fear in us to maintain their existence.In doing that,we keep ourselves low frequency,and therefore,we don't move up the frequencies,so they can stay where they are.It's of benefit to them,not us (1/2021). 

**What is the difference between a ghost and astral entities?** 

An astra/entity is an entity that's created through stray thoughts by ourselves or uncontrolled thoughts by ourselves or other incarnate individuals or through the natural Darwinian evolution of energy that's gradually gained its own intelligence through the attractivity of similar energies or frequencies. 

Somebody might look at an astral entity and think it's a ghost and vice versa.But my understanding is that ghosts are those aspects or souls that have not recognized that their physical form is demised.They are still attached to being on the Earth as a result of that.Or they're addicted to being on the Earth and they don't want to go back into the energetic fully,the higher frequencies of their True Energetic Self (TES/Higher Self/Oversoul)and enter into one of the many versions of communion with their TES(2/2021). 

**Do ghosts stay attached to gross physicallevels(FB 1-3)or go higher?** 

They're not in FB 1-3 or gross physical levels,because if they were, they'd be incarnate.They would be fully visible,fully solid.So the lowest they can really go is the fourth level (FB 4).Some of them-what we classify as poltergeist-develop the ability to use energy to move things.But that's very energetically expensive.It's something to bear in mind that when you see objects moving around the room,the soul that's doing that is expending a lot of energy(2/2021). 

**Does a ghost have access to its chakras or energy through an astral body that they retain?** 

They don't retain any astral body and they don't have any chakras, because chakras are associated with the energy templates that create the incarnate vehicle of different types (human or alien). 

Ghosts don't have any energy templates.Although some people classify it as an "astral body,"it's not an astral body,because it's the sentience and energy that is the essence of the soul that is deciding to stay close to the Earth frequencies.It's not an astral body as such.They don't retain anything associated with their incarnate vehicle(2/2021). 

**If not,how do they exist with or without an energy source?** 

It's sentience.Don't forget that everything we are is sentience.But we have a body of energy to allow us to experience the environment that we're within to experience,learn and evolve.So the body of energies are either given to us by our True Energetic Self or if we are a True Energetic Self,we accept that energy from Source. 

We can detach the sentience from the energy and use another energy to experience something else,if we wanted to.Sentience doesn't need energy to exist-it just is.It uses energy to experience,learn and evolve by being part of an energetic environment that allows the soul to experience it by using and experiencing the energy in the way it's supposed to be experienced(2/2021). 

**Would you describe the functions of the "slug-like entities"and other lower astral entities you mentioned in your book,Psycho-Syiritual Healing?How do they choose their targets?** 

The slug like entities are a bit like astral entities.They are created through their own Darwinian evolution.They are low intelligence entities-like a slug,an amoeba,a sea cucumber.They look for fast and easy food and we're fast food.We waste a lot of energy.We broadcast energy. 

When our chakras pull in energy and it's used to animate and energize the gross physical and the spirituo-physical aspect of human vehicle. But we also create a waste product,which is the aura.It's just like when we turn on a light,heat is created as a byproduct,so the lamp gets hot. Their targets are those that are not so protected or are naturally unprotected.They can easily move into the energies,move past the series of auric layers,which are a bit like magnetic fields around a magnet,which are a bit like the changes in temperature surrounding a light bulb.If there is no resistance,they move in as close as they can do and take energy and they take it for free.That perpetuates them and actually helps them grow.That's how it works(7/2021). 

**Would you explain the functions of energetic hooks?Why are they created and what are they for?How come some are more complicated and detrimental than the others?** 

Energy hooks are created by us to attract the attention of others and control them.Depending upon our desire to attract the attention, coerce or control somebody determines how complicated the energy hook is and how difficult it is to remove.They're a function of us trying to attack or control somebody for our own ends,needs or benefits. 

You see this quite often with partnerships where one person is stronger than the other or a manager of somebody else who is trying to get things done by using somebody else rather than doing things themselves.It's a way of activating control of the individual through the energies,so you link to them and they can't get away from you.It's like a fish on a hook.The person who is controlling you is playing you like a fisherman. 

It's difficult to get those hooks out-very difficult depending upon how much desire that person has.It could be created for charismatic desire, charismatic power,coercive power or for negotiating power.The ease of removal depends upon how deeply these hooks go into us,how embedded they are and how many barbs they have(7/2021).

### Autism Spectrum 

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)is a function of a higher frequency incaration.They are here to help raise the overall frequency ofthe human population and the planet itself. 

**Could you tell us about Autism Spectrum Disorder (e.g.Autism, Aspergers,etc.).Why do souls choose that path?Is it spiritually based or related to certain vaccines or toxins or other external factors?Are these people hybrids of galactic races or something?** 

It's basically a function of how we've chosen to incarnate.There are newer generations of children that have higher freguency energy sets built into them to give them higher communicative ability and other spiritual abilities that standard humans don't have. 

Initially,the children were born as yure indigo or pure crystal or pure rainbow types,which are the "three waves of volunteers."The newer children ("fourth wave")are hybrids of either two types (rainbow- indigo,rainbow-crystal,indigo-crystal)or all three types (rainbow- indigo-crystal).These hybrids are more resilient and robust in coping with the low frequencies in many places on the planet whilst helping to lift humanity's frequencies upward. 

Autism (ASD)is a bit of a halfway house hybrid.It's to do with how they're incarnated and the energy set they've decided to use.They have either halfof a rainbow energy set or halfof the crystal energy set or half of the indigo energy set.They come here with a completely different level of understanding of how to be here.Most of them are totally trusting and innocent.They cannot lie,because they don't know how to lie,connive,contrive,coerce,because they are totally and utterly above all that stuff. 

That's why they have difficulty in working in this particular environment where everybody has their own agenda,where they're all trying to compete or do better than somebody else.Arguably,autistic individuals are ahead of their time,because my understanding is that at some point all incarnate human beings will have the same sort of behavior profile as autistic people or Aspergers people. They are not hybrids of different galactic races,they're just hybrid energy sets in a human vehicle.

They are better suited for communal connectivity with others like them-not like a hive mind,but they prefer to be around people of their own type.They can communicate with each other both telepathically and empathically. 

Because most people aren't able to do that,they struggle to work here. When we become more connected,we will operate in a more communal sense as well,like we do when we're meditating together. That will be our natural condition rather than having to dip into it only when we're doing a group meditation(7/2015). 

**Do they lack emotions or a lower emotional center?** 

No,they definitely have emotions.Most of their problems are because of the emotions they would normally use.They are very trusting personalities,simple in their outlook,very reliant on others sometimes to do or help them with the normal day to day work.As a result,a lot of them struggle with being here.It's very hard work for them(7/2015).

**Are their chakras the same as ours?What is a composite chakra?** 

It's quite possible that they have a so-called "composite chakra,"which is one larger chakra that copes with all the frequency ranges of the first three chakras.That means all of the frequencies associated with the first/base chakra,second/sacral chakra and third/solar chakra would be handled by one composite chakra.The same chakra deals with the very lowest frequency that the base chakra deals with and the very highest frequency that the solar chakra deals with as well. 

Depending upon their level of autism and their level of connectivity with the higher frequencies,they may not need to have a base chakra,a sacral chakra and a solar chakra as separate chakras per se.The composite chakra is designed to work with all three energies at once because the individual is not functioning on those levels.They are functioning on higher levels associated with the fourth/heart chakra, fifth/throat chakra,sixth/spiritual/third eye chakra and the seventh/crown chakra(7/2015) 

**Do some ofthem have more than one soul in their body?** 

I'm being told,yes,they can do.They can definitely have more than one soul in their body.But generally they would have one main soul-one primary soul and the other souls would be passive,so they're there just to observe and experience what the primary soul is experiencing,but in a passive sense(7/2015) 

**They don't have filters,so they have sensory overload?** 

They have sensory overload.They experience everything in one go, because they don't have the same barriers or filters that the rest of us have throughout our life from the point of conception right up to the demise of the human form.We are constantly throwing barriers around each other and ourselves,so we start to miss out on the normal communication between us.We're missing out on the empathic and telepathic communication and various other types of higher functions that we normally have as a higher frequency entity (7/2015). 

**Do they exist in the fourth frequency band or higher?** 

No,if they're in FB 4 and we were in FB 3,we wouldn't see them.Their level of connectivity is probably consistent with something higher,so they would probably have the ability or thought processes and functions associated with being probably in FB 5.But that level of ability is closed down,because their physical aspect is in FB 3.As a result,they struggle being here (7/2015). 

**So it's not vaccine induced?It's chosen at the soul level before incarnation?** 

That's right,it's not vaccine induced.It's chosen at the soul level definitely.Sometimes the soul chooses a body,which is supposed to have been in a certain event space or "timeline"where these types of individuals would be more prevalent.They would be more able to communicate with each other,share things and work together and they miss it.It's a bit like they get the wrong event space and why they have trouble,because they expected to be in a certain environment and they aren't there.They're here with standard humans instead(7/2015). 

**If 1 in 96 male children being vaccinated develop autism,how does that work?** 

There's going to be some in the group of 96 children who are meant to be autistic,because it's part of their life plan.They have come in and selected those different energy sets,and therefore,they're autistic.It's what their soul wanted to experience in this lifetime. 

Occasionally,there are versions of autism that develop as a result of a chemical interaction.The chemicals kick off a change in the way the DNA and RNA work with the etheric and other templates that create the human form.The child can be lifted in frequency as a result of this chemical interaction,which may be seen favorably by the child's soul, but unfavorably by their parents. 

I would say that 1/96 wouldn't be a function of the chemical side of it, because it's already there and it can manifest later.I'm told that autism can manifest after birth.You might have a perfectly functioning baby from the human perspective with no apparent disease.It can develop autism later either as a result of what their life plan is or as a result of these chemical cocktails that are used to inoculate them (e.g.vaccines taken together or in a short time span). 

I'm being told that having these vaccinations is not a particularly good idea before the age of 7 years,because they don't have a fully developed energy system yet whereas an adult is capable to taking on-board vaccinations (7/2015). 

One thing is clear,we're lower frequency,so the physical body needs help at times.There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines.Some of the vaccines are necessary with certain individuals.Vaccines are useful when we're incapable of healing ourselves or protecting ourselves energetically. 

If we don't have the right level of sentience to be able to work in higher frequency ways,for instance,and use our energies to be able to protect ourselves from a disease or a virus,then we are in the need for certain vaccines(6/2019). 

**Would you recommend not vaccinating all babies?Infectious diseases can kill the child(e.g.scarlet fever,mumps,etc.)?** 

Vaccination of babies is a bit of a difficult subject,because from the human perspective,it seems good to have protective immunity.But from the energetic perspective,the human form is still developing right up until its 7th year.Any chemicals that are introduced into it whether they're vaccinations or other stuff will affect the way the baby's energy system works and the way the gross physical form interacts with it.My feeling is that we shouldn't vaccinate babies at the start. 

It's true that infectious diseases,such as scarlet fever,mumps,chicken pox,smallpox,all this sort of stuff can kill the child.But we have to understand that certain souls might only want to experience incarnation for a certain period of time.We have to ask ourselves:Are forcing the soul to continue its incarnation by inoculating this body? Or are we helping that body become available for another soul who wants to "walk-in"to it?It's difficult to answer that(7/2015). 

**Indigo,crystal and rainbow children and their hybrid combinations have different energy sets.How do they differ energetically?**

Each of those different names-indigo,rainbow and crystal-are Earth based spiritual terms for individuals who display different capabilities in terms of their ability to work with others,their communicative ability,their link with their guides and helpers,their Higher Self,their ability to recognize or remember their life plan and their ability to work with higher and lower frequencies.They are more tolerant of the frequencies. 

When we started to see these new children coming to Earth,they came in different waves.Dolores Cannon called them the "three waves of volunteers."Each wave came in at a different point in Earth's evolutionary progression.Each of the pure types(e.g.pure indigo,pure crystal and pure rainbow)was capable of working with a slightly higher base resonant frequency of the Earth. 

Because Earth has locally high and locally low frequency areas that may change over a lifetime,the pure types couldn't cope with the changes in some areas.We needed to have /ybridsof these children (e.g. crystal-indigo,crystal-rainbow,etc.)that were better able to cope depending on whether they were static in location or moving around the planet. 

The most recent hybrids have all three energy sets (e.g.indigo-crystal- rainbow),which makes them multifaceted and better able to cope with the changes.The labels refer to the frequential level of the soul in the body and the human form's ability to cope with higher frequency whilst incarnate on the Earth(2/2016). 

**Does the energy set depend on the mother's or parents'energy sets? Or the frequential version of Earth they are born into?** 

Basically,the mother or the parents have no part,no influence whatsoever energetically on the energetic state of the offspring.It's all to do with what's been organized prior to the incarnation,prior to insertion of the soul into that particular human body.You will very likely see very,very advanced spiritual individuals being born into families where the mother and father and their siblings are totally against spiritual behaviors. 

That's quite common.You start seeing people coming across as spiritual leaders and their own families are not even religious.So it's nothing to do with the parents themselves,it's to do with the life plan of the soul that was agreed to prior to incarnation.Therefore,the human form that it incarnates into is 'manufactured'or manifested to a frequential level that's consistent with that soul,its ability and necessary functionality (2/2016). 

**You said autistic children have a half-energy set of indigo,crystal or rainbow children.What does that mean?How does it work in the human form-composite chakra?** 

We are starting to see composite chakras in certain individuals.By composite chakras,I mean the chakras that we normally have are the first/root chakra,the second/sacral chakra and the third/solar chakra, which are all associated with the gross physical.There are some individuals whose frequential state has progressed to the point where those three chakras aren't necessary,because they're working at a higher frequency. 

They have a single chakra that copes with all three frequencies, because their body is dealing with the higher frequencies associated with the fourth/heart chakra,the fifth/throat chakra,the sixth/spiritual/third eye chakra and the 7th/crown chakra.At the moment,the composite chakra tends to be in the lower frequencies(FB 1-3). 

But the autistic children have a half hybrid energy set where it's half crystal,half indigo or half rainbow.They are of a frequency associated with one of those types of indigo,crystal or rainbow,but not all of them.But they are semi-connected to higher frequencies all the time. They tend to be all there or halfway there,as the case may be. 

I think of the autistic children as potentially the new level of Homo sapiens,as to where we're going to be.They're a more trusting mindset. 

They're loving.They haven't got an aggressive thought in their minds, so from my personal experience,they're wonderful individuals,as are people with Aspergers,very trusting,very shy individuals,so they don't particularly mix well with "normal"human beings.I think they're wonderful people.We just categorize them totally incorrectly (2/2016) 

**Are these energy sets related to our DNA strands?Do we have 12 DNA strands or not?** 

There is a lot of misinformation about DNA.DNA is simply a communication medium that is both physically and energetically represented.It works with the RNA,which communicates with the DNA and programs the DNA,which communicates back to the RNA, which feeds back into the energetic templates to say that the gross physical aspect of the human form is responding correctly to the templates.

The number of DNA strands is not an indication of a higher frequency. In fact,it means nothing in my understanding.It is simply the potential to have a greater level of detail or in some respects a greater level of dysfunction depending upon where we are. 

We have seven levels of DNA strands right now.The interesting thing is that the mouse genome is very close to the human genome.That's why there is lots of work in vivisection using the mouse genome.But if we have 12 strands,all it would mean is that there is much more capability for mutation,much more capability for potential regeneration of limbs,for instance,much more potential for physical multifunctionality,but nothing that is related to the energetic. 

From a physical perspective,if there is an energetic function associated with DNA,which there is,then there will be more communication between the templates associated with the gross physical and spirituo- physical aspect of what we are and the gross physical as it is right now. In terms of 12 DNA strands,physically it means nothing,but energetically it would mean there's a greater level of connectivity between the incarnate soul and its physical vehicle.It would be easier to control it,manipulate it and manifest healing,for instance(2/2016). 

**Are these energy sets related in any way to our % masculine/yang or feminine/yin energy composition?** 

No,it's simply a functionality.The yin and yang,the feminine and masculine,the black and the white,up/down,left/right, forwards/backwards is simply a dualistic function associated with the physical universe and how the human body has been designed to reproduce. 

Clearly,there are energy sets associated with the chromosomes,etc., and the DNA associated with whether the human form is male or female.But the energy sets themselves don't specifically mean anything from that perspective,because when we're talking about higher frequential functionality,there's no difference between masculine and feminine-it's just energy (2/2016). 

**What are the mechanics of incarnation of the newer children and autistic children?** 

The mechanics are the same as a standard human vehicle.But the energies associated with the energy system-the chakras and energetic templates-are constructed from different energies,not just the basic energy that's used to allow the interface between the gross physical and the soul,i.e.the energy system,the chakras and the different energy templates. 

What we have here is just a different set of energies,so we get the indigo,the crystal and the rainbow children.The different frequencies allow different types of functionality,different abilities to remain higher frequency whilst being involved in lower frequency environments and around lower frequency individuals. 

There's various different hybrid versions of this as well,so we don't just get indigo children or rainbow children or crystal children,we get hybrids of crystal and rainbow,crystal and indigo,indigo and rainbow or all three together.This gives them a better integrated vehicle to work with energetically and gross physically to allow the soul to be able to work with higher frequencies whilst in lower frequencies. 

Autistic children are arguably of a similar type,except that they have got a better level of functionality.They don't need to be a hybrid of the crystal-indigo-rainbow energies.They can simply be entities who are incarnate who have a higher level of connectivity with their True Energetic Self,and therefore,the rest of Source.They're able to operate in a way,which is consistent with them being inner energetic and not specifically gross physically,as we do with our normal incarnation (6/2017). 

**How are the incarnate vehicles of indigo,crystal and rainbow children created?You said autistic kids have a "half hybrid energy set"(meaning either half of a rainbow energy set,or half of the crystal energy set,or half of the indigo energy set).What does that mean?** 

Their vehicles are created exactly the same way.The energy is chosen, used and inserted into the gross physical vehicle at conception.What that means is that it's a different level of function.Another way of looking at it is that they only need to have a five chakra set,because they don't operate on the first three levels separately.They would have one "composite chakra"that deals with the first three frequencies and then they'd have the 4th,5th,6th and 7th chakras(6/2017). 

**What do you mean by an "energy set"?How does an indigo energy set differ from a rainbow or a crystal energy set?Is one set higher frequency than another energy set?**

What I mean by the energy set is that it's the energies associated with how the chakras respond.Think of it in terms of a radio.You can buy one radio that works with a certain number of frequencies,but above those frequencies,they don't work. 

Think of these children,the indigos,the crystals,the rainbows and the autistics,as having radios that work on frequencies above the standard radio we can get.They would be working on ultra-high frequencies or mega-high frequencies-well above the standard radio system,which means they've got more connectivity. 

Because they're hybrids,they are able to operate in various different functions correctly.So if a hybrid has a mixture of the indigo,rainbow and crystal energies,then they would be able to operate correctly on all those three levels.If they've only got rainbow,they could only work correctly on the rainbow levels of energies,not crystal or indigo levels. 

If you've got an entity that's got crystal and indigo,they'll be able to work properly on those levels,but not on the rainbow level.It's all about what you're able to tune into basically. If you've got a radio that can tune into two different channels at the same time and listen to those channels,then that's what a rainbow and a crystal child would get-a mixture of rainbow and crystal energies. One that's just got crystal energies without the other two would be able to tune into one channel,whereas one that's got crystal,rainbow and indigo would tune into three channels.It allows them to change the different levels of frequency and access the functions and abilities associated with them.Basically,the energy sets are different levels of frequency.They give us access via higher levels of communicative ability with our True Energetic Self(6/2017). 

**What does a halfhybrid energy set mean in an autistic child?** 

The difference between these children-the indigo,rainbow and crystal children,whether they're the singular energy set or a hybrid energy set-and the autistics is that the autistics have a better way of unlocking it. 

Most of the other children are clever or more spiritual or more connected,but the autistics have a way of unlocking it in one particular way.They don't understand how they do it,so they get pulled into that particular method of communication.They get locked into it,which makes them "specialized,"whereas the rainbow,crystal and indigo children,although they're specialized in their frequency set,are more“generalized." 

The autistics have-even if they're an autistic and a version of the hybrid of indigo,crystal or rainbow child-an unlocked or unadjustable method of gaining higher communicative functions,whereas the indigos,crystals and rainbows that aren't autistic aren't specifically unlocked like the autistics.Therefore,they can't get locked into what they are,but they're more generalized as a result of it,so they get little bits of functionality from those different levels.Moreover,they're able to cope with the various frequential shifts that occur as they move around the planet (6/2017). 

**Are these energy sets chakra based or frequency based?How do they work in terms of the soul vs.the vehicle?** 

The soul is well above any frequencies associated with the physical universe.In terms of the chakras,the energy sets are within the chakra range and above the chakra range. 

For example,a child would have a single composite chakra to allow them to work on the three gross physical levels (FB 1-3),and then an individualized chakra for the frequencies associated with the heart(FB 4),throat (FB 5),spiritual or third eye (FB 6)and the crown (FB 7) chakras. 

But some of these children are able to access the 8th,9th and 10th levels(FB 8-10)as well.So you've got a single chakra that works with all the gross physical energy and then the other chakras that work with the spirituo-physical energies and then you've got the ability to access functionality on the 8th,9th and 10th frequencies.There are no chakras on these levels,so it's pure connectivity and pure accessibility rather than connectivity through pulling energy in(6/2017). 

**What do people with Autism have to do when it comes to visualization?They report images being blurry or being unable to hold them for more than a few seconds or being too in their head and difficulty in seeing with the mind's eye.What are the reasons for these?** 

My feeling is that they are being confused by what they're experiencing and by what the rest of the population around them are telling them they should be experiencing,so that creates a block.If somebody with autism is told to meditate and visualize something,for instance,they would work in a way,which is going against their natural connectivity. So you start to get this struggle between the way they normally work without any effort at all vs.how they're being told to work,which requires effort,because they're going against the flow basically. 

They're struggling to work with the way that the rest of incarnate mankind wants them to work when in reality autistics are ultimately connected all the time.It's all to do with trying to conform with what they're being told everybody else does when they've got instantaneous understanding of what the greater reality is. 

People with Asperger's syndrome are the same way.They have total connectivity.They don't need to work things out.They don't need to show how a mathematical equation goes from the start to the finish. They only need to show the piece in the middle and they just know that's the answer,if you give them the question. 

They don't go down the road of justifying it or quantifying it.They know the answer,because they're connected and they trust the connection.It's only when they happen to be put in this position that they must work in this way,that it removes the trust in that connection and things get blurry or difficult for them to work with (12/2017). 

**It would be helpful also if you could write a guide designed for people who are not 'neurotypical'in mind to offer instructions on how best to approach endeavors like astral projection,activating the third eye and do magick work/visualization?** 

There's a book called Psycho-Spiritual Healing.This book may have an Appendix at the back that is designed to help people work with what they are rather than what they're told they should be.That would help people heal,specifically people with autism or Aspergers,because they will recognize that the way they work is right and the way that they've been told to work isn't right for them.My Traversing The Frequencies workshop methodology also moves you beyond astral projection and activating the third eye can be done there as well(12/2017). 

**I've known people who are very upset that they can't visualize and communicate with spirits or entities properly because of Asperger/Autism Spectrum?** 

What I'm feeling here is that along with the standard human being, this is quite common and natural for everybody.It's not specific to people with Aspergers or autism spectrum that blur the lines between those two functions.It's a common thing. 

What we need to understand is that we have a main function that we work with.It can be a tactile response to various different questions that we ask of spirit.It can be hearing tinnitus,for instance,that could be a way of recognizing that we've got an answer.Or we could hear with our mind's ear spoken words,usually in the language of our current incarnation.We can see visualizations or we can have just knowingness. 

So you've got clairaudience,clairvoyance and clairsentience along with clairtactivity,which is all the physical responses associated with it, such as tingling in the body or around the area of the third eye and around the periphery of the skull.What we normally have is our dominant response. 

It might be visualization but not audio and not knowingness.It might be knowingness but not audio or visualization.It might be tingling in the hands but not audio,visual or knowingness.It's a case of which response we get,but we ignore,because we want to have visualization or communicate with entities.We need to work on that first. 

When I do the Traversing The Frequencies work,some people get frustrated,because they're not seeing something,but they're hearing an awful lot and they ignore what they're hearing.Other people hear an awful lot,but they want to see.These people want to experience something associated with a different function that they've got. 

We might have a dominant function of clairaudience,clairsentience, clairvoyance or clairtactivity and we might desire another function rather than the one we've got.What we have to do is work with the one we're good at.Work with it,use it,trust it and progress with it and perfect that. 

That raises us through the frequencies and then we get to a stage where our functionality changes,because we're higher frequency.Then those other functions start to come into it.Then we might have clairsentience as well as clairvoyance.Then we work on clairsentience and clairvoyance and start to get clairaudience or another combination. 

It's really about working with what we've got-not worrying about what we would like to have,but knowing that provided we work with enough diligence and dedication that we will eventually get those other functions as a natural condition associated with being higher frequency.So really it's about calming down,just going with the flow and working with the function that is working for you(12/2017). 

**Something people with Autism ask often is how do they participate in endeavors that involve communicating with beings or work that involves relating to beings?** 

When we work with other beings,whether they're incarnate or disincarnate (incarnate at a higher frequency or not incarnate at all), we have to be very careful,because there are astral entities,who are lower frequency astral entities (around the 4th and 5th levels or even the 6th),who take advantage of us by using our desire or our desperation to communicate with something and slot into our energies as a result of that. 

Basically,they look at our desperation and then fulfill our desires by talking to something.We're talking to an astral entity,but sometimes they try and coerce us and take energy from us as well.We have to be very,very careful of what we do with it.We have to be discerning about who and what we communicate with.You can broadcast your desire to enter into communication with any entities of high frequency. 

This is one thing we do with the Traversing The Frequencies workshops.I would suggest that you do it in a meditation and that you broadcast that you only wish to communicate with entities of high frequency,for instance,over the 13th frequency level.Then you'll get a more benign and benevolent function rather than an adversarial function in terms of what you're communicating with and the information you're getting. 

It's about sitting down,meditating,clearing the mind,focusing the eyes upon the location of the third eye and mentally stating that you wish to communicate with an entity that should be pure,high in frequency and at least above the 13th frequency level(preferably the 14th and above)and just see what happens.The communication will come in several different ways.It will either be visualization (clairvoyance),hearing things (clairaudience)or knowing things (clairsentience),for instance. 

It might not be communication in terms of a chat or a dialogue with them.It may be that you feel a presence and something will come- some level of understanding.You can ask them questions about certain things:Can you describe something for me?Can you explain this or that?They will do so.But you might find it won't be how you expected. It might not be like having a conversation in the way you think it. 

With my work it can vary.It normally comes through in a variety of different ways depending upon the information coming through. Quite a lot of it is clairaudience.I get a lot of clairvoyance as well when it's required,because explaining concepts should be explained in a number of different ways.I get lots of stuff just through knowingness. Then I have to sit there for a long time working out how I'm going to put this into words,because knowing is one thing,but writing it down in human terms is something else. 

With all of this stuff,don't try to logic it out.When we receive something,write it down.Don't judge it,don't question it.Don't try to work it out,just write it down.When you start to judge it,work it out or question it,then you lose the connectivity,because you're starting to doubt what's there.A level of doubt is a big issue in terms of not being able to work with other entities or beings who are disincarnate or incarnate or just clairsentience about understanding things. 

It's about understanding and working with knowing that what you're getting is right and accepting it,being in full acceptance.Then write it down or if you've got a voice recorder,verbalize what you've experienced.Then just get the feeling of it as well,because in general we don't just get audio,visualizations or spoken word in our spiritual ear or knowingness,we also get feelings associated with them as well. These are emotions and it's another means of communication as well. 

An emotional response might be a person's major functionality,so that should be used as well and worked with and perfected to allow it to move up the frequencies,to allow it to get access to the other functions that come naturally.Just be in a state of beingness.Accept the fact that there's going to be times when you sit and meditate and nothing happens. 

Just enjoy the bliss of nothing happening around you and that's the most important thing.Accepting the bliss and nothingness is one of the little tests that Source gives us to see if we're dedicated enough.We're always tested in various different ways to check out and make sure that we are dedicated and clean and pure.This is one of those ways (12/2017). 

**My friend said autistics are "children of the sun,"but spiritual intelligence and connectivity have nothing to do with autism.To me autism is going lower,not higher.Autistics are not the children ofthe sun,we all are or nobody is?** 

I'm just logging into this saying "children of the sun."It's one way of saying that they are pure.They are sort of stuck in a level of connectivity that they can't use properly,because everybody around them is deaf,dumb and blind basically.Those other individuals who are more awake and aware will naturally communicate on other channels, so autistic individuals will pick up on this and grow towards them. 

But in real terms,they are almost limited by their abilities.Their abilities are special abilities and they are certainly more connected and more clairsentient than the average incarnate individual who is immersed in their incarnation.But they are limited by this lack of communicative ability with others. 

They can communicate with other autistic individuals in a fairly high way and a very intuitive way.But when it comes to being associated with the rest of incarnate society,they have difficulty communicating, so they appear to be of a lower frequency.They're not at a lower frequency. 

It's just that they've got this communicative ability that relies more on clairsentience or cosmic knowingness or spiritual knowingness more than logic or education.They can log into it and they can do it instantaneously.They have no capacity for the way we use to understand things.Although they categorize things and like to sort things out in a structured way,that's the only way they can interface with us. 

I'm being told it is to try to categorize things,because they experience things in a more holistic way.The only way they can understand what we're doing is to categorize things,pigeon hole things,log them down and put them in a matrix.It's all to do with the ability to communicate and our inability to communicate with them on the sort of levels and the frequencies that they do (5/2018).

**Children with autism are 67%more likely have inflammatory bowel disease affecting the large or small intestines.Does this have something to do with their composite chakra that replaces the functions ofthe lower three chakras in their body?** 

It's not anything to do with the chakras,it's to do with stress.Autistic children or autistic humans in general are very greatly misunderstood and are subject to a severe amount of stress as a result of being badly or poorly understood.That stress manifests itself usually within the stomach area to the bowel,because the whole thing is joined together from the throat down to the small intestine,large intestine and the bowel. 

Everything is joined together.Interestingly,the stomach and the bowel are one of the first things created in the fetus during the gestation period.That just shows how important that is-it's more important than our spine.But that area is very sensitive and when we get stressed, the stomach and the nerves within the stomach,the bowels and the small intestines are affected by the stress.There's nothing more powerful than stress to affect these areas. 

The lack of ability to be understood and the frustration surrounding that causes the stress.So we cause their stress by categorizing them and not thinking of them as being normal or supernormal.We can't communicate with them properly and they can't communicate with us properly,because we aren't operating on the same frequency levels or the same number of channels as them,this frustration manifests itself in a severe way.It's our lack of ability to understand them that creates their frustration,which creates their stress,which creates their problems with their bowels and intestines(10/2018). 

**What is the best way to treat it?Some children have had success with a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet,but others are prescribed drugs to control the disease?** 

In my understanding,show them love,show them understanding.Try to communicate with them properly and that will reduce the stress. That will reduce the need for any form of physical treatment,because these symptoms will go away,because they'll calm down.I think that's as simple as it is.It's simply we're creating their stress (10/2018). 

**This question is about anxiety in autistic people.I was supposed to pick my son at noon,but I was late for a few minutes.By the time I picked him up,he was having a meltdown.Why do they have so much anxiety in situations like this?Your insight is much needed.** 

Basically,we haven't told them we're late.Autistic individuals are incarnate souls who are operating on and communicating with lots and lots of different frequencies concurrently-many more than our five senses.When we don't communicate with them to advice them of something,which is outside of the parameter that we said we were going to do,they get upset,because they believed us. 

They are pure.They are absolute.When we say we are going to do something for an autistic individual and they can feel our energy associated with that commitment,when we don't commit to it,they get annoyed.They get frustrated,because they can't understand how we can say one thing and not do it. 

You can experiment on this-everybody who has autistic children, friends or family members.When we say we're going to do something and we can't fulfill that commitment,send out the energies,meditate on the individual explaining why it's going to be different to what was broadcast to them whether you're going to be late,whether what you're going to give them is not what you said,whether where you were going to go to is not where you said you were going,etc. 

Broadcast,telepathize that which you are going to do differently,so when you get to them,they already know that there's going to be a change or what that change is.When you get to them,they'll be calm, because then they know what that change is.There's no surprise to them.You are within the parameters that they now know is part of their new expectation(1/2021). 

**Why are people saying they can cure autism?Will this kind of protocol numb down the abilities or Source connection of autistic kids or adults?** 

You have to understand that the vast majority of the population of the Earth are deaf,dumb and blind.They are immersed in their incarnate state.Anything that is different to that is not natural.People generally consider their immersed incarnate state as being the norm and anything else needs to be "cured"to create the norm. 

Any drug-based therapies or anything else,like some forms of hypnosis that are designed to cut off the connectivity of what we call "autistic" individuals,which includes Down syndrome,Aspergers,etc.,is only going to stop them from functioning in the way they're supposed to be functioning. 

There is no physical cure for autism,because autism isn't an issue,it's a function.It's a higher function,a higher frequential function that these children or their souls are experiencing in that particular body in that growth state. 

Why try to cure something that doesn't exist as a fault,other than mankind in its ignorance thinks it is,because it's not what the general population are experiencing,therefore,it needs to be cured?If they try to cure it with chemicals or any other form of reprogramming,then all they're going to do is stop those souls from functioning properly in those bodies(5/2021). 

**If we try to reduce anxiety in autistic people via homeopathy or herbalism,is that okay?** 

The only way to reduce anxiety in autistic individuals is to understand them and work with them on their level,because they're communicating with us on multiple energetic levels as well as the five gross physical senses.Trying to work with them with homeopathy or herbalism is simply trying to apply a physical medication that is not too far removed from the western medicine side of things.If used properly, homeopathy could be used to let them know who they are,because the right homeopathic treatments would augment their connectivity. 

Somebody who is working with them can say,"Well,you need to understand that what you're experiencing is real for you and it is a real human response.But 99.9%of the current population of the Earth are not switched on as you guys."Then the homeopathy might assist in reducing the anxiety. 

But my feeling is that something like Psycho-Spiritual Programming would reduce the anxiety together with interaction with people who understand them and can support their thought process and justify their thought process to them.That would reduce the anxiety that they feel,because the anxiety is about not being accepted(5/2021).

### 自闭症谱系

### Backfill People 

They come from True Energetic Selves that have 80%sentience,which is an energetic genre between fully sentient humans (100%sentience)and animals (50%sentience).This is their first lifetime on Earth with individualized free will.They have been incarating here for about 60-70+ years.Their job is to maintain a critical mass of people on Earth during our ascension. 

**What are Backfill people?** 

Backfill people have an individual soul,but they are normally aligned to a collective when they incarnate.Outside the Earth sphere,they have collective will,but inside the Earth sphere,they are newly exposed to individualized free will,but they are still linked together collectively,since they tend to gravitate together. 

Biologically,they have identical human vehicles.It's just that they are inexperienced in incarnations with individualized free will.They are working and evolving here,but generally outside of karma,because they will not be needed for long.As we become aware and awake,we start to notice those who aren't awake,who are not engaged in their own personal progression or who go the other way to full materialism (6/2013). 

They have a different type of soul,a lower quality of soul or a lesser sentient soul,which is allowed incarnate in the human form to maintain a critical mass of individuals on this gross physical version of Earth.They are here to allow the higher quality of human soul to move beyond the need to incarnate in such a low frequency vehicle. 

The human vehicle will also move beyond this frequency set.It will no longer be a gross physical vehicle.It will become more gaseous or energetic in nature-returned to what it was several hundred millennia ago (12/2013). 

**Are backfill people only allowed to incarnate on the gross physical version of Earth,not the higher versions of"New Earths"at FB 4 or FB 5?** 

They are there to ensure that there is a balance maintained in the lower frequential version of the Earth to allow these other individuals that are slower at evolving to evolve.Eventually,when there are no individuals (fully sentient human energetic genre)existing on the gross physical version of the Earth(FB 1-3),then the need for backfill people will disappear.They will return to their normal evolutionary and incarnate locations within the physical universe(1/2016). 

**When will their function to keep the low frequencies here become obsolete?** 

I'm being told that it could be as long as 3,000 years.It just depends upon how fast those human souls who are not evolving as fast as others catch up with us.It could be as long as 3,000 years or as short as 1,200 years,so it depends.The thing is not to worry about others.It's to work on yourself and those who seek help from you,so you can be of service to them and help them move up. 

If there's still one soul that is working on the third frequency level, there will still be the need for that level to be populated by backfill people.That's the metric I'm being told to use.Don't forget that 1,200 years is not a long time when you're talking about our own state of being.It's quite a short time when we are in the energetic.It can go very,very quickly (1/2016). 

**Will that "3D world"be a mad world,because they are lower acting individuals?** 

No,it will maintain a level of functionality.Although the backfill people won't move onwards to the fourth level Earth (at FB 4)whilst here,they will gain a level of residual evolution as a result of working in this environment.They will move up the smaller subfrequencies at the third level,as they are working their way to become able to incarnate in fourth frequency bodies rather than in gross physical bodies(at FB 1-3).The backfill people will benefit from their function of maintaining the critical mass in service to the rest of the human souls who are still working on ascending out of this lowest version of Earth (1/2016). 

**I'd like to ask the Source about the 2016 American election,if he agrees that Donald Trump is the right contender for president,as there is lots ofchaos and evil around the world?** 

I'll just link in with Source first.The response is we should be mature enough now to be able to recognize that we need leaders who are thinking for us and about us rather than for themselves.This is irrespective of who the contenders are for any presidency,not just American presidency.If we see how one of those contenders is operating,then we don't vote for him.That individual has no power over us,only what we give him over us. 

This is a collective function and it's all to do with choice.It's giving us the opportunity to make the right choice,to go down the right road,to take the right event space and the right event stream.We talk about event streams in The Curators.It's all about choosing the right event stream. 

Source gives us everything-even evil as a function of choice.If we choose evil,then we need to experience it.It may be that we need to come back and unchoose it later or choose another route,another incarnation,because evil is ultimately a function of lower frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions. 

But we've also got the chance not to choose evil.If we choose somebody to be a president who is thinking of the collective population of the States or the rest of the world and what we're leaving for other incarnate individuals to work with,then we will vote for that individual. 

It's all about our choice.We're given opportunities:the right road,the wrong road,the best road,the slower road.It's up to us to make the right choice.We can't blame anybody else (9/2016). 

**You said backfill people were lower quality souls that get addicted to lower quality states,since they have never experienced free will. Does the lack of free will contribute to their inability to withstand addictive behaviors in the modern world?** 

Backfill people are here to keep the balance of individuals on this third level whilst people are ascending to the fourth level.It allows people who are still working on the third level to continue to work on the third level without wondering where everybody is going to basically.There has to be a level of population maintained on this planet. 

Although backfill people weren't common on Earth in the past,they are starting to become more and more common now,as we start to move up the frequencies,even though we are experiencing a slight downward trend at the moment. 

The backfill people are souls that are not the same quality as ours,but they are above the animal.The animal souls have one level of sentience (50%)and we have a different level of sentience (100%).The backfill people have a level of sentience that's in between the two(80%). 

This allows them to work in certain ways to animate the human form But they are not used to having total free will,because they have been working in a collective way rather than individually.On Earth they can work with the collective function if they wish or in a completely selfish way.They normally operate in a collective way,as described in Beyond the Source-Book 2. 

This type of soul can operate in two collective ways.One way is to be in a hive mind where everything is a part of a bigger brain.Every soul is part of a bigger soul-it can only act and respond as a smaller part of that bigger soul.They can react in an individual way when they've been assigned to do something,but that collection of souls have to agree with any suggestion made by that individual.When they are put in a position of total free will,it's a bit strange for them.They have not experienced it before.They get addicted to the ability to do anything and everything they want to do-often in a selfish way. 

They will be able to achieve what any of us can achieve-become pop stars,celebrities,athletes,actors or chief executive officers of banks and their own businesses.But they tend to get sucked into the materialistic aspect of things and sensory stimuli with lower frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions,because they don't have experience of it.They don't have the ability to see the right way from the wrong way or the efficient way from the inefficient way to evolve. 

They keep trying to test the waters to see how far they can go.They get easily addicted to drugs,alcohol,sex,food,wealth,power,celebrity status,materialism,etc.Some of them break free of their addiction and when they do,the whole group benefits.They're enjoying their evolution,but are finding it much harder,because it's a bit like a child in a candy shop.The temptation to steal the candy is overwhelming (8/2016). 

Backfill people are individuals who are of a different genre of sentience than us.They are experiencing individualized free will for the first time,so they would without a doubt become attracted to low frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions and sensory stimuli associated with being on this planet and the frequencies associated with it.Even they will eventually start to rise in frequency-it just takes a lot of"time"or event space(9/2017). 

**How about kids who are suddenly turning psychotic,taking weapons to school and killing their classmates and not adjusting or being told mentally something else?** 

They are backfill people.They can pick up astral entities very easily, because in most cases,it's their first time they've incarnated here.Thy are here to "backfill"or to maintain a critical mass of individuals on Earth at a lower level of frequency,so that we can continue our ascension and those who are behind us can also start to ascend. 

They're just basically getting intoxicated with lower frequency existence and thought processes and behaviors.If you can see them, they are aggressive.They use poor language.They get addicted to drugs and alcohol fairly easily.They get addicted to gang types of existences, those sort of things.They've got individualized free will,but no experience in being here.They get very,very easily,super easily attracted to low frequency conditions.But they're still evolving and experiencing stuff.Their purpose of being here will disappear when everybody else gets up to a certain level(6/2016). 

**This got me wondering about the purpose of our existence at the individual human level.I think I'm an Aspect,but then I could be a shard or a backfill person?** 

Most people who are asking these questions are aspects (souls).Shards (sub-souls)don't tend to ask these questions.Shards can be very successful from a materialistic perspective within the Earth environment and other physical environments within the universe. But they don't tend have the sentience associated with being able to question their environment,so anybody who is questioning things or participating in these Satsangas is most definitely an aspect(7/2019). 

**If backfill people have a "half-animal,half-human"soul,how could they be careless about nature?Doesn't half-animal part help them to remember the importance of keeping the balance and love of the nature?How can we help them to remember this?** 

That's not quite right.They are more than animal,but they're less than human,because of their sentience and energetic genre.But I suppose it's a reasonable way of describing it. 

When an individual-irrespective of whether they're a backfill or not- is immersed in their incarnation,it's like they're experiencing a dream, which they think is the reality.All of incarnation is an illusion.It's just that we choose to make it a reality.We choose to accept it as being what we are,so we turn illusion into reality.We do that in dreams as well. 

If you can wake up in a dream and start to manipulate it,then you can wake up in the next level of illusion,which is incarnation and start to manipulate it as well.That's what becoming self-aware is.The problem is that when you're so immersed in it,it doesn't matter how good you are,you can't wake up from this particular illusion,because you make it a reality.When a dream becomes a reality,we don't wake up from it. The illusion of the incarnation becomes a reality when we create it as a reality,when we accept it and don't question it and don't see beyond it. 

When we immerse ourselves into our incarnation or we're a lower level of sentience or a different genre of sentience,we naturally gravitate towards lower frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions.As a result of that,we have more difficulty in moving ourselves out of it.So really and truly,we can't force somebody to wake up.We can create ideas or plant thoughts in their minds or show them how to live,but this has to be done in a remote way as an example rather than a direct instructional way.

The only way we can help these people is by being us and showing and illustrating a better way to live,a better way to think,behave and act rather than actually sitting down and educating them,because that will be rejected.If you surround them enough by high frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions,eventually they will have their own frequencies raised through triangulation where a low frequency individual can start to have high frequency thoughts and a eureka moment,an aha moment or a self-realization moment. 

Sometimes it's very momentary,where all of a sudden a door is being opened.They've looked inside to the rooms and go,"Ah."Then the door is closed and they go,"Okay,there is something else."Then they can start to work with it.Leading by example is the best way forwards.You can't educate people,if they are totally immersed in their illusion and they've made that illusion reality.The only thing you can do is to illustrate through what you're doing and how you're doing it that the illusion is an illusion and it's not a reality (10/2019). 

**You told us that backfill people make up 12-15%of the population in 2019.Some have been put in leadership positions (e.g.D Trump,B Johnson).Is this the first multiverse cycle that backfill people are incarnating in human form?Were they used in previous cycles?** 

I'm being told this is the first time.The reason it's the first time is because this is the third evolutionary cycle.As a result of that,we are moving faster than in the second evolutionary cycle.The first two evolutionary cycles were progressing in speed,so the second was faster than the first and the third is faster than the second.There's a certain level of logarithmic progression associated with this.But in the first two evolutionary cycles,there wasn't a requirement for using backfill people to fill in the gaps,because people weren't ascending that fast. 

The way it's happening now,even though we're experiencing a low frequency condition,overall there's more people ascending to the next level and faster than in any other period in this cycle.This is the first time that backfill people have been included in the opportunity to have individualized free will in this location.It's their first time here (12/2019). 

**How do backfill leaders help us,if they bring us close to an existential crisis (e.g.nuclear weapons or world war)?Their authoritarian politics attract a cult of backfill people who want to see everything crash and burn (e.g.financial crisis,End Times, Rapture)?** 

It does and it doesn't.This is the first time backfill people have been allowed to incarnate here.As with other world leaders who have been classified as "antichrists,"it's simply an opportunity for us to see things going wrong and corrected.That's quite an evolutionary opportunity for us-to be the come back kids,so to speak.It gives us more evolutionary understanding about what we should be doing in the future in another event space than if we didn't experience it. 

When we let go of reins and let the horses run off at their own speed, we realize that they haven't got any direction.Then we have to take control of the reins again.In doing so,we learn something.We learn that we can't let go of the reins.We learn what happens when we let go of the reins.

That's important to understand,because to be able to progress,we need to be in control of ourselves first and then each other.That way we can progress in a much more accelerated rate,whereas if we don't do that, we end up being quite random.Although random is one route that we can go down,we don't really get to be efficient in our incarnation going way(12/2019). 

**What happens to our gross physical Earth in the hands of these Backfill people who don't care if the Amazon rainforest is burning or if we pollute our air,water and soil through fracking,dirty coal and fossil fuels?** 

We will eventually have to rebuild and repair the Earth.There's an old saying-you don't know what you've got until it's lost or it's gone. That's very relevant to people who lose their partners,but it's also relevant to people who lose their belongings,their homeland or things like trees around them.We've got examples around the world of what happens,if we don't behave.The deserts are a good example of how we've deforested certain parts of the world in previous eras. 

Unless we experience it ourselves,there are times where we don't understand what we're doing and how it affects other entities or the environment.Having to experience it and to realize what's gone wrong and then having to rapidly repair what we're doing wrong,so we don't crash and burn is part of our evolutionary progression. 

We're sort of starting to do that now,but if you look at the number of individuals who understand that we've got to look after the Earth vs. those who don't care,it's a horrible percentage difference.These people who don't care just say,"Well,I won't be around to experience it,it's nonsense,so it doesn't matter."This is completely wrong,because they're not protecting the environment for other people who want to incarnate and have a good environment to work with. 

What we need to do is to take hold of the possibility of a change,not politicize it and just think,behave and act in a way,which is going to allow us to maintain our environment,so that other incarnates can come to experience better it in the future.We need to act yesterday rather than tomorrow(12/2019) 

**Are the backfill people only going to incarnate once or will some of them reincarnate on this physical Earth,if it takes us longer than expected for us to ascend out of here?** 

What I'm picking up is that there's going to be a capped limit on the number of backfill people or backfill souls that are allowed to incarnate,because if you have a continuous throughput of new souls who haven't experienced individualized free will,they're all making the same mistake over and over again.If you allow a certain number of them to come in and they are allowed to incarnate again and again, they start to learn and evolve.There is self-correction coming into it. 

So it's not going to be completely new backfill souls that will incarnate, it will be the same souls-a capped limit of souls that are a critical mass -that are allowed to reincarnate multiple times,so they can experience,learn and evolve properly.The effects of their poor decision processes will be corrected by others and by them as well (12/2019). 

**You said that backfill people don't accrue karma,because they're not going to be around for thatlong.But 100-200+years seems like a long time to put humanity and the Earth in the hands of these service-to- self,materialistic characters seeking power,money,sex,etc.?** 

One hundred to two hundred years is nothing.In fact,we can't think in terms of years,we have to think in terms of the period it takes to get everybody with a human type soul up to the next level.Although it seems like a negative way forwards,it may possibly accelerate those people who are capable of going to the fourth level to go there faster.It may look negative,but actually a positive result comes out of it (12/2019). 

**Is that fair to the rest of humanity who is trying to ascend or the planet itself?Or the entities who choose to help the "laggard souls" still on this rapidly deteriorating Earth with climate change, pollution,overpopulation,etc.?** 

Because we're ascending individually and gradually,this is the only way forwards really.There has to be a critical mass of individuals on the planet that make the planet work in terms of the whole infrastructure that's been set up-from the cities to countries to technologies to companies to educational institutions.The whole thing needs to work and continue to work even when the last soul who hasn't moved from the third to the fourth frequency is still here on this planet. 

It is fair to the rest of humanity,but unfortunately it's a difficult thing to go through.When we start to see the errors of letting our hands off the reins and we get the reins back and start to control what we're doing,then we'll start to move up quickly.This period of using backfill people will get shorter,because the number of people who ascend to the fourth level will increase rapidly. 

We still won't have a sudden knife edge change where we all ascend in one go,because of a critical mass,but every individual will have an accelerated progression upwards.That can only be achieved through the use of backfill people.Once we've understood how to negate and counteract some of their thinking processes and they start to progress themselves,then we'll move up the frequencies faster and faster (12/2019). 

I've noticed a lot more backfill people around the world than previously.What's happening is that some people are disappearing out of view.They disappear and they're backfilled.Some of the backfill people are walk-ins-they walk into the body of someone who has ascended,so not everybody's body is disappearing from view.It's the souls that are moving on,so you may see some people who have changed in a noticeable way (4/2020). 

**The number of backfill people have been increasing from the original 8%of the population to an alarming 41%in 2020.You said they are located mostly in the western world.Does the U.S.have a larger percentage ofthem than China,Russia or Europe?** 

In general,where we have leaders who are not being properly responsible for who and what they are and for the people that they're governing is where most of the backfill people are going,because they're being allowed to exist in an area where they are accepted easily. The backfill people are more prevalent in areas where the leadership is quite frankly ineffective,where those leaders are put in a state where everything benefits them rather than the general populace.That's where they're most visible. 

In countries that are more progressive in understanding the self and how to work with the environment,backfill people won't be tolerated. They are affected by the higher frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions of others around them-people being more service orientated, more environmentally aware and active,working on technology that will benefit us,not take things away from us,not make us less responsible. 

Backfill people can sometimes be invisible,because they're affected in a positive way in areas where the overall population is more caring, sharing,spiritually aware and environmentally aware,so you don't see them so often.They're being held up frequentially by those around them,so you don't see them descend(11/2020). 

**You said they are located mostly in the western world?** 

The number of backfill people is mostly in the western world,not specifically in the U.S.,but it's evenly distributed.Certainly,it's more prevalent in areas where there is poverty,where people are focused upon their physical survival.That is where we start to see the increase in backfill people.This doesn't mean to say that they're bad people,it just means to say that they're more focused on being in the physical. They stand less chance of becoming aware and awake or self-realized or in fact,they don't become self-realized or aware and awake. 

I'm being given a couple of locations here,like Brazil and Mexico,where there's a lot of corruption.There's corruption everywhere in the world actually,so I don't know why those two countries were sorted out as examples of where there's a lot of difficulty in existing-lots of things happening that are wrong,governance that is wrong. 

It's difficult to survive,to have a good job or a good role.Moving out of the squalor,which can happen anywhere in the world,is difficult to get out of,because of the environment and the individuals around it.These places tend to perpetuate this potential area,so backfill people have a zero chance of getting any better and even really evolved people have a difficult chance in getting better there. 

Backfill people living in more enlightened environments tend to absorb that enlightenment as well,but not to the same level as a human soul. In general,backfill people tend to be located where materialism is the dominant way of existing.Materialism is an addictive function,a karmic function that everybody can get addicted to(12/2020). 

**We now have 7.8 billion people on Earth in 2020.What percentage are backfill people?What percentage are shards?What percentage are aspects?What percentage of the total population can collectively change an event space through meditation?** 

We know the percentage of aspects needed,because 144,000 as a percentage of 7.8 billion people is that number.It's quite a small percentage.That figure of 144,000 as a percentage of 7.8 billion is the number of aspects that need to be here to create a change. 

Of the 7.8 billion,how many are real aspects?An aspect (soul)is a smaller aspect of sentience and energy from a True Energetic Self.I'm being shown that all aspects created by the Source,including the hybrid Om are about 56%of the world's population. 

What percentage of them are shards?A shard (sub-soul)is an incarnate entity that's created through the division of sentience and energy from an aspect,so it's a smaller aspect of an aspect.I'm surprised to see it's about 3%.There's a lot of shards on the planet,as 3%of 7.8 billion is a lot.I'm being told the shards are in decline. 

If we have 56% of people that are aspects (souls)and 3% of the total population are shards(sub-souls),on top of that we have a rather large number of backfill people.I'm being told it's 41%backfill people.The backfill people are those individuals who don't have the same quality of TES as those classified as being human TES,because they're in between the human and animal TES.They are "backfilling"to allow the rest of incarnate mankind to ascend to the fourth frequency level. 

There's going to be a question at the back of people's minds,"Well,I'm a spiritual person,why am I still here?"Some individuals are naturally high frequency or work on themselves to be high frequency.Some of them don't have a desire to stay here,so they ascend up the frequencies, whereas others who are actively doing something have subconsciously agreed to stay here.If you're a spiritual person and working in the light, then you're here to help others. That's a large number-41%are backfill people and only 3% are shards. 

That's surprised me,as I would have expected more shards.I'm being told that some of the incarnate aspects don't always have 2.5% of TES sentience that you'd expect a soul to have,so they could be classified in the shard/sub-soul level,but they're not.Okay,so very interesting thought process there(5/2020). 

**What is the percentage of backfill people on Earth in July 2022?It was 41% in May2020.** 

It's about 55%.I was thinking the other day that the rise of the backfill people is an interesting comment that I almost said in jest.But it really is the rise of the backfill people.You can see it all over the world where people are driving without care or attention.They're doing things without concern for themselves or their children or their parents. They're eating food,which isn't good for them.They're doing pastimes, which is thrill seeking.They are extremely materialistic. 

Those who are of higher sentience,although they might indulge in some of these things,they realize at some point that it's not the way forwards to perpetuate a more mature way of thinking,behaving, acting and evolving.The people that become more mature start to rise through the frequencies and depart their incarnation naturally or move into the frequencies that we can't perceive.They're still there, but they're only interacting with other incarnates at that higher frequency rather than here unless they want to interact with those of a lower frequency. 

The backfill people are in between the sentience associated with the standard human being (100%)and the animal (50%),so they're in the middle (80%).The ability to experience individualized free will hasn't been available to them until very recently,maybe the past 50 years. With the rise of the backfill people,we're starting to see their volumes increasing and see a change in the population.It's growing ridiculously fast.From 41%to 55%in two years,that's 14%in two years(7/2022).

**In The Curators Source talks about a few low frequency incarnates having sporadic contact with us.Does this explain the "negative contacts"that some humans have had with aliens?** 

Yes.There's some backfill people who are also not quite here,but are here,so to speak.Some of the backfill souls are in different incarnate vehicles that aren't human,so they can come from different locations within the galaxy or the universe as well. 

When we have a negative contact,we have to understand that some of these contacts are based upon our desire to work with some souls in different incarnate vehicles.Sometimes they're part of our primary incarnation in another form factor(species),so they're just monitoring the human form here."Abduction"is the same as us going into the wild,taking an animal out of the wild,taking its blood pressure, temperature,other measurements and tagging it,so its habits can be tracked down by us.The abduction is the same thing that is not negative per se,but is mostly misunderstood(7/2020). 

**You said that about 54%ofincarnates have more than one soul in one vehicle.Does this 54%include regular aspects,their shards and backfill people?** 

Usually,an incarnate vehicle or body has the same quality of sentience that is animating the body.For instance,if a body is animated by an aspect (soul),then you would find that any other aspects that are experiencing the incarnation in a passive way would be aspects as well. We wouldn't get any shards,because it's not beneficial-the ability to observe is different for a shard.The same for a backfill person.If you've got any souls that are sharing a body,they tend to be of the same genre or quality of sentience(8/2020). 

**If backfill people have four rotating backfill souls in one body,how are they assessed for evolutionary progression?** 

Backfill souls are just a different quality of sentience.The function of being incarnate is identical,so it doesn't matter what level of sentience you have-whether it's a soul classified as human or backfill or animal. The souls share a body in a similar way-some are active or passive, some walk in or rotate out of a body.They gain evolutionary progression from it,even if they're a passive observer.There is no change to the rules. 

With animals,they tend to operate in a more collective way rather than an individualized way.But any interaction with a lower frequency environment in any way results in some level of evolutionary progression(8/2020). 

**In The Curators you describe backfill people as transient individuals that were created by us to 'fill in'the gaps in the background of our existence and experience.Do we actually consciously create these people?If so,why do I have no recollection ofthis activity?** 

The backfill people are a different quality of sentience.They're a different True Energetic Self genre.They're a different soul type.By transient,it means that they are not going to go into the vast series of incarnations that the vast general population of the Earth and the vast general population of the physical universe at all these frequencies are going to go through.

They are experiencing individualized free will,but they will evolve in a completely different way.They won't be going through the process of getting rid of lots of karma,although they will accrue karma as well. They fulfill the role of backfilling or recreating the population of the environment,so that the human level incarnates (aspects or shards) can work without the shock of seeing the population dramatically reduce. 

As we go up the frequencies to the fourth level,for instance,we zone out of the perceptual range of those people who stay at the third frequency.Their role is to be here and create a balance of population whilst the rest of us ascend into the next level in this incarnation or another incarnation. 

They are not part of our creation.We haven't created them.Source has created them.They are part of the original creative process of the Source when it split out and individualized countless billions units of sentience and energy to create all the TESs.But they're only here whilst we move to the next level.They still evolve in their own way as a function of being here.But they won't have to go around all the different depths and details of karma that we do. 

You can see that they are attracted to karmic things.They're attracted to materialism and low frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions, which are part of their beingness.But that's okay,because they're spared a lot of the recovery processes that we have to go through to remove our karmic links with certain circumstances and certain individuals in certain environments(1/2021). 

**We understand that backfill people come from a different type of TES and are transient.Do they reicarzzate in human form on Earth like us?Do they accrue Karma as human beings and if so,how do they dissolve their karma?You said they process it differently.** 

My new understanding is that the backfill people only generally incarnate once,because there's such alot of them.They incarnate once and their karma is dissolved by the rest of us.Although they accrue karma very quickly,because they don't know how to handle individualized free will,we absorb it for them.They are not responsible for karmic dissolution,because it's absorbed by everybody else. 

We absorb it readily,because they're doing us a service.They're backfilling for those individuals who have ascended in order to maintain the environment in a state of "normality"for those who haven't ascended yet.We're quite happy to take on-board the karma that they accrue(2/2021). 

**Do they evolve through the entire physical universe or stay at levels FB 3 and FB 4? Ifnot,what is the maximum of their evolution?** 

Everything evolves.Everything will evolve through its own evolutionary cycle,if it is in an evolutionary cycle or if it's attached to a part of an environment that is within an evolutionary cycle.They will experience what they need to experience in the way they can experience things.That would include the entire physical universe at certain levels.They can quite easily incarnate at different frequency levels,not just FB 3 or 4,but they can go up to FB 6 or 7 or 8(2/2021). 

**Are they normally hive souls like animals and plants?**

They normally incarnate in a collective function.They tend to be more in communion as an incarnate soul.Even though they may have little bits of individualized will,that will can only operate,if it's in the best interests of the collective that it's part of.So it's not like us where we can do anything that we want to and I mean anything individually. There's no controls over what we allow those who govern us to control us with.Backfill people are inherently controlled by a collective function-things must benefit the collective(2/2021). 

**You said backfill people accrue karma very quickly,because they don't know how to handle individualized free will.They are not responsible for dissolution of their karma,because it is being reabsorbed by everybody else.If animals accrue karma,why are backfill people exempt?** 

Animals tend to accrue karma because of our interaction with them,so that's there because of us.Sometimes they come into incarnation with fears based upon how they've been mistreated by man.But they can also come into incarnation with positive karma based upon how well mankind has interacted with them(3/2021). 

**You told us Donald Trump is a backfill president.Is his karma being reabsorbed by those who voted for him?Or all of us,even those who see him as a poster boy for karma?** 

In this instance,we all are,not just those who vote for somebody.We help clear the karma of every backfill person,because they are there to assist,to be of service to us in totality.They are helping those who haven't ascended to the next level to achieve that level of ascension in this level of frequency.They're there to maintain the base population on the Earth,so that those who haven't ascended yet to the next frequency level can do so(3/2021). 

**In one Satsanga you said that backfill people are not in the reincarnation cycle and that they incarnate once and leave.In another Satsanga you said some of them will be allowed to reincarnate andthey do accrue karma?** 

It's very rare that those backfill people come back.The vast majority (99.9999%)of backfill people don't come back,so in this instance somebody who creates karma is allowed to have that karma dissolved. But those who do come back show the possibility of benefiting,because they have not responded in the average way.They're allowed to come back,because they've got merits and they are showing evolutionary progression.They could eventually be able to reincarnate and clear their own karma,as it's accrued,but then they would have significant help from their guide and helpers(3/2021). 

**During your interview a year ago with "Beyond the Veil,"you said that "backfill people"and "backdrop people"are two different genres. Is that correct?** 

Backfill people are an aspect of a different quality of sentience than what we classify as a human soul.It's lower than the human soul in its quality of sentience,but higher than the animal soul.It's there to allow the human aspects to ascend to the next frequential level without there being a shocking,surprising and worrying sudden loss of population around the world.As one person moves up the frequencies into the fourth frequency level whilst incarnate,a backfill person is born or walks into another body. 

They have their own opportunity to experience,learn and evolve with individualized free will.They don't get many opportunities to do it- maybe once,maybe twice,because there's that many of them,same as us. 

They don't go into the karmic cycle irrespective of how "good"or"bad" they are from a human perspective,they don't accrue karma.That's because they're providing a service for us.They're keeping the audience in the cinema whilst the actors still do their roles and move. As each member of the audience leaves and goes to the circle,those in the stalls get backfilled by backfill souls. 

Backdrop people don't actually exist.The backdrop people are something that Dolores Cannon talked about.She thought initially that backfill and backdrop people were the same thing,but they're different things.The backdrop people are basically us creating a backdrop to the environment that we're in. 

Wherever we are,we create an environment that we exist within.We collectively sign up for this environment or the event stream within the event space that creates the reality.We are pretty much localized except with those around us,so we collectively create that which we desire to see,e.g.housing,states,parks,farms,boats,all these different things. 

The individuals that we see in the distance are part of the background, part of our collective desire to fill those spaces with animate objects, including animals as well.So they're not the same thing.One is created by us and exists on a very temporary basis,whilst we are focused on it. The other is a different genre of sentience that is allowed to incarnate and backfill for those souls that move to the next level(7/2021).

### Bipolarism 

Bipolarism is usually a function of having two souls within the same body. Typically,one soul is active and one soul is passive.Sometimes the souls may alternate for command and control ofthe vehicle in various ways. 

**How do we deal with somebody who is bipolar?** 

All you can do is be cognizant of what's happening with them.Log into them,but don't get worried about them or aggressive or upset with them when they do something that is out of character that would upset you,because of the relationship you have with them. 

If they say something that is completely out of context,don't get upset with them.Just think to yourself,it's just a temporary walk-in event or is this particular walk-in going to be a bit more permanent.It's a matter of really rising above the initial shock or the cold faced reaction and working with them in the best way that's going to help them by you knowing what's going on with them(11/2013). 

**How do we deal with attachment oflow frequency astral entities?** 

A good healer can remove a low frequency astral entity and heal the energies associated with the interface that those entities have created to suck energy out of that particular person.I've removed countless low frequency entities from people I know as a healing during a reading,when I've spotted something was there(11/2013). 

**Is every case of Bipolar Disease associated with two souls sharing one body?Does it happen from birth(shared vehicle)or is it acquired later in life as a walk-in?** 

There are times when a body is assigned with 3,4,5 or 6 souls-the primary soul to control or animate that vehicle and then a walk-in can happen at any time after birth to just before death.It can be there for 2 minutes or 2 hours or 2 years or 2 decades. 

There's no real rules as to how a walk-in appears or disappears.It just depends on what the soul animating the vehicle and the other soul(s) have agreed upon before the incarnation. 

In terms of the shared vehicle,the souls may be sharing the body from the start,for instance,four souls that may be constantly using the body from the start of the incarnation to the end of the incarnation.Or they could be there before birth and then a walk-in can happen at any time. There's no specific time frame when that could happen.It's just whenever there was an agreement as to the correct juncture is available in the incarnation for it to move in.These are all planned events. 

Sometimes there is an unplanned walk-in by a soul that wants to experience the sensations of a body under the influence of drugs or alcohol.These substances compromise or damage the natural protective function of the human aura and chakras,so the other soul can temporarily walk in.But it would have to walk-out as soon as the protective function of the chakras and auras return.Once the body moves back into harmony to what it's supposed to be,then the other soul can't stay,because the primary soul has to move back into the body unless there is an agreement between those two souls,so the other soul can stay there (1/2016). 

**What is the preferred method to deal with Bipolar Disease? Prescription medicines or psycho-spiritual healing or both?** 

The best way to deal with it is to have the therapist communicate with both of those souls (or three souls or four souls)together and gain an agreement that they will become passive.Those who are supposed to be passive will go to being passive and those that aren't passive that are supposed to be the animating or the primary soul regain that status. 

That can be done through the Quantum Healing Hypnosis Therapy created by Dolores Cannon or by a very good energy healer that can communicate with all the souls and interact with the body energetically to re-establish the demarcation lines between the passive souls and the dominant function of the primary soul that is supposed to be animating that body.A good healer can reassign or repair the walls that may have been broken down in between the areas associated with passive interaction vs.animation or primary control of the vehicle. 

This sort of healing process is preferred to the medical function, because the drugs create an energetic imbalance,which has the effect of driving the souls,even the primary soul,away from the energy associated with the human form.All it's doing is reducing the interaction with the body through creating energetic disharmony.It's almost like you're drugging the body to the point where it's constantly intoxicated.That level of intoxication is abhorrent to these souls, including the primary soul,not just the passive souls(1/2016). 

**Are those souls driven to be sort of out-of-body in some astrallevel?** 

I'm being told they're moved into the 8th,9th and 10th levels(FB 8-10), where they are outside of the ability to animate the body,but still within the energies associated with the body.Remember the 8th,9th and 10th energies are the "step down function"from the True Energetic Self to the human vehicle to allow the soul or aspect to be projected into it.But those three levels don't have any auric layers or chakras associated with them,so they don't have the same level of connectivity as the 7th,6th,5th,4th,3rd,2nd and 1st levels do. 

The souls are not in the astral levels,which are at FB 4-7.They are external to the human vehicle,but still within this sphere of energy that is associated with the creation of the vehicle.The souls are not driven totally out,they're just driven out of the way of control.It's a little bit like putting them in a different room from the control room with all the control mechanisms(1/2016). 

**A bipolar person has two souls in one body where one soul is meant to be active and the other is passive.How are these two souls positioned or demarcated within the body?** 

There are two whole souls occupying one physical vehicle.There is no hybrid function or composite function,it is two souls occupying the same body,except that one is active and one is passive.Sometimes you can get them changing over where the one that's passive becomes active and the one that was active becomes passive. 

That's a malfunction in terms of the agreements between the souls as to who is going to be the observer and who is going to be the experiencer.That usually happens with two souls that are inexperienced in using the same body(2/2016). 

**Where do their soul energies sit(e.g.soul seat or elsewhere)?** 

When I work with people who've got problems associated with multiple soul aspects in the same body,I tend to see a room where one is in the control room and the other(s)are in the observation room.But that's just how I'm interpreting the information associated with how to turn those in the control room back into the observation room,so I tend to see it that way. 

In terms of how we normally incarnate,the energy comes through a little vortex or tube called the Hara line and goes near the crown chakra down through the body and coalesces at the tan tien (around 75 mm or 3 inches above the navel and 3 inches into the center of the body). That's where the energy starts to disperse.The energy associated with the soul occupies the energy lines and becomes associated with the major/minor/mini chakras and the meridians that allow the communication between the soul and the body.Both souls sit there at the same time. 

If one soul is driving the body,then the energies to drive the body stay in the tan tien.But if another soul is driving the body,then that doesn't happen.It's like it's there but it's not there.It's cut off,so to speak.It has to stay there,because that's where it is,but the sentience associated with that energy for both the driving soul and the passive soul goes into the sou/seat,which sits right behind the heart chakra (front aspect).This is where you see the sentience of the souls. 

The difference is one sentience is connected to the tan tien and has access to the motor functions of the human form,whereas the other one has sentience in the soul seat and has access to its energies within the tan tien.If you remember,the sentience uses energy to move around,but it doesn't have access to the motor functions of the human body.But sometimes,there's a little bit of a change of desire,so to speak,and they can be swapping around. 

If the life plan of that body for those two or three or four souls is such that each of the souls can gain access to the motor functions of the body,then they will do that.But in general,the energies sit in the tan tien and the sentience sits in the soul seat.The tan tien is above the navel and the soul seat is just behind the heart chakra,so they're in the same place basically.It's just that one has got access to certain functions and the other doesn't (2/2016). 

**How do you heal a bipolar person by rearranging their soul demarcations within the human form?** 

This is purely how I'm interpreting my experience or my vocabulary of what I'm seeing.I see them in two rooms.What I tend to do is communicate with that soul and move its sentience or its connectivity out of the control room into the observation room.You could argue that you take them from the driving seat of the car and put them in the back seat of the car.What works for me might work in a different way for a different healer,what they're seeing and how the souls are connected. 

But clearly,there is a metaphoric function of what's happening rather than the actual function of what's happening.Sometimes the spiritual- user interface associated with healing is much simpler than the actual connectivity and the work we do as healers. 

For instance,the act of communicating with the two souls is done by moving one soul out of the driving seat and putting it in the back seat and then moving the other soul from the back seat into the driving seat of the car.This may actually be creating a link between the energies associated with the tan tien and the sentience of one soul. 

That allows them to connect with the motor functions of the body's muscles,neurons,ligaments,etc.,and to have connectivity to the rest of the chakras,meridians,etc.The other soul is reassigned by using the same steps to withdraw its connectivity from the structures and locking it into the tan tien with no connection to the outside world.The actual work could be a lot more detailed compared to using the metaphoric function of just swapping the drivers around.It depends on how the healer works as to how it works. 

My experience is that if you get a feeling of how to interact with a patient and you're given imagery,then that imagery is the gateway into healing them or the gateway into your presence (either physical or energetic)allowing them to heal themselves,if they desire to be healed. 

If you get a complicated procedure presented to you,then use that procedure.If you've got something that's like a cartoon or metaphoric, then use that.They both work the same.It's just that one could be classified as a pretty user-interface,whereas the other is adjusting the code behind the user interface in computer language,so to speak (2/2016) 

**I am diagnosed Bipolar.I was developing "siddhis"or psychic-like abilities that were like spiritual awakenings.Is there any spiritual merit to these experiences?Were the siddhis just delusions?I am seeking closure as to what was real and what was not?** 

It's a very good question.I've no doubt there are lots of people who'll want the answers to it.I'm just logging into you right now and my feeling is that they were real.But you've got enough wherewithal to realize the ego could latch onto it and use it for its own command and control of you by aggrandizing what you've experienced to making you feel bigger than you are.But you're checking it out and making sure you're happy with it,which means that you are in control.The chances of the ego saying,"I'm now self-aware and self-realized and a better person"is reduced. 

Bipolarism sometimes allows us to move into higher levels of consciousness,but it's not robust,it's quite erratic.As a result,it is a bit difficult to work with,because we don't know when we're going to move into these highs or lows.The high frequency conditions give us the objective to be very highly connected and in a state of rapture, because it is a bliss state.Then we come down the other side of it and we're put into a low frequency and we're suffering cold turkey from it. My feeling is that it's not a robust way of experiencing self-realization or the greater reality,because it's not controllable. 

What you can do is to try to figure out what thought processes and what states of beingness you went through that causes you to go to these higher frequency conditions and allows you to get into the higher levels of functionality and communicative ability.That way you can try to control it.You can say,"Okay,what happened in these conditions?What was the common denominator in these three different scenarios that put me into that level?"Then write it down and just see if you can experiment by doing similar things and see if you can repeat it. 

If you can repeat it,then that's another way to achieve it rather than using meditation or projecting the sentience or the consciousness into the rest of the multiversal environment,which is what the Traversing The Frequencies work does.Based upon that,try to recreate those circumstances,write them down,so you can go and do them again faithfully. 

Bear in mind that you might have missed some circumstances-no matter how small the circumstance or the interaction with Self or others might be,write it down.Don't write anything off as being too small or too big.Just write it down and see if you can reproduce it. 

I'm looking forward to find out if you've managed to reproduce it, because that might help you personally.But also it might help those other individuals with a bipolar condition who are experiencing higher connectivity within the greater reality or connection with Source and then slamming back down to the Earth frequencies(2/2020). 

**In Bipolarism,are the two souls guided by one guide or two guides,if both souls take turns animating the body at different phases of life? Do both souls have to connect to the tan tien to animate the physical body?Or can they do it through the soul seat?** 

My understanding is that in Bipolarism,it's almost like both souls have integrated at the tan tien level.Their sentience sits at the soul seat and the initiation of the connectivity with the incarnate human vehicle happens at the core star,but the energy that animates the body is at the tan tien.In this instance,the sentience of the second soul is not a backseat passenger in a passive sense or in observation mode,because they've both integrated,so they would both have a guide each. 

Clearly,we only want to have one personality or one soul animating the body,but sometimes one soul decides to become the dominant soul vs.the other soul,which was supposed to be dominant soul.They have a little bit of a disagreement as to who should be the dominant soul.In this case,there's two souls that shouldn't have but have integrated fully with the body,so they would have a guide each. 

The guides are working out along with their helpers what to do when one soul takes over the animation of the body.Note that in Schizophrenia,there's more than one soul fighting for control of the human vehicle,but those souls collectively integrate in a different way to Bipolar conditions(7/2020). 

**You told us when there is more than one aspect in a body,no guide is needed for the passive aspect-passive meaning the soul that is not in the driver's seat.Is that correct?** 

Think of a motor vehicle as our body and the driver as the soul that animates the body.When we have other souls with us sometimes, they're either temporary walk-ins or they are simply a passive soul experiencing what we're experiencing,but not able to interact or animate the body,so they're like backseat passengers.That's one way to think about it. 

When we have souls that are animating or interacting with the body in terms of moving the body around and interacting with other individuals in their environment,then they have a guide as well.If they are totally passive,then there's no need for a guide,because they're just in an observation mode.But if they are interacting with others in the environment,then they have a guide of their own. 

They clearly all benefit from each other's work,even from observing you accrue some level of evolutionary progression,so there's a little bit of cumulative and synergetic evolutionary growth there.But most of the growth is done by the interaction within the physical environment by the soul or aspect that is animating the body(8/2020). 

**Since our progress is faster in the physical world,what are the benefits of multiple souls in one body,when one soul is in the driver's seat?Do the other souls consider the main soul's actions,responses and experiences as their own?** 

The benefit is not specifically for the soul that's driving the body or animating the body.Although there is an element of evolutionary content that comes with sharing the body,it's mainly to do with allowing the other souls to experience what you're experiencing but in a passive way.There are levels of progression associated with just being passive,just being in the body and observing,because we're observing it in the same way as a soul. 

If it went into the Akashic records-that part of the Source's sentience that's associated with all of the cumulative experiences of souls who are incarnate into the human vehicle only-then interacting with that in an immersed way allows the individual soul to gain some level of evolutionary progression as well.This is simply,because we're interacting with an environment albeit in a passive way and observing other individuals interacting within that environment and with themselves in a way that they didn't or haven't done themselves.As we see and as we observe,we do learn and we do evolve at the same time (8/2020). 

**You said that about 54% of incarnates have more than one soul in one vehicle.Does this 54%include regular aspects,their shards and backfill souls?** 

Usually,an incarnate vehicle or body has the same quality of sentience associated with it that is animating the body.So if a body is animated by an aspect (soul),then you would find that any other aspects that are experiencing the incarnation in a passive way would also be aspects. We wouldn't get any shards,because the ability to observe is different for a shard,so it's not beneficial.The same for a backfill soul. 

So if you've got any souls that are sharing,they tend to be of the same energetic genre or quality of sentience. 

For instance,if a shard is occupying a body,any walk-ins or passive souls would be shards as well.If a backfill individual was animating a body and they had any walk-ins or any passive backfill souls occupying the body,they would be only backfill souls as well.We tend to find that sentience sticks with sentience.Sentient quotient or the quality of sentience stays together,because that's a function of their evolutionary progression. 

You don't tend to go down,but you tend to go up or you can stay stationary.In Beyond the Source books,there was an indication where it was possible to de-evolve and you could argue that dropping down the frequencies is devolution.But in the bigger picture,we tend to only go upwards or we can be static (8/2020).  

**Is it possible to partition or separate two aspects or souls residing in one incarnate body or vehicle?If so,wouldn't that interfere with their life plan?** 

If there are more than one soul in the body where one soul is animating the body and the other two souls are passive and then they decide to have a go at animating the body and interacting within the environment and they start to jostle for position,they're going against their life plan. In general,a soul will be compartmentalized into the role that they are playing.For instance,if a soul is animating a body,it's compartmentalized into doing that.If a soul is just a passive observer, it's compartmentalized into that role.If they move from one to another as part of the overall plan,that's okay.They get to move from one compartment to another compartment. The compartmentalization is simply a way of interaction with the incarnate vehicle-whether it's the human vehicle here or other human vehicles around the physical universe.Think of them in terms of putting them in a room.Sometimes when I'm doing my healing,I'll have to re-establish the pecking order or priority of different souls in the body and that's the sort of imagery I use.It's like turning certain functions off in terms of how a soul can interact with the vehicle that they're associated with(8/2020).

### Chakras and Energetic Templates 

Chakras are energy centers within our human form that bring in life force energy from the sea of energy around us.The gross physical body is created from seven energetic templates around it. 

**What is prana or life force energy?** 

Free energy (or prana,qi,ki)is everywhere.It is energy that has not been given function,but it's always there for use.It pervades the Origin,therefore,it pervades our Source Entity and everything within it.

From our perspective,it's what our incarnate vehicle uses to perpetuate its existence.The human form is designed to use this energy at many frequency levels.It cannot function without this life force energy. 

The gross physical body (at FB 1-3)uses physical foods (plant and animal based products)as fuel,but the spirituo-physical bodies(at FB 4- 7)and the energetic levels(at FB 8-10)use prana to sustain themselves. The seven chakras work like narrow band receivers to pick up a specific set of frequencies from the sea of free energy around us. 

Each chakra works with one particular frequency band (e.g.root/FB 1, sacral/FB 2,solar/FB 3,heart/FB 4,throat/FB 5,third eye/FB 6,crown/FB 7).They funnel the energy into the energetic form to create a "composite energy"(or a mixture of frequencies)that is used to energize and animate the body in addition to the physical food and drink we consume.When the body demises,all the life force energy associated with the human form is removed and recycled back to Source as free energy in its purest sense(11/2012). 

**When we do physical exercises with the body,how does this affect our frequencies?** 

Exercise is generally associated with a thought process whether we want to look good or maintain fitness or make sure body is in good condition,so we can work with any challenge coming our way.All of this stuff is based on a misunderstanding of how we can increase the energetic function of physical body through an exercise program, which is an egotistical program. 

If exercise is done properly with the right techniques,good breathing, energization exercises or kriya yoga exercises,then we're able to use physical exercise with the right mental aspect to increase the functionality and energetic content of the physical form. 

If we understood how to do a certain exercise in a certain way with a certain thought process,we would attract energies to the physical form,and therefore,energize the physical form or give it energy. 

If this is done properly,then we wouldn't need to bring in the physical energies from eating food,because we would generate energy from the energetic system-70%of which we don't see (e.g.chakras,meridians, etc.).That energy can go into the physical and sustain the physical without fuels or metabolism to work,because it works with prana(free energy,orgone,cosmic energy)that is free.We're part of it. 

Physical exercise is good for the physical form,but if we worked with right type of exercise,training,thought process,then we could do a better job of the exercise regime,not only in terms of the physical form,but also the energetic form that gets exercised as well.Try to find exercises based upon the energetic situation.Getting information from Source will help you understand how to sustain the body in energy (6/2013). 

**What are the mechanics of creating the physical body from the energetic templates?Are we a holographic projection or what?** 

The etheric body (at frequency band 1)is like the energy matrix that contains all the information from the previous six templates above it (at FB 2-7).Each template contains the data from their specific frequency level at their level of finitude that allows the physical body to be created. 

The physical form is actually a gross physical mirror image of what is created by the etheric body,which has all the functions together from FB 7 to FB 1.In effect,the etheric body programs the gross physical body through the RNA and DNA,which have two functions both at the higher energetic or "spiritual"levels and lower energetic or gross physical levels. 

The spiritual function of RNA is to take all the information from the etheric template (at FB 5)and communicate and program it to the DNA. The nuclear DNA then broadcasts that information to the gross physical aspect of the RNA,which transports it to cell proteins and stem cells and T cells,etc.and all these things.These cells receive the programming go away to become liver cells,heart cells,eye cells,bone cells,muscle cells,skin cells and all these different things. 

When it's created properly,that information is then broadcast back through the gross physical function of the RNA to the DNA and then through the spiritual functions of the RNA back to the etheric side to say it's been built and completed properly. 

When you get a cancer growing,the dysfunctional energies of the cancer are like a Trojan horse or a Trojan virus in a computer.They send all the right communication back to all the right levels of interconnectivity to say,"I'm a liver cell,I function as a liver cell.I've been programmed as a liver cell,and therefore,I send back information to say I'm a liver cell." 

But its actual function is masked.It is disharmonious or diverged from its true function,so we get cancer cells growing.They multiply and mask themselves as liver cells.They're so good at disguising themselves,there is no disharmony felt in their energy.Eventually,the body gets taken over by this dysfunctional gross physical condition (9/2014). 

**How exactly does RNA get programmed from spirit to act as an interface for the body or auric layers?** 

The RNA controls the DNA and feeds back information from the energetic side to the physical and back again.Scientists recognize 12 different versions of RNA and those RNAs do affect the DNA.We're starting to see more things,as we get more adept in science and technology.We're starting to recognize that today's spiritual science is tomorrow's hard science (3/2014). 

In essence,the RNA has a dual function.It's both spiritual/higher energetic and gross physical or lower energetic.The RNA has two roles: to interface with the etheric body,which is the lowest frequency (FB 1) associated with the base or root chakra.It takes that programming and passes it on to the DNA.The DNA then passes on the gross physical programming via the gross physical aspect of the RNA to the cell proteins or stem cells or T cells,as the case may be.Then the body grows in that programmed way,so it's quite a clean way of working. 

The RNA doesn't interface with the auric layers per se,it only interfaces with one of the energetic templates called the etheric body (at FB 1). The etheric body is the product of the all the other templates all together.So rather than RNA being an interface to all of the templates, it's interfaced to one of the templates,which is the etheric body (9/2014). 

**Can mutated genes be corrected or manipulated by epigenetic ways, such as genes that predispose a person to Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer,etc.?**

In other words,can a gene or a cell or any form of DNA that creates cancer,Alzheimer's,Parkinson's or any disease be manipulated,so they function in the way they're supposed to function? 

Yes,but ultimately,they have to be reprogrammed within the energetic templates starting from the top down.They have to be programmed all the way down from the ketheric template (FB 7)to the celestial body (FB 6),etheric template(FB 5),astral body(FB 4),mental body (FB 3),emotional body (FB 2)to the etheric body (FB 1).All these templates have to contain the right information that tells these genes or cells are operating correctly. 

If they are operating incorrectly,two things need to happen.First, those genes need to be told to go through apoptosis or programmed cell death or self-demise.The new cells that replace them need to be created with the functionality and ability to interact with other cells or genetic conditions. 

As energy healers or with other forms of healing,we can affect the seven energetic templates associated with the gross physical,which include the first three layers(FB 1-3),the spirituo-physical levels(FB 4- 7),which is the "melting pot"between the gross physical and the energetic levels. 

When all seven templates all modified,then the gross physical will follow suit.If we understand and work with this as a healer,we can start to reverse the generation of these defective or mutated genes. They start to die off and get replaced by fully functioning cells and genes that are exactly what the body should be having rather than these genetic mutations. 

If we were to look at it from an energy healing perspective,we would work on the different levels and work on regenerating organs.When I was working on the Barbara Brennan healing science,my teacher (Helen Stott)taught us that we had to effect change on each of those levels naturally.If a healer understands this-irrespective of how fast or slow they are or whether they do them individually or collectively together-the energy healer should be able to eradicate a cancer or a disease,such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,purely by energy healing. 

The problem we get is that sometimes these illnesses are supposed to be experienced,because they are part of the person's life plan.It may be the way that the person leaves the incarnation,because it's part of their exit plan.In that case,we will not be able to heal the condition,because we are acting against the overall life plan and its downstream functions.We need to recognize that and work with that (9/2014). 

**Can we learn to self-heal these mutated genes?Or manage the disease,if not cure it?** 

Yes,we can,but again it depends upon our life plan.We can heal ourselves,if we're supposed to heal ourselves.If our life plan is designed to say that we need to experience this and survive it,then we will heal them.But if our life plan says we're supposed to experience this and then leave the planet,then we'll leave the planet in that way.In some cases the disease may be managed but not cured.We intuitively know when we're supposed to exit by a certain disease or whether it is going to be there for some time. 

For instance,an old friend of ours had various types of cancers for over 25 years before finally dying of lung cancer.She was always surviving and beating the cancer,because her incarnation was all about experiencing long term illness.Eventually,she got to the point where she had experienced it all,so she didn't need to do it any longer.The cancer was finally allowed to succeed and she died naturally and peacefully without much pain(9/2014). 

**How are mental or physical disabilities created within the templates?** 

Physical disabilities are the result of spiritual dysfunction or disharmonious thought processes that are in variance to the true function of the aspect.If we have a belief system that is damaged in some way through experience,personal thought processes or some extrapolated viewpoint,then the communication between the different templates results in a set of frequencies that are disharmonious to those associated with the gross physical form.They reprogram the gross physical,which ends up being "mutant"in terms of its cellular reproductive systems. 

The cells and other parts of the human form start to reproduce in a way that is outside of the normal spirituo-physical and genetic programming.That changes the growth pattern of the gross physical form,which relies on the information from the energetic side (through the seven templates,including the ketheric,celestial,etheric template, astral,mental,emotional and etheric body)to create the body.They are usually created by a level of misprogramming(9/2014). 

**At what point in our evolution do we consolidate the function of some ofour chakras?** 

We don't consolidate any of our chakras unless we're ascending the frequencies.I have noticed one or two individuals who are "lightworkers"of some significant effect whose frequencies are such that they are moving up the frequencies.Therefore,their bottom three chakras (base,sacral,solar)are consolidating into a single chakra, because their energies are predominantly being represented in the higher frequency rather than lower frequencies. 

When we start to function more in the fourth level (FB 4),which some of us are starting to do now,then the bottom three chakras consolidate into one "composite chakra"associated with the gross physical level (9/2014)

**What is meant by the"Tree of Life?"Does it change when our chakras change?** 

No,there is no effect on the Tree of Life with the chakras.Basically,the Tree of Life represents the downstream functions of the different event space levels that are created as a result of our decision process. 

Think of it in terms of fractalization.A tree has a main trunk,which is our main direction in our life.Then the branches coming off the trunk are the different decisions we could make to go in different directions. Then there's smaller branches and even smaller branches.These represent us diversifying in event space as a result of our choices, issues and various scenarios through which we experience,learn and evolve here. 

They all consolidate back into one trunk later,so the Tree of Life is how we would look,if we could see ourselves in terms of our entire line of existence.If you have a line going straight up,that's the trunk.Then other lines branch off to the sides,which are other parallel selves that we are experiencing simultaneously in event space. 

They keep branching off more and more until we get to an evolutionary dead end.Then that branch might collapse back into the next branch or back to the trunk again.Our Tree of Life grows its limbs its arms,its branches.Those branches disappear,as we start to go down those evolutionary dead ends and recognize them as evolutionary dead ends.But the main line trunk keeps going until we're finished (9/2014). 

**Some people ascribe the Tree of Life symbolism to our chakras,solar systems,etc.?** 

The Tree of Life symbology refers to physical vehicles or bodies that are in the first seven frequencies that need chakras.I've talked about the personal Tree of Life relative to the human vehicle.But there are Trees of Life associated with all the other entities in our galaxy,such as the Pleiadians,Arcturians,Sirians,etc.When you go beyond our galaxy to the countless millions of other galaxies in the physical universe,you get the same thing appearing,so it describes how we collectively evolve whilst incarnate(9/2014). 

**Like a Celtic Tree of Life with roots and branches merging to a fractal loop?** 

If you think of it in terms of the Celtic Tree of Life with roots and branches that branch out and then merge,you get this fractal loop. That explains it very nicely (9/2014). 

**Does the Pleiadian Tree of Life have fewer chakras than ours?** 

Again the Tree of Life symbology refers to physical vehicles or bodies that are in the first seven frequencies that need chakras.If a Pleiadian was existing in the same physical environment that we are,they would have the same number of chakras that we would have on the gross physical(FB 1-3)and spirituophysical(FB 4-7)levels. 

But if they were existing in the 4th frequency,then they would have only four chakras (FB 4-7)associated with those levels,because they wouldn't need any gross physical chakras at all. If they exist in any vehicle from the 8th frequency upwards,there won't be any chakras associated with.

If they exist in the 11th and 12th frequencies,then they won't have any chakras either,because they would have more energetic ("gaseous")bodies at those levels(9/2014). 

**What is a composite chakra?** 

Composite chakras are chakras that work on multiple frequential levels at the same time.At the moment,we have seven chakras,including the first/base chakra,second/sacral chakra,third/solar chakra, fourth/heart chakra,fifth/throat chakra,sixth/third eye chakra and seventh/crown chakra.Each of those chakras deals with a certain frequency band (from FB 1 to FB 7 as described). 

I've noticed that when some people ascend,the need to work on the higher frequencies is more important than the lower frequencies,so their first three chakras-the base,sacral and solar chakras-are combined into one bigger chakra that is assigned to the lower frequencies of the Earth. 

There is only one chakra (front/back)seen in my clairsentient and clairvoyant imagery that deals with the energies associated with the base (FB 1),sacral (FB 2)and solar (FB 3)chakras.That one composite chakra does the job of three separate chakras. 

At some stage,we might have the same thing with the 4th/heart and 5th/throat chakras that will consolidate into one chakra ("higher heart")as well.But the 6th/spiritual eye and 7th/crown chakras will stay separate,because of their higher functionality. 

Then you'll get the condition,where the human body has just four chakras-one chakra that deals with the first three frequencies(FB 1-3), one chakra that deals with the 4th and 5th frequencies (FB 4-5),the spiritual/third eye chakra(FB 6)and the crown chakra(FB 7).Therefore, a composite chakra is a chakra that deals with the frequencies of other chakras within its area(6/2015). 

**How could we have one gross physical chakra instead of three gross physical chakras?** 

That's a function of the individual working on themselves and being a higher frequency,needing a higher frequency vehicle.If we have a higher frequency vehicle,then it's not so connected into the gross physical. 

It doesn't need to have three gross physical chakras,because it doesn't have three gross physical templates,it's got one template associated with the gross physical,a composite template.It's got one chakra associated with the templates in the gross physical,which is a composite chakra.That's how we have one gross physical chakra rather than three. 

Those individuals who have lifted their frequencies up can migrate into this condition in a single lifetime,if they work on themselves. Some people are born like this.They're naturally higher frequency, because they have come to do some specific work,which is higher frequency. 

Therefore,they would have one composite gross physical chakra and one composite gross physical template and then you've got the other four spirituophysical templates and four spirituophysical chakras- chakras 4,5,6 and 7 and energy templates 4,5,6 and 7(6/2019). 

**In Autistic people the composite third chakra combines the functions of the lower chakras.Is the composite chakra less able to process or interpret the emotions or feelings of other humans who are operating with alllower chakras?** 

A composite third chakra is one where the functions of the first and second chakras are combined with the third.This is a function of rising up the frequencies.When we're in a higher frequency human form,we don't need to be so anchored in the lower frequencies associated with the gross physical.The chakras that work with the energies of the first (base),second(sacral)and third (solar)frequency levels start to become redundant. 

We get a composite chakra or a third chakra,which also works on the frequencies of the first and second chakra.It's a broader bandwidth chakra that copes with all three levels together,but it also works with the chakras in the 4th (heart),5th (throat),6th (third eye)and 7th (crown)frequencies that are the spirituo-physical levels. 

So the composite third chakra allows the incarnate vehicle to operate on the higher frequencies whilst still having an anchor point in the gross physical,but it's not as heavy an anchor point. 

People who are autistic or who have a composite third chakra rather than the first,second and third chakras will be more detached from the vagaries of incarnate individuals who are more immersed in their incarnation.They'll be experiencing a higher reality,a greater reality, so they won't be so involved with the human emotions.They won't be so involved with gossip or the need for material wealth or status. They'll be more detached from that.They won't be able to process or interpret the thoughts,behaviors and actions or the feelings or emotions of other humans who are operating on those lower levels.It's because they're higher frequency and their composite third chakra keeps them more slightly grounded(12/2017). 

**Is that part of the autistics 'problem with relating or communicating with other human beings or other beings at higher frequencies?** 

It is definitely the autistics'problem with relating or communicating with other human beings,because they are functioning on a higher level.They may seem stupid,incompetent or incapable to us,but actually they're not.They're operating on a completely different level. They're operating on a level where they are in a detached but more caring and loving environment within themselves.When they communicate with each other,they are experiencing a drastically different level of communication that standard human beings do. 

In terms of communicating with beings at higher frequencies,it's this confusion with them having to communicate with so-called normal human beings and the disharmony associated with that,which causes blockages in communicating with beings at higher frequencies. 

If they disassociated themselves totally with the standard or normal human being,they would be able to operate using their normal functionality in a completely capable way without a doubt.They would be able to communicate with other beings at higher frequencies whether they're incarnate or disincarnate(12/2017). 

**What are the reasons of feeling pain during the chakra exercise?** 

Basically,if our chakras are not functioning totally correctly or they're a bit closed down and we start to use the chakra Opening Exercises, we're pulling energy in and it's like stretching them. 

It's like stretching a muscle,which hasn't been used in a long time. We'll feel a little bit of discomfort until the chakra starts to function in a way consistent with pulling in more energy.If a chakra is lazy or if we've not been using our chakras properly,because we haven't been spiritually or energetically exercising ourselves,then we start to open it up to pulling in more energy,it will feel a bit strained. 

Some people do feel a little bit of pain as a function of opening the chakras,because their chakras are not used to operating in that way. Eventually it goes away,because the chakra gets used to it (4/2020). 

**If we practice chakra opening or repair the energetic body and auric levels every day,can we cure and prevent diseases and illnesses ourselves?Does it help us cope with pain?** 

The only limitation is ourselves-our thought processes,doubts and fears.If we are able to forget about illnesses and pains,then they go away.They no longer affect us,because we are higher frequency. 

I tend to ignore things,if I hurt myself.Even if I get a small spike of pain,it goes away,because I ignore it.I don't think I need to experience this,so it goes.I forget about it.That's the same thing with illnesses.I forget about it,I keep going.If you forget about it,you're no longer living in fear of it.If you don't live in fear of it or experiencing it,you'll maintain your higher frequency and the illness disappears,because it no longer has a function in your existence. 

This is the thing that yogis do.They don't succumb to the low frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions of being incarnate.They operate in a different level.They know that this is a temporary condition and that what they are isn't really a physical body.If they're not their physical body,they can be in control of the physical body and refuse to accept that which is physicality whilst still being physical. 

Just keep going,ignore it and it'll go away.Keep thinking of yourself as a higher frequency spiritual entity and you'll continue to move up the frequencies as well.Keep meditating and keep thinking that you're a fit and healthy person and you will be(4/2020). 

**What are the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment on the auric layers and energetic bodies?How long do these effects last?** 

Basically,things like chemotherapy is using chemicals that are detrimental to the human form with an objective of killing off cancer cells with the hope that the cancers die before the rest of the body.It creates a massive energetic disharmony,a big frequential disharmony, which is why the cancers die first,because the cancer is out of harmony with the human form.The cancer has been in enough harmony with the human form for it not to realize it's there,so it's accepted. 

The disharmony creates tears in the energetic bodies,but it also affects the way the chakras work,which changes the auric layers as well. Sometimes the auric layers have holes in them or become very thin. Sometimes they don't exist because of the dysfunction associated with the chemical(s)that shouldn't be in the body. 

It's the same thing with radiation.We talk about x-rays and radiation therapy,but we don't understand how broadband the x-rays or gamma radiation or whatever they're using are.We just see the focus of what we're trying to use,but we don't understand that these energies sometimes leak into or get close to the 4th frequency. 

They're affecting the first three frequency levels and the energy associated with the base,sacral and solar chakras.But they can also move into the energies associated with the heart chakra.The energy templates that create the human form are affected on four levels potentially,because we don't understand how broadband these radiation therapies are. 

It's very dangerous,extremely dangerous.Therapy should be an understanding of the energetics associated with the individual incarnate aspect,not using a sledge hammer to crack a sesame seed (10/2020). 

**How are we able to undo these after-effects both physically and energetically?** 

We have to be removed from the area of reception of these frequencies and energies and be surrounded by people who are higher frequency. Note that people of higher frequency might naturally try to heal us,so we will be healed as well.But there needs to be without a doubt a level of energy healing that knows where there's damage and repairs the chakras and energy templates,so it creates the healing condition within the physical form as well as energetic forms. 

When you start to work with the chakras,you work on rebuilding the chakras or replacing the chakras.You start to do the same thing,repair or replace some aspects or all aspects of the energy templates associated with the human form.Then the auric layers that are the waste products of the chakras start to become more coherent and robust as well.You can start to see these things.Basically,it's dealing with things on the energetic level and not the physical level(10/2020). 

**Once people treat their cancer,they go through regular checkups by CTs,X-rays,and/or mammography.How do they affect their health and auric or energetic bodies?** 

Well,detrimentally,because the scans do affect the energies associated with the energy templates.Arguably,the checkups are not as bad,not as detrimental to the focused energies associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy,but they don't help at all. 

They are definitely more broadband rather than being focused but with a broadband content to them.You'll find that the people going through these scans come out extremely tired and supremely lacking in energy (10/2020). 

**Please explain the link between the frequency levels and the chakras based on what Barbara Brennan wrote:** 

*"Each auric layer has its own set ofseven major chakras,each located in the same place on the physical body.For example,for the fourth chakra,there are really seven chakras,each of a higher frequency band than the lower one.These chakras appear to be nested within each other like nesting glasses."-Barbara Brennan ("Hands of Light")*

**Are the chakras nested like nesting glasses?What happens when we move up the frequencies from the third level to the fourth level?**

I've looked at this question and I was really quite interested in it, because what I see isn't what Barbara has described in The Hands of Light.I feel I understand the reason why. 

Each chakra predominantly represents an energy template and those energy templates operate on a certain frequency level.For instance,we have the root chakra operating on the first frequency level.We have the sacral chakra on the second frequency level,the solar chakra on the third,etc.,and the crown chakra operating on the seventh level. 

As a healer,if you're looking at the person and you look at them "panfrequentially,"which means you're looking at them from outside of their form and you're seeing all the frequenciestogether,you see a set of chakras and you see the energy templates nested together,almost creating one. 

But when you only focus on one particular freqguency level,you see the energy template associated with that frequency level-let's say,the fourth frequency level and you see the heart chakra associated with that.That chakra deals with energies and frequencies associated with that level and feeds the energy template associated with that level.It can't feed the other templates.It doesn't work that way. 

What I feel has happened is Barbara is seeing things in a panfrequential state-seeing the templates all sort of nested together.She thought that because she's seeing the chakras all in one go (which is what you would do),she feels that she's seeing a bunch of nested chakras as well.But my understanding is that it doesn't work that way. 

I also understand that sometimes people relate to the "auric layers"as well.But the auric layers in my understanding are a waste product.For instance,when we turn a light bulb on,we get light,because that's what we want a light bulb to do.But the waste product is heat and magnetic radiation.If you have a special camera that is able to register magnetic radiation,you would see magnetic waves around the coil of the bulb as well.In the bulb's case,you've got the waste product in two ways:magnetic radiation and heat plus light,which is what we're trying to create. 

In terms of the auric layers,the auric layers are a waste product. They're like the "heat"or the magnetic radiation associated with it,so to speak.It's really not that,but it's a good example.The gross physical (FB 1-3)and the spirituo-physical (FB 4-7)aspects of the human form create the body in totality. 

The vehicle we incarnate into is created through seven layers.Each of those seven layers need to be fed energy independently but collectively together to work.Each of those layers has a chakra associated with them.By the way,I'm discounting the energetic functions above the vehicle at FB 8-10,which are a "step down function"that allow the soul's sentient energies to be funneled into the human vehicle. 

When we're looking at things panfrequentially,we see that the energy templates are nested together,but the chakras appear all as one group of chakras.I feel that maybe Barbara was seeing things slightly in error or interpreted things in a different way to what I see,because I see it quite clearly.As I see it,when the energy comes in through a particular chakra,it energizes the function of that energy template,which is a component part of the incarnate human vehicle,which has seven component parts.

But the function of allowing the body to work and be animated by the soul creates waste.It's a"lossy"function to be incarnate,which means that you use energy and you waste energy.Just like we imbibe drink and eat food that we metabolize.It sustains the gross physical aspect of our body,but waste comes out in feces and urine.

Similarly,in a motor car we put in petrol or diesel,we drive the car and it goes forwards.We get carbon emissions and water particulates out of the exhaust pipe and heat in the engine.That's a waste product.When the chakras are working,they're feeding these energy templates and creating a waste product-an electromagnetic energy field that's associated with that particular frequency level.Each of the auric layers is a waste product associated with the function of the chakra feeding the energy template of the human vehicle.That's what I see there. 

It's the energy templates that are nested together as one-not the chakras.It's only when you look at the human form in a panfrequential way that you see all of those energy templates nested together and you see one set of chakras.Whereas if you isolate a frequency and look at just one energy template,let's say,the throat at the fifth frequency level,you see the energy template at the fifth frequency and you only see fifth chakra(front and rear aspects),which is the throat chakra. 

When I look at this,I understand it.I think Barbara understood it,but she couldn't quite grasp the concept so early.Even in her diagrams in her books,you can see the energy templates in a representation and then separately there's the auric layers as well.You can start to understand that this "nesting"is maybe just a misunderstanding (12/2020). 

**What is the "relative frequency"of an etheric body?Is it graduated and measurable?** 

The relative frequency of an etheric body is always the first frequency (FB 1).The mental body is always the frequency of the mental body(FB 3).These are the names of the energy templates,not the names of the auric layers,which is something else. 

The whole point of this is that we have teachers like Barbara to get us to a certain level.Then if the teacher has been good,we can rise above that teacher.Then those teachers teach others and if they're good,they get their students above them as well. 

Each of these chakras have little subvortices or smaller cones within them that deal with the subfreguencies as well.The tolerance associated with the particular frequency level is dealt with by the vortices within the chakra itself.Each of them deals with the frequency slightly above them or slightly below them,so to speak. 

You don't get any overlap in terms of the way the chakras work frequentially,because they always separate out at some point and become one chakra rather than a combination of one,two or three chakras (12/2020). 

**What foods best serve the heart chakra?Any specific fruits, vegetables or herbs?** 

There are some physical things that give good energies associated with the gross physical that actually can percolate over to some of the frequencies that are associated with the chakras. 

Not many,but I'm told peppers are good,the large apple shaped bell peppers.I'm also told that jalapenos are good.Be careful how you eat these things,because they can be quite warm.Apples are good and some edible plants,such as spinach (good for iron)and cabbage as well. Notice these things are raw,not cooked.Keep them raw,so that will help. 

This is coming from Source,by the way,channeled information rather than looking at a book.Don't forget the chakras aren't physical as such. They're not gross physical anyway,they're energetic,so the frequencies that they work with are their "best food." 

The fourth frequency is best for the heart chakra.The third frequency is best for the solar chakra.The second frequency is best for the sacral chakra,etc.,down to the root and up towards the crown chakra.So the frequencies and the energies associated with the frequency that they're designed to work with is the best for them(1/2021). 

**What are the best fruits,vegetables or herbs to serve chakras 1 to 7? Do physical foods serve the chakras less efficiently than chakra opening exercises or deep meditation?** 

Basically,the chakras are nothing to do with the gross physical other than the fact that they support the energetic templates that create the body,the human body.The first three chakras are associated with the gross physical body. 

In terms of fruits and vegetables that are beneficial to the body, anything that's grown in the ground is beneficial.Root vegetables are particularly good,because their energies are very,very good.Nuts are also good.You can live on vegetables,herbs and fruits in general. 

All of these things are best eaten raw.But if you want to cook them, cook them so they'll still have got a slight crunchiness,a bit "al dente." You can still feel them as you eat them.Don't cook them too much, because then you'll lose the energy associated with them.That's why I say it's best to eat them raw (e.g.raw broccoli,cauliflower,carrots, parsnips).It's very good for things like cancer as well. 

Everything is delicious raw.It's just that we've gotten used to cooking things.When we cook things,the energy goes out of them.But physical foods don't actually serve the chakras at all.The chakras create the potential for the gross physical.They don't need the gross physical to sustain them.All they need is the energies and frequencies associated with what they're predominantly designed to work with,so physical food isn't necessary for the chakras-absolutely not. 

The best thing you can do is the Chakra Opening Exercises,which are very good,because we start to work with our chakras and understand their needs in terms of making sure they're open,knowing how a chakra feels when it's functioning and when it's dysfunctional,when it's blocked and cleaning your chakras yourself or get somebody else,a healer,who you know and trust to do the work for you. 

Gross physical food doesn't matter for the chakras,although chakra opening exercises and other exercises to do with connecting with the chakras is good(2/2021).

### Channeling 

Channeling is a higher function than meditation.There are many types of channels with different levels ofabilities to connect with various entities at various levels and to receive and translate the information given through clairvoyance,clairaudience,clairsentience,claircognizance,etc. 

**Is channeling the Pleiadians,Arcturians or Sirians authentic or a hoax?** 

Channeling is something usually attributed to communicating with discarnate entities (e.g.Higher Self,Source,Origin).But the term is sometimes used incorrectly for communication with entities that are incarnate the same as us,but on a different frequency level within the physical universe.Some of them are slightly higher than us and some are very high,probably at FB 5 or FB 6 compared to where we are now (FB1-3). 

We could potentially classify it as being energetic,because those incarnate entities in the FB 5,FB 6 and FB 7 frequency levels would need to be "channeled."They would communicate telepathically with people,because they wouldn't be able to communicate in any other way.They could do that via pure energetic connectivity or by a technology-based link. 

The name of the group is immaterial,it's the frequential state they're at.Some of them are more advanced,so they understand more about the greater reality than we do in human form.When they are incarnate,they don't lose as much of their connectivity and state of beingness as we do,so they stay more aware and awake than us. 

When an individual is "channeling"these entities,there is a level of communication going onon a telepathic level,but there's quite a bit of overlay of the person's individual preferences in doing the channeling and receiving the telepathic communications.It is authentic,but it is being filtered through a bit of personal preference.That's one way of saying it (6/2016). 

**There seems to be an explosion of channeling.What do you see going on with the energies/frequencies because of it?Can people send curses to others,negative entities,etc.?** 

Yes,people can send not so much curses,but thought-forms which are negative and which are created through the misuse of spiritual functions.They tend to use the lower frequencies associated with the lower astral levels which are 4th and 5th level.The curses are just energy that's used to create a disharmonious condition to affect those individuals in a physical way that creates disease,virus or poor outcomes for things. 

The thing with channeling is sometimes it's fake.Sometimes it's communicating with the wrong entities-with energetic entities or incarnate entities at slightly higher frequency.Sometimes it's communicating simply with yourself. 

If the channeling is pure and the channel is pure,then it's going to be good.It will mean that the overall energies,the frequencies associated with those individuals that are channeling will affect others in a positive way.If the channeling is used in a selfish way for self status or gain,then it's not going to have the same energy or frequential space associated with it. 

We have to be very careful with this.When you see a channeler and their content,question it.Question it with your own intuition.Does this feel right for me?Does it feel right for how I see it in totality?Or is it some idle thought processes or someone being manipulated as a result of somebody wanting to put their own point of view forwards and using the word"channeling"to justify or augment the importance surrounding it(2/2018)? 

**In The History of God you met Byron,the dragon entity.He tried to frighten you away,but it didn't work.You told him you thought all entities at level 27 were supposed to be "good."He said we are- mostly.What does he mean?What is a"non-good"entity?** 

It's about understanding that some of these entities aren't so willing to interact with other entities that are incarnate or at a lower frequency, because they see the possibility of misunderstanding and misdirection through interacting with them.It's about their friendliness in terms of being in contact or interacting with us.Some of them have a bit of fun with us.They may give us information,which is by and large true,but can be slightly off the center line as well. 

The "non-good"entities are still early on in their evolutionary level.If their True Energetic Self is at level 27,they're still quite selfish in what they are doing.They still haven't understood the concept of working for the good of everybody.They could ignore us or play with us for their own entertainment.If they naturally reside at level 27,then they're not evolved to the point of being able to probably be incarnate as yet.That's something else to think about(7/2019). 

**The Source says it uses level 60"as a buffer."Why does God need a buffer?** 

If you think about the Traversing The Frequencies work,when we get to the 100th frequency,that's when it starts to become interesting to us as incarnate entities in terms of how we commune and work with it.It's to do with allowing Source to function and not get distracted with the work that its smaller individualized units of itself are working with. 

Source uses that as a "firewall"to make a buffer,so that it can do its work and allow the other entities to do their work without disturbing them too much.Why would God not want to be disturbed by those smaller individualized units of itself?It's just a function of what it wants to do.It's allowing itself to concentrate on its own stuff. 

When an aspect in its incarnate state is able to commune with Source or God from any real level,it mostly ends up in the 100th level (or 89th universe),then it tends to pay more attention,because the usefulness or the evolutionary gain and progression through being in contact with Source at that level and being here at the same time is more significant than if it was at another level. 

It's almost like sending out a part of yourself and then it finds its way back to Source.But where it's been sent to is a maze where it's deaf, dumb and blind.Whatever you've learned from being deaf,dumb and blind and finding the center of the maze and coming back to it,that's when Source/God starts to pay attention to us,because we've got more to offer it(7/2019).

**In The CuratorsI was put off by the tone and words of Source who was being very "snippy"calling you "Mr.Om"and giving you a such hard time("By now you should have worked out...")that you finally said, "Give me some latitude here please."SE1 apologized.** 

Yeah,well,sometimes I suppose it's frustration that I sometimes ask the same question two or three times and that's because I want to make sure I understand it (11/2019). 

**What was the point ofthat exchange?Was it to show us all that even SE1 has to apologize sometimes-in this case for being so critical of your line of questioning?Really?Even after you've written six highly expansive books already?** 

Well,it's really a case of sometimes any entity will have a level of understanding and a level of frustration irrespective of frequency.But sometimes it needs to be broadcast in a way,which is understandable on a lower frequency.Source Entity One in that condition was telling me to just realize how much I know and not overly question what I know.Sometimes as an engineer,we try to sort of analyze and understand things-and a scientist would understand this-right down to the point of being absolutely 130%certain that what we're experiencing is right. 

I do tend to do that,so it's saying,"You know this-why do you need to ask the question again?"It's a bit like riding a push bike and then asking your parents,"Can I ride this push bike?"They look at you strange and say,"Well,you've just done a marathon.You've just ridden a hundred miles.Of course,you can ride a push bike."It's a little bit like that,so it's giving me a bit of a kick or a nudge to say that you don't need to ask questions like this,because you understand it.It was moving me out of a certain level of an uncertain thinking process.That was the reason (11/2019). 

**That didn't sound like a Source Entity level exchange.The same snippy Source Entity reared its head in The History of God a couple times,which made me wonder who you were channeling at the time? Please explain it from your point of view.** 

Sometimes the Source Entity has to-we all have to-change the way in which we work with people to make sure we work on their level.If you try to engage with somebody who hasn't got a degree in astrophysics in a way that only somebody who's got a PhD in astrophysics would understand,trying to converse in that way doesn't work.We have to change the way in which we and the Source Entity and the Origin communicate to a way which is understandable by us or acceptable by us. 

Sometimes giving us a nudge in the right direction has to be done,not in an aggressive way,but to say,"Come on,wake up!You understand this."It's a bit like taking me out of my own reveries or sometimes slightly downward spiral where I'm not going into disbelief in what I'm picking up,but I'm questioning it to the point where I need to move out of that spiral and go back up again.That's the reason for it really. 

It's the Source dealing with me in ways in which it has to,because I'm being a human being at the moment.Don't forget right now we're going through a lower frequency situation,so even I am affected by the low frequencies.Sometimes these lower frequencies do have an effect on the way we think,behave and act.That's the reason for that. 

It's a good question that needed to be answered.Don't worry about me being told off.Sometimes we need a push.At the end of the day,we have to understand that we're being helped.Sometimes we have to have a good kick up the back side to make sure that we're moving in some direction.As Barbara Brennan once said,sometimes a heart attack for men is a good way of making us change direction.Sometimes an illness is a way of changing us.We would consider that to be a very difficult or a very direct and probably not desirable way of being moved from one way to another way.That's how you have to think of these things sometimes(11/2019). 

**In a recent Satsanga,you cautioned us about entities that "have some fun with you."What do you mean?Why do they do that?How can we distinguish and avoid such entities?** 

I was talking about entities.If people are overly enthusiastic about connecting with other entities to the point of indiscretion,then astral entities can come in to communicate with us.They try to persuade us that we are talking with an entity that is disincarnate but within the evolutionary cycle.Or we can find other entities which are incarnate but higher frequency that want to talk to us. 

We have to be very careful in how we receive things.My response is to be guarded in how you receive information and how you broadcast your desire to communicate with other entities. 

I've known a number of individuals over the years who have desired to be in communication with other entities,whether they are higher frequency incarnate entities or energetic entities to the point where they don't care about where it comes from.They don't check where it comes from or they are just so open that anything and anybody can come through. 

What happens is they can be controlled and coerced and manipulated. This is quite sad,because they may have a poor spiritual experience. Then they have a lot of difficulty in understanding whether they can actually receive information again and trust it and trust themselves. 

What we have to look for is:Are we being buttered up?Are they just giving us answers to the questions we want?Are they working with our desires and giving us what we want?Or what we feel we want rather than information which is not specifically what we want but is true? Are they using sentences,which we wouldn't do ourselves? 

That is a way of discerning that you are not talking to yourself because we're all good at that.If you can look at the way the sentences are constructed and the words used,then you can realize that some of these sentences and the words aren't something that you would do. Then you start to realize that in essence,it is another entity. 

Then you have to find out whether they're just coercing you by telling you what you know or what you want to know rather than what you don't want to know.It's very difficult.You have to protect yourself first.You can use a psychic shield of any form as long as you know it's going to work.Or you can create the Psychic Shield I've got on the internet and program it.You should knowit's going to work rather than believe it's going to work.Or just simply ask questions that would potentially trip up this entity.If it's real and sincere,you'll know.It's a bit like asking psychological questions to find out your IQ.

You can ask the same questions in a number of different ways,in ways that aren't traceable or linked together.If you get the same answers, then you know the entity you're working with is bona fide and okay to work with.But always protect yourself.Always keep your own counsel. Always maintain your energy.Don't give yourself away to anything and anyone.That's most important (11/2019). 

**I speak to our SE and the "Big Oh"regularly andIknow that they hear me.I want to communicate with other Source Entities,including SE13.Am I just deceiving myself by imagining I can share thoughts with them?Are they aware ofmy gratitude to them?** 

Reading the books can be a focus-an energetic focus-so they can give you a link and energetic downloads.We're all smaller,individualized units of our True Energetic Self and our TESs are smaller individualized units of Source and Source is a smaller,individualized unit of the Origin.Therefore,we're all the same thing. 

To be concerned about whether or not one is communicating with a higher part of oneself or a higher level of sentience is probably the ego coming in and trying to keep you down in terms of the lower frequencies. 

Be discerning definitely,that's the right thing to do.But know that you are communicating with these entities,because they are simply higher functions of what we are,because we're part of them.Sometimes the books act as a focus and an energy download as well.I know a number of individuals have experienced this.It's wonderful for them to have experienced various different downloads and I'm really pleased when they do(11/2019). 

**I was reading a book from Nepal where I am from,which was directly relatable in religious and cultural terms to the people of Nepal.Is the knowledge specific to the place where it's given?Does a channeler's information depend upon who it's being channeled for?** 

It can be sometimes,but we have to move beyond that and look at it from a more global sense.If we start to think of its relevance to the individual,then it becomes very narrow and limited in its depth,so it's possible. 

Anybody who is channeling and doing the work,we need to move ourselves out of our location and think in terms of what's happened across the world or across the universe rather than on our continent. But it's also possible that it is there to help certain small groups rather than large groups of individuals.If that's the objective of the author, then that's fine. 

But they need to state that this is to help individuals of Nepalese or Asian heritage to understand more about where their spirituality comes from and how it was derived.State that rather than say that it's global,because that can be confusing(2/2020). 

**In Kevin Moore's interviews ("We Are Channelers),how many ofthe channels are truly channeling the groups they claim(e.g.archangels, ETs,etc.)rather than astral entities?What percent of them are legitimate?Some ofit doesn't sound truthful or helpful.** 

What Kevin is doing is giving us a broad brushstroke of those individuals who are suggesting that they are a channeler or a psychic or a medium or whatever you want to call yourself.He's giving the broad brushstroke of those who are good and those who aren't so good. It's giving you the chance to realize there are those who are good at what they do and those who are just starting out.There are others who are controlled by the ego,so they think they're doing it,but they aren't. 

We need to use it as a learning opportunity rather than saying it's a good program or a bad program.Kevin is showing the total diversity of individuals and their abilities within the genre of service to incarnate mankind.Think of it that way.When you see those who take advantage of people,because they call themselves something,then you know how to avoid them.If you see somebody who is really good and can prove that they're good at what they're doing and not consumed by the ego, then you've seen the other side,the true and strong individuals. 

Use your intuition.It's all about giving you the benefit of seeing those who are good vs.those who are not so good,those who are lying to themselves vs.those who are lying to the public,those who are being of service to the public vs.those who are being of service to themselves and those who are just jumping on the bandwagon and creating it. 

You're being given the total spectrum of what's out there.You're starting to realize that some of it is not as good as it's supposed to be. Use your intuition to work out which individuals are charlatans vs.the real thing.Kevin is trying to show the whole spectrum to allow you to make up your own mind based upon your own intuition and your own experience in the past(2/2020). 

**In The Curators you said to the Source Entity,"When we talk in private..."Compared to your public conversations with SE,are your private discussions brief episodes?** 

It just depends.They can be in depth or they can be momentary. Sometimes they're momentary when huge concepts are given to me-a concept or idea or knowledge.It can take me quite a long time to understand it in some detail before I broadcast it to the general public. Sometimes it's brief but yields a lot of information.Sometimes it's a long time and yields a small amount of information.It depends upon the information and my state of connectivity-how interested I am, what I'm doing at the time,whether I can sit down and create the type of link required to support the information that's coming.Usually this information comes in random ways. 

When I'm writing the books,I'm focused on writing the books.I'm focused on going in the direction I'm being told to go in to support the subjects in the chapters I'm writing.But there are things that happen just randomly,like when I'm walking or maybe cycling or meditating or sitting in a chair watching television.I don't watch television much, but it's one of these things where things suddenly come to you. 

Sometimes they come to me when there's no blockages,no resistance- the door's open and in it comes.Then I'll go,"Oh,that makes sense."I'll remember that and write it down.Sometimes it comes into a book and sometimes it doesn't(1/2021).

### Climate Change 

**Is manmade global warming or climate change a myth?** 

Global warming in terms of manmade pollution is not strictly true, because there are bigger systems at play,such as the natural cycle of weather systems,ice ages,pole shifts and things.We add to it,because we pollute the Earth in many ways,but not in the way the politicians tell us. It's a vast misunderstanding,because it's a combination of larger weather systems and our own pollution from using fossil fuels and radiation for generating fuel,using highly polluting manufacturing processes and natural pollutants,like methane from vegetation rotting,animal metabolic systems and overpopulation of humanity that damage the Earth. This will continue until we start to use more eco-friendly processes within the next 100 years or so.We will move strictly away from polluting methods of manufacturing and generating energy,because we'll have access to other technologies that will be given to us through individuals supposedly "inventing"them. They will be getting channeled information given to them,such as discovering methods to use free energy (prana),which is part of the multiverse and Source.There are also individuals that are providing generators that can create energy in a lossless way,because the energy is out there(3/2014). How close is the pole shift to us?How will it affect us? We're in an area of 500 years where this thing is going to happen.We're experiencing certain minor changes of pole shifting already.A couple of years ago I detected that we have moved about 5-6 degrees away from the previous location of the poles.There is always an offset in the geometric north vs.magnetic north. This is happening as we speak,so it can flip at any moment within these 500 years depending on what's happening around us and where we are located.I'm picking up that it may be within or after our lifetime. In terms of how it affects us,clearly,our navigational systems (e.g. airplanes,boats,spacecraft)are going to take a big hit,so they will have to be changed,because they are based on the magnetic north.As a result,we may have changes in our ability to navigate.Birds,like pigeons will also struggle with navigation. The bigger issue for us is how it will affect the geology and weather systems.We can quickly change our technology to cope with different positions of the magnetic north when it becomes the magnetic south. But it's the weather systems that will give us the major changes.We will be able to cope with it,but we'll have changes that are so profound that we'll have whole cities devastated. We've already experienced that in some places,like Christchurch,NZ with a big earthquake.They've had to rebuild the city.We've had tsunamis in Japan as well.It will also get warmer as our frequencies change.When we increase our frequency,we get lighter and we'll have less ice at the poles,so it will get warmer.We'll get changes in the jet stream as well with more temperate conditions in certain areas and more rain in other areas(3/2014).

Do pole shifts in the fossil records correlate with mass extinctions? That is correct for animals or incarnate vehicles that don't have the ability to cope with the changes.As a so-called "intelligent race,"we should be able to cope with it,but we'll have a hard time with it.If it ends up being more like 500 years in the future,our technology will be more robust.We'll be able to cope with it better,because we'll see it coming.Maybe our cities won't be on the surface. Basically,pole shifts along with viral pandemics are a way of reducing the population of Earth,so the Earth can cope with the demand of the incarnate population on it.It's sometimes useful to allow the Earth to regenerate.Some of these things are there to allow the Earth to regenerate,so that we can make better use of it later. At some point,we're not going to use fossil fuels any longer,because that's depleting the Earth.That causes a problem,as does getting gas with the fracking technology.When we start getting methodologies, which start using free energy for instance,we won't need to have the same type of energies and abuse the Earth in the way we are.Then the pollution won't be nearly the same and all of these things will allow the Earth to rise in frequencies(3/2014). Will crystals be used? Crystals are already being used in technology right now,such as quartz crystals in clocks and microprocessors in our computers.Crystal-based technologies were used by the Atlanteans and we're already using them for healing as well. The reduction in the population of mankind is also concurrent with the number of individuals that have already ascended.Those that need to stay here,because they haven't reached a certain frequency level will stay here.Everybody else will have ascended out of the way,so they'll be out of the cycle of incarnation.Or their bodies will be higher frequency,so they won't be affected in the same way as those in the lower frequency with the different weather system and geological changes(3/2014). Is Climate Change caused by man or a result of natural weather cycles?What is the true agenda ofthe climate change movement?Is it to advance a political/economic agenda? Basically,climate change is a function of a couple of different things. Clearly,human beings have an effect on the environment and we need to clean our act up.It's very important for us to do that. The pollution destroys animals and environments.It makes rivers, pools or lakes poisonous.It destroys the environment and the atmosphere,so that trees and plants can't breathe properly and convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen in an efficient way. We have an effect without a doubt and we have an effect in all sorts of different ways.We don't just pollute the atmosphere with hydrocarbons or the exhausts of airplanes,motor cars or other things, we pollute it in terms of radiation,such as radio waves. Everything we do or create can be classified as a form of pollution because of the byproducts.Even our trash pollutes the Earth,because we just dig up a big hole and put it in the hole.We are affecting the environment in a dramatic way,but it's something that we can work on. There is an effect on climate as a result of the pollution that mankind creates and the ozone layers are an example of that.We need to work on better ways of recycling and converting our vision to reusable energy. We need to work on how we move around the planet and what manufacturing techniques we use,because everything creates some form of pollution. On top of this,there is a bigger weather system associated with the Earth than we give credit for.A lot of the things we experience are a natural function of a large global weather system,which is affected by the magnetic poles of the Earth.If we have a pole change,that affects the way that the molecules or the atoms in the air and in the water and everything else interact with each other.A start of the pole change starts to affect the weather,the climate and things like the jet streams change direction as well.The big weather system is misunderstood totally. There's a bigger weather system where every ten years or so the weather system changed for a year,reversed itself for a year and then went back to what it was normally.But that ten year cycle is just a small weather system that has weather systems within it.What we have is huge weather systems and weather systems within those. The big levels of climate change that we're experiencing is a function of not just pollution,but bigger natural weather cycles and weather cycles within weather cycles.We've gone from global cooling to global warming and it might change to something else,like global tropical, for instance.It's just a big natural weather system with cycles within cycles. In a science documentary in the UK,they were taking ice cores to see the evidence of how weather had changed.For thousands of years the weather systems were the same and then things start to change.Things were changing within a hundred years and then within 20 years.They said that things can change really quickly or take a long time to change depending upon where the cycle is. There are weather systems within weather systems and cycles within cycles within bigger cycles.We can change drastically from one weather system to another really quickly in 20 and 50 years,for instance.We talk about global warming or global cooling,but actually we are currently in a Mini Ice Age.If we go into a warmer Earth,it's a natural function of a bigger weather cycle.It's not climate change caused by man alone,although mankind has some contribution towards it. The cleaner we get-not burning fossil fuels or creating electromagnetic and other radiation,but working on cleaner energies and cleaner manufacturing techniques-the less we will pollute the Earth and affect the environment as well. Governments and people like to use these things for political justification of their own agendas.If it can be used to control people,it will be.If it can be used to justify the actions of a cause,it will be. At some point,China,Taiwan and India will start to get their act together and work in a cleaner and more pollution free environment as well-not because they want to but because they'll have to.They won't be able to continue otherwise,because they'll create so much pollution that they can't survive.Survival comes first,therefore,reduction in pollution will come as a result of that(12/2017) The United Nations reported that this is the warmest period in the history of modern civilization.Climate change is seen as record- breaking droughts,wildfires,floods,hurricanes,extreme heat waves and poverty across the globe.Is this what our future holds? My understanding is that we are currently in a Mini Ice Age,so global warming is a natural function of a larger weather cycle.On top of that there is influence by mankind.There is also influence as a result of animals,the movement and functions of animals and the functions of man.There's going to be changes We've got a pole shift,which is in progress right now.It is causing magnetic problems and anomalies.It's also causing issues with the jet stream,so we are going to get warmer anyway naturally.We haven't got to the tropical stage of our cycle yet,because that's some time in the future and beyond my incarnate lifetime. Mankind does have a significant part to play,but what we're doing isn't causing the big problems that are happening with the jet stream.It's simply a function of the big weather cycles as a result of the location of the Earth around the Sun and the Sun's location within the galaxy,the rotation of the galaxy,etc.It's a whole bunch of different things coming into play here.We will go into another Big Ice Age eventually. But that's thousands of years into the future(10/2018). Is this what our future holds? In the next 10-20 years,we won't experience a complete pole shift.The Earth has moved slightly on its axis as well,but the pole shift is happening and when it happens,it will be quite dramatic.We're going to have some quite devastating weather.We'll survive it and we'll have to rebuild some certain things,but we're going to be challenged.It will mean that flying and traversing the waters will be more difficult.At times,more hurricanes,more typhoons,more turbulent air,those sorts of things.We'll start to get those more and more in the next 10-35 years. But I'm being told that we're going to go to a more temperate condition overall.Although we're going to have more vicious weather,we're going to eventually come out the other side where we have a more moderate and temperate atmosphere.We won't get the same variations in winter and summer that we're currently getting.For instance,the UK has had very temperate winters for a long time,but that will be seen across the globe.Eventually,we will come out the other side. We'll start to go back into more profound winters and more profound summers as a function of the location of the Earth.We're going to basically see more and more weather.The jet stream will change again in its location,so the profile will get deeper.The dips in the jet stream will be deeper dips.That will cause changes in places-where they were warm before,they will become more moderate.Where they were more moderate,they will become warmer.Where they were colder,they might warm up as well(10/2018). Are there new geo-engineering technologies? Certainly in the next 35 years,we're going to start to see some more glacial movement and more melting of the polar ice caps,but not massive,just very small stuff.It will be measurable by scientists.In some ways,global warming will help us move forwards to cleaner technologies.There still won't be any agreement as to whether this is a natural thing or a manmade thing.They'll assume manmade,which is fine,if it helps to clean our act up.We need to look after the Earth as it is.There will be a greater understanding of the bigger weather system. But this is only going to be available to us when this current civilization has another couple of thousand years under its belt without going into a downward trend where we lose knowledge,like the Atlanteans did.If we can survive for another two thousand years and keep control of our technologies,progress frequentially and look after the Earth,we'll start to see the real records that show some of the bigger weather patterns. We'll start to understand how this is a function of the Earth-its location in orbit,its angle of axis and the magnetic poles and how they work.We will also look at how we affect it properly,because we'll have more data and better ways of understanding,monitoring it and collecting and analyzing information as well (10/2018). What is the best way to inject energies to Earth?Is it better to allow the Earth decide?I have noticed that the Earth has difficulty absorbing some energies? Sometimes we need to let the Earth absorb energies in the way it can absorb them.A stone won't absorb water like a sponge will.A stone will eventually absorb the water,but not at the same speed as the sponge. We have to let things happen in the way it's supposed to happen. Ask the Earth what it wants to have and then provide yourself as the portal for that work to happen.Ask the Earth what energies it needs or wants to have?Then say,"Okay,work through me,Earth."The energies will come your way.Rather than trying to push it into the Earth or inject it into the Earth,allow the Earth to suck the energies through you where you are an interface,not the provider of the energies (4/2020) What is the best thing we can do for the Earth from the Earth's perspective? Think of Earth as being yourself and look after it as you would look after yourself.That's the best way to think of it.Everything you do for yourself,you do for the Earth-everything you do for the Earth,you do for yourself.Look after yourself,look after the Earth.Don't do anything to the Earth that you wouldn't do to yourself.Simple as that.That's the way to be a good citizen.Be an ecologically wonderful individual-look after yourself,look after your planet and your environment and enjoy doing it(4/2020). Fragrance pollution is becoming a serious issue in Japan.People are using toxic products without knowing it-causing illness to those using them and those around them.Is there a way to persuade people to stop using these products without offending them? People have been programmed into thinking that the natural smell of the body is abusive.All we need to do is make sure that areas with active sweat glands are cleaned on a daily basis and we can use very natural products.If we're clean,we don't need any of these offensive products at all.For example,there's lots of different products available in the environment that we can use to clean ourselves,like sponges in the sea,swimming in the sea with salty water that exfoliates us. How to persuade people?When people are addicted to being in the material world to think I am a better person,because I smell like this and can afford this product,it's difficult.But if the process of creating these fragrances isn't eco-friendly,that's a problem affecting the Earth. If the smells are affecting people who are too sensitive,that's pollution. We just need to reprogram people,probably from an early age to be clean and use natural products.For instance,there are locations around the world where people don't have toothbrushes.They chew on a certain wood stick that sterilizes and neutralizes the bacteria in the mouth.It also removes plaque. We need to train ourselves to recognize that beauty is the soul,not the body.The body is simply a motor car or a vehicle we're using to be able to experience,learn and evolve in this low frequency environment. Addiction to products that make us look good or feel good is karmic (9/2020). Is the Psychic Shield effective to protect ourselves from pollution?If we can protect ourselves from viruses using the shield,can we protect ourselves from chemicals? Yes,but it's not a case of believing it,it is knowingit.You can program the Psychic Shield to create a condition where your frequency is naturally higher and in a place where things that would affect us chemically won't affect us,because our frequency puts our structure to a level where it's a higher frequency. Let's think of it in terms ofice.If we think of our human body as ice,the water molecules are packed together,because they've got no energy. When we raise the frequencies by heating it,the ice melts and becomes water.The molecules are further apart or less dense,because the heat breaks down the structure from being in stasis to being fluid.If we give it even more frequency,the water becomes steam or air,because it's got more frequency,more energy and the molecules are even further apart.If you give it even more energy,the steam becomes even more diffuse. If you think of the gaps in between the molecules as being a function of frequency,the lower the frequency,the smaller the gaps,therefore, chemicals can attach themselves to the structure,because they can't get through.If you have higher frequency or massive gaps,chemicals can't stick to them,because there's mostly space and no particles or structure there.That's the way to think about it. Creating the Psychic Shield is the best way to do it.You can program the shield to make you higher frequency,so you don't get attached to chemicals and they can't stick to your physical body,because you're too high a frequency.It goes through the gaps(9/2020).

### Conspiracy Theories 

How can we avoid getting entangled in conspiracy or other forms of gossip? When we're given information about anything,whether it's a spiritual or a material event,we're only getting one part of the jigsaw puzzle based on what one individual is presenting and broadcasting.We need to separate the spiritual wheat from the chaff by taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture.Then we'll start to see that people are only presenting the aspect that is relevant to their level of understanding the truth. By stripping out the personalized aspect of what is being broadcast,we see the truth within it and separate it from misinformation,which is meant to control the masses by misleading them or presenting another reality to them.There is constant chatter in the background through the mass media or those that govern us.Whether they talk about conspiracy theory or gossip,they affect us in the same way.They shift the karmic link from an individual to groups of individuals,so they get involved in mass karma. If we're not careful,we can get linked to three-fold karma related to self-karma and mass karma.It can take many incarnations to disassociate ourselves from links with those individuals that we've conspired with and those individuals we've conspired against.If we have an opportunity to discuss conspiracy,we should just walk away, because it's another form of karma,which attaches us to lower frequency thoughts,behaviors or actions.Our participation just augments the event spaces of the conspiracists that gain more gravity and pull other people into it. All we really need to do is work on ourselves,be of service to those who need it and interface minimally with the media,family,friends or colleagues who engage in gossip or conspiracy.To free ourselves from the dueling forces or conflict,we need to give ourselves permission not to get involved in it and enter a different event space.It's a simple decision where we choose not to be drawn into it,because it's not our reality.We can work together for the greater good rather than gossip or conspiracy (3/2013). How do chemtrails affect us? There's a lot of misinformation about chemtrails and planes.Most of what we see in the sky aren't chemical trails by airplanes.When we see an airplane go by and we see a white trail behind it,it is compressed air or localized compression of the air created by the airplane squashing the air on its way forwards.This creates localized turbulence and localized clouds. But if chemicals were to be administered to us by planes at the heights that we see them,we would never see the chemicals come down, because they would be totally invisible to us.They would dissolve and disperse in such a way that we wouldn't see them and we wouldn't notice they were there.At that height,they probably wouldn't make any difference to us anyway.It would need to be low enough-about the same height or just above the same height as a crop duster-to affect us.When planes dump fuel at a low altitude,that's a problem, because it does affect us(1/2015). How can we overcome the mind control and DNA manipulation ofthe matrix? Simply put,we would need to effectively own our energy.We own our energy anyway,but we need to ensure that we own it rather than letting it just exist.It's a little bit like cooking a meal and just putting the meal in the oven to cook it.If we don't keep our eye on the meal,the meal gets burned.If we're constantly watching the meal,watching how it cooks,then we're owning it.If we just put it in the oven and say, "Okay,I'll just let it cook and come back in 2 hours time"expecting it to be perfect,we come back and it's burned to a crisp,then we haven't owned it. This is the same with us.If we don't own ourselves,if we allow ourselves to be on automatic,then we become the human being,don't we?We no longer start to question our environment or work with higher frequential thought processes or states of beingness or thoughts,behaviors or actions. It's only when we start to own ourselves and own those thoughts, behaviors and actions that we start to better ourselves.Then we control ourselves,it's not somebody else controlling us.If we own ourselves, we would not be able to be controlled by anybody-not by advertisements,subliminal messages or gossip.The Buddhists have a word for it,it's mindfulness.It's being mindful in everything we do and how we do it (4/2015). Could "mass illusion"technology be used by "dark entities"to control the masses with false propaganda? There are "dark entities"or low frequency entities,such as the Illuminati.They are one of those groups of sentient entities who get attracted to different functions of being in power,being in physical power.They can and do control masses of individuals to be able to do certain things. When we see masses of individuals doing bizarre behaviors that the individuals themselves would never do,that's when a common desire creates that through a collective symbiotic function.In that case,the people self-hypnotize themselves. The other case is where a common desire is used and adulterated by dark entities who can access the functions that allow a desire to become manifest in the mind or subconscious of the people who desired it in the first place. Be careful what your desires are.If they're part of a mass function,then you give opportunity to being manipulated by those who want to manipulate you.Some marketing techniques use this when they make us feel inadequate,if we don't have certain clothes or material belongings.That's how that works these days(8/2015). Are there examples of mass illusions in our recent history (e.g.events of9/11,mysterious disappearance of airplanes,etc.)? I'm told there are lots of them,but it's difficult for me to pinpoint which one is of relevance.I'm being drawn to an image from the Second World War,a very famous photograph of a group of GIs pushing a flag up onto a hill to indicate that the American forces had won part of a battle and reclaimed some land.Apparently,the photographer who took that photo was never found. There's all sorts of different people who are claiming that it was their photograph.But in actuality,that particular image was "created"as a function of a collective desire to succeed in a battle(8/2015). Did the moon landing really happen? I'm told the moon landing actually happened.There's been lots of conjecture about certain military moon landings that weren't real,but my understanding is they were real.They were totally real and it was all by the seat of their pants.There's nothing in my mind that suggests that it's like the "Capricorn One"film where it was all on a film set and that sort of stuff. In terms of these mass illusions,we can create them ourselves through a group desire by going into a synergetic condition where groups of individuals work together to try and control the environment and they can do it.There are many functions on the Earth that do that-in politics and other areas.There are certain families,a small number of individuals who do control the physicality of Earth.They use this ability in various different ways to control the masses. But there is a small number of individuals who don't subscribe to the things they are being fed.Conspiracy theorists are also being controlled,so we have to be careful when we go into these theories, because that's another function of trying to control us.Disinformation is another way of controlling us.It's all part of the ability to control us by giving us something that we all want to know and work with (8/2015). I heard Dolores Cannon speak about HIV/AIDS being created by the government.What are your views on this? No,I think that's a piece of misinformation.What I am picking up is that certain illnesses are created through genetic dysfunction or energetic dysfunction or simply nature finding a way of reducing the population and keeping it in tune with the ability of the Earth to support it.There are areas where we have different viruses and bacteria. For instance,cholera,tuberculosis and black death happened in places where there needed to be a certain number of individuals removed from the incarnation,because that body type or genome type wasn't going to be efficient for future generations of incarnate beings. The entities that govern the use of the Earth and the use of the particular bodies to help us to experience and explore individualized free will through incarnation to the lowest frequencies within the multiverse allow certain body types or genomes to be removed from service at times. That is done through the introduction of various illnesses or viruses either directly through the Curators(maintenance entities,such as the elementals)or as a natural function of the Earth working on its own to reduce the number of incarnate vehicles within a certain location within it. It's a natural function of attrition,not something that's been created by a government.There's bound to be lots of different viruses that have been human-generated that have been cultured and cultivated,but this isn't one of them-although I'm fairly sure various different mutations of HIV are available in various covert labs around the world(1/2018). Are there human slave populations on Mars?Are ETs helping the Governments with advanced technologies in exchange for humans or resources? I'm just going to ask the question about this.No,there's no human slave colonies on Mars.There is no need for a colony of slaves anywhere when you have a level of advanced technology supporting your work. There have been interactions with representatives of other civilizations with most of the governments that are able or go out in terms of giving us little bits of information to help us move in the right direction.We don't always get technology.We sometimes get direction in terms of how to think,how to behave and how to act.Sometimes it's political directions to go in as well. Generally,the Earth is being fenced (quarantined),so there is a level of non-interaction.It's just observation unless certain incarnate entities are being requested to work by the group of disincarnate entities who are controlling the Earth experiment with individualized free will (2/2018). Is it true that there are "darker entities"controlling the Earth and us through money,media,our systems of law and government, including our incarnation? Well,yes,it's us!The darker entities are those entities that we give power to control us.Those are the Illuminati.They control a few things through money,through media,through laws,through unwritten laws,everything.It's just whether you choose to let that particular group of entities affect you at all. I know of the Illuminati and I think the Illuminati have a function. Their function is to give us choice to go their way or to go the way of higher frequency thoughts,behaviors or actions.I don't have any problems with these things.I don't let them have a grip on me.I don't let them control me,because I don't give them any time. The moment you start to think about them and think they have control over people is when they've got control over you.If you disconnect from that thought process,then you will never be controlled by those sorts of individuals at all(8/2018). Is it true that we have "implants"in our body to control us,control our thinking process and weaken our power of intention in order to take away our personal power? No,we haven't got any implants,but at times we do have energetic links with other individuals.Sometimes they are coercive links or just energetic links.Sometimes they're karmic links that can control us or take our personal power away.But when we start to work on ourselves, we can see these links and remove them,so that our personal power comes back. My understanding is that if you want to be controlled,you will be controlled.But it's not implants,it's simply energetic links or hooks or even astral entities that attach themselves to us to give us feelings of power or grandeur or coerciveness.In return,the astral entities take some energy from us to help them perpetuate their own existence.

The only reason why we might get implants from other entities within the physical universe is when a soul is doing two incarnations in two different species (e.g.human and alien)at the same time.They have agreed to have implants in their human vehicle,which is their "secondary incarnation"that is being monitored by the individuals in their "primary incarnation"usually at a higher frequency level. The implant in the human body monitors the interactive functions of the soul,which is split to animate two bodies in two different environments.The information helps educate those in the primary incarnation.But there's no other implants that I can see as being relevant at all.It's just how we interact with others and the power we give to others over us that can create these energetic hooks or links (8/2018). Corey Goode talks about Galactic interferences and government roles and their effect on this planet.What is your take? My understanding is that a lot of interaction with any other entities that are in the third frequency level that have been in contact with any of our governmental powers is detrimental to those other individuals, because our governmental powers approach it from a military perspective rather than a loving perspective.My understanding is that there is some interaction,but not much interference as such,because if they interfere with us,then they're stopping us having our free will to be able to do what we're doing. Right now we're surrounded by entities of a higher frequency.They are incarnate entities from different locations,different planets or galaxies within the first three frequencies and above that.Certainly,there's more entities in the fourth,fifth and sixth frequencies on the planet right now.We just can't see them. There has been interaction from the channeled perspective,because some of these entities of a higher frequency communicate with us telepathically.They're here to help us by changing our thought processes,giving us access to higher technologies to help us move forwards,but also to help us move forwards spiritually.But in terms of interference,they're not allowed to interfere.In fact,they're not supposed to interfere at all,because we need to be able to progress on our own in our own way. My understanding is that governments don't have any power at all to be able to communicate or negotiate with any higher frequency entities that are on the Earth.They think they have,but actually they haven't as such.Most of our governments are considered to be "uncommunicable,"because of there's not much coherence within our governments.Any entities that are around are backing away from any communication because of the incoherence still here(8/2018). How do we face 5G being brought in,listening to how it can manipulate our frequencies and destroy everything we believe in? Well,5G is simply an increased bandwidth,an assignation of frequency and the bandwidth associated with it.I'm not really understanding how it can destroy us.The difference between 5G and 4G will be the same as 3G and 4G.As more individuals use it,the bandwidth will be taken up and it will become slow.Then 4G will become faster than 5G,because there will be more people migrating to the 5G system than there are on the 4G. That is what's happening with 3G now in certain locations on Earth where the 3G infrastructure is still robust and faster than 4G,because the number of people using 3G is drastically reduced compared to 4G. The human form is adaptive.As we move up the frequency,our ability to cope with higher frequencies is increased as well.As we evolve,our body evolves and goes up the frequencies.When we ascend to the next level,which is the fourth frequency,we start to become more immune to lower frequencies,such as those used for telecommunications. The thing is to work on yourself and become higher frequency.The higher frequency you are,the more immune you'll be to the effects of lower frequency technologies in the physical world(3/2019). Is this just another experience that "humans"are going through?Or do we try to do something about 5G? It's just an experience.As we become more adaptive to the higher frequencies,because we work on ourselves and become more able to understand them,we'll start to get to the point where we don't need these technologies.Technology is a physical replacement,a low frequency physical replacement for what we can do naturally at a higher frequency even whilst incarnate. When we get to the point where we're in the 4th or 5th frequency level as an incarnate entity whilst on Earth,these other technologies around us will be unnecessary.We won't need to have them,because we will be more connected to Source and the greater reality. Then computing power won't be required.Telecommunications won't be required.Moving around the Earth by using a metal vehicle,like planes,trains,cars,ships,spacecraft won't be required either.The higher frequency we are,the less dependent we'll be on technologies and physical tools (3/2019). We were given free choice by the Source,but it will be taken away by 5G that can even change our foods?If it's just for "experience,"I feel sad for humans and Earth. It's a transitional point that we're in where we are experiencing the potential damage to the human form that results in things,like cancers for individuals who live close to high tension or electric cables and other airborne radiations,such as wiFi,Bluetooth,mega/gigastream telecommunications based on microwave technologies,such as mobile phones.But when we move up the frequencies,we will be immune to all this,because we will be higher frequency than these frequencies. They won't even affect us. Work on yourself,become higher frequency and become immune to lower frequency interference.That's the way to think about it(3/2019). Is it true that vaccines are harmful and our government is compromising our health with vaccines?Is all part of control and domination by our government and cartels? One thing is clear,we're lower frequency,so the physical body needs help at times.There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines.Vaccines are useful when we're incapable of healing ourselves or protecting ourselves energetically.If we don't have the right level of sentience to be able to work in higher frequency ways,for instance,and use our energies to be able to protect ourselves from disease or virus,then we are in the need for certain vaccines. There's been a lot of bad press about vaccines recently about being dangerous.That is not specifically true.Although we are steered towards medication that we arguably don't need in a lot of cases,some of the vaccines are necessary with certain individuals.Unless you are particularly confident in your ability to stop disease or arrest a disease by just using your pure high frequency practice or meditation,then I would suggest that vaccines are necessary. I really believe that,because there's a lot of backfill people on the planet right now.We've got a lot of individuals saying that we don't need vaccines,that people who are not able to make a decision for themselves,but follow the decisions of others are going down a path of not having vaccines,then we're going to be in a position where there's going to be epidemics of things like smallpox,measles,mumps,rubella and all these different things.They are going to come back in again.It's going to be quite an interesting time,if we don't take a common sense approach. My healing approach is that sometimes we can cure things totally with energy.Sometimes it needs a bit of help from the gross physical aspect as well and that's a balanced approach.Sometimes we can do miraculous things with energy,if the individual themselves wants to be healed and it's within their life plan to be healed.But sometimes the level of dysfunction or disease or virus is so heavily embedded within the gross physical,they do need a bit of help on the gross physical frequencies as well(6/2019). Is it true that fluoride in toothpaste calcifies and adversely affects our pineal gland?Is it put in toothpaste by our government to keep us from spiritual growth?Do you use it? I use toothpaste and it does have fluoride in it.A lot of what I use these days has baking soda.Fluoride is being put in the water by governments,because it's supposed to help with the maintenance of the teeth in a passive way,so it's been put there for a long time.It does create a level of calcification,since fluoride helps to rebuild any bone- based structures. Does it affect or block the pineal gland or get clogged in the pineal gland?I'm being told that the pineal gland is very,very complicated and has its own filtering to remove any potential blockage or calcification associated with fluoride intake to the physical.It's got its own immune system,if you want to call it that,to help stop physical things from stopping its functionality. So it's not designed to stop our spiritual growth,the original intention behind fluoride was to help our teeth.Those countries that don't use fluoride,you can tell the difference in the quality of people's teeth vs. those that do.With all these things,it's balance.If you feel you're having too much fluoride,don't use it.Use something else until you feel your teeth need a helping hand (6/2019). Is it true that computer games are nano AI technology to take control of our kids and the games open portals in kids'bodies? No.It is simply addictive,so therefore karmic.In terms of Al or anything,there are potential ways in which subliminal messages can be broadcast through.But I'm not picking up that it is a common thing that happens within certain computer games.I'm not picking up any specific complicated algorithms associated with computer games that can be used to take control of children.It's simply addictive and it's simply a fashion. If we didn't have computer games,they would probably be doing something else.Right now it's interesting to use computers,play games and interact with individuals who are playing games in one of these internet-based things where you're all playing against each other across various different countries. You can understand that it's competitive.But being competitive is part of a low frequency thought,behavior and action,because it's low frequency.When we've moved past the need to be competitive and be better than somebody else,then we will no longer need to play any sort of game irrespective of what it is-computer games or physical games (6/2019). Is it true that when we watch TV,we open ourselves to be attacked by parasites and portals and viruses from AI technology,because that is one way for entities to use our vehicle? I'm picking up there's a possibility of a small chance of a doorway or a keyhole to create it with the old cathode ray tube technology,because it was magnetic and resonance was involved.That is one of the ways we can create a locally high frequency. But other technologies,such as organic LED comprised of liquid crystal displays don't have the same type of magnetic technology.Now that we've moved into a more energy efficient but more complicated way of displaying things,such as television,smartphones,computers,etc.,the ability for entities to use those has been reduced.It's all to do with the magnetic effect and the magnets that are used to control the electron guns on the old cathode ray tube televisions(6/2019). What is your take on other higher frequency beings creating portals in our bodies?How do they create portals?How do we get rid of them? Basically,we do allow "walk-ins"at times for other souls to experience what we're experiencing in a passive way.That means they don't animate the body.Sometimes there is communication between these souls and the individual may be classified as "schizophrenic"with psychological issues. They can be cured,because a healer knows and understands how to reassign the command and control of the physical form back to the primary soul rather than the passive soul.They can also shut down the passive soul's ability to communicate with the soul that is animating the body. In terms of portals,once an aspect or soul is occupying a gross physical body,the only way that an entity can come into it is,if they break through the protection of the human aura or energy field,which is a byproduct of the chakras pulling in energies.When the soul is not paying attention or is intoxicated by drugs or alcohol,astral entities can create a symbiotic relationship with the aspect giving them feelings of grandeur,being bigger,more powerful or giving them the ability to coerce others. The human host gives energy to the astral entity to get feelings of power.But generally,an entity can't move in unless it's invited in which is something we need to understand.My personal feelings are that we don't have a portal within us,although there are individuals who can create portals,if they put their mind to it(6/2019). Many people in the spiritual community are following cults like QAnon.How are they able to generate support from individuals who wanted to raise humanity's consciousness?Is it advisable to assist our friends who are completely lost to such thought processes? It's their free will.That's what I've just been told straightaway.It's about wanting to be in communion all the time.When we are incarnate,we lose our sense of communion.When we are disincarnate, we're always in communion or in total connectivity with everything and everyone around us energetically.When we're here,we feel cut off, because of the drastically reduced communicative bandwidth with the Higher Self.That's what creates the ego.Then we want to feel like we're part of something,part of a community,so we seek communion. Basically,these cults or groups feed upon them.They understand the basics of using certain words to attract members by suggesting they're going to get things,like big love or change the world by doing this,that and the other.All they're doing is just controlling people's free will.Of course,it's their free will to be controlled. They feed,look at and understand the psychology surrounding certain individuals or groups of spiritual individuals and they use the words that would invoke their interest.If there's a number of them working together,they've also got a synergetic effect associated with the broadcast energy behind the message and get attracted to it. Unless you're detached from all of this stuff,you run the risk of being attracted and pulled into it.You really have to be very,very,very,very careful what you see and hear about.Use your intuition:Is this right or is it just misinformation or is it just nonsense? The problem with social media is it affects a lot of people very quickly. As a result,it gains a synergetic effect very quickly.That increases the energy surrounding it really quickly and massively.People sense this energy,but they're not able to discern what the energy is.They sense it as being big and they want to be part of it.That's the mechanics of how it works. How do you change somebody who is sucked into these things?It's difficult,because you will stand more chance of losing them as a friend by telling them that they've been suckered than if you're just there for them.Work on your own knowledge base,so your energies will in some small way counteract the energies of the other individual. If you know the truth and you felt the truth and you experience the truth,then you broadcast the truth.When these individuals are in your presence and your energies,they will also start to have a little bit of an antidote.The best thing to do is just be there as a friend,but don't be pulled into their energies or thought processes.Don't back it up and don't argue against it,because you'll just create resistance and they'll go the opposite way.Be there as a friend knowing that your own direction is right for you and that you're happy with that direction as part of your own free will(12/2020). Corey Goode said he was removed from this timeline to work for a secret space program to interface with the Galactic Federation for 20 years.Then he was brought back to Earth as a teenager,as if he had never left.Is there a Galactic Federation? What I'm being shown here is that there are many groups that you could call a Federation,if you want to call it that.There are many groups that work together depending upon their supposedly geographical location within the physical universe at this frequency or at another frequency in other locations.They tend to group together to work on certain projects and things that benefit them altogether. There's not just one,there are many in this group of three frequencies and other frequencies above this frequency(3/2021). Does the US government or secret space program have access to a "time machine?" There is no such thing as "time"and there's no device that we could use that would allow us to move from one particular event space to another.This is something that has to be done with our sentience.The object of moving from one event space to another is not something that can be done with a machine,it's done with sentience.It's done with extremely advanced meditation processes. If those individuals would be asked by governments to do this sort of thing,it would be a detrimental request,so they wouldn't be able to do it,because it's not advantageous to the general population.It's more of a negative use of a positive function of what we can do when we're higher frequency.It would reduce the frequency level of the participants(3/2021). Are the governments using time machines to predict and plan the future?Who are the people running the secret space program? There are people who are working with other entities who are incarnate.But they are outside of the knowledge of most world leaders and probably outside of the knowledge or communicative ability of those we call the Illuminati.There are individuals who are working here in human form,but for the betterment of humankind by working with other incarnate entities to monitor and work with how things are going-with the potential to change things dramatically,if required,if things go horribly wrong(3/2021). Is there a liberation of the planet at the moment with help from extraterrestrials?This is a common theme in the New Age spiritual and UFO community. We are getting help,but the objective is not to do things for us,but to help us help ourselves.There's an old adage that says,"Give a man a fish and you'll feed him for a day.Teach a man to fish (by giving them a fishing rod or even a line)and they'll feed themselves for the rest of their lives." The help we're getting is about how we think,behave and act and expand our acceptance of other form factors (species).To be honest, there's lots of humanoid form factors here on Earth.We've got the Afro-Caribbeans,White Europeans,American Indians,Chinese, Japanese variants of the chinese,the Maoris in the Pacific and Hawaiians as well.There are different variants of humanoids here already.

Some things happening on the planet are trying to teach us to be in more acceptance of our diversity and not think of ourselves as being a particular race or type of human being,but just a soul that is using a human body as a vehicle to experience,learn and evolve. Basically,we're all one and the same thing.It's just that we have the honor of being incarnate.It is honorable irrespective of whether we have a particular skin color,a lineage,whether we're born with a disabled condition or what we think is a disabled condition or not.The whole point is we're honored to be able to be incarnate.We're being helped to understand that(5/2021). Does the Galactic Federation exist?Is it a true Federation? My understanding is that there are groups of incarnate civilizations- meaning they've got a body type used by souls to experience,learn and evolve-that have originated from different locations within the physical universe or within the local galaxy and the different frequencies. Depending upon their frequency and their ability to move around the galaxy or the wider universe,they do in some respects group together to assist each other in the progress.When they evolve to certain levels of understanding,they understand the real reason for being here.As a result,they help each other to experience,learn and evolve,doing everything that they can do rather than trying to "war"with each other. So there are lots of different federations,depending upon the ability. Federations are groups.I think the word "group"is better,because "federation"gives a strange sort of angle on what a group of incarnate souls would do (5/2021). How does eating GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms)foods affect our physical body and energetic bodies?Is it worse than foods polluted by pesticides and herbicides? There's a lot of misinformation about GMO foods,specifically about whether their DNA has been modified.It may well have been tweaked to make it more resilient to certain blight,bugs,viruses,to allow it to grow bigger and in more diverse surroundings than where they are.If it wasn't edible for us,we wouldn't be eating it. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they are out of control.If these GMO foods are safe and they're not eradicating the indigenous crops,but provide more produce for a large population,then it's useful. It maximizes the potential of the land used to create them.It's significantly better than pesticides and herbicides,but at the end of the day the best food is natural food that isn't messed with. But having said this,mankind has been manipulating the genome of crops for thousands of years.The moment we selected the best seeds to be replanted and ate the substandard seeds for food,we started to select the strong in preference to the weak.That's genetic manipulation, because it's allowing the strong to exist by our interaction,not by messing with the genome,but by allowing the strong to regrow by consuming the weak.That changes the balance.It stops the plant from going through its own Darwinian evolution,because we're making it go through quantum leaps. This is what's happened sometimes with the human body where we've had other incarnate entities and some disincarnate assisting with the selection of certain bodies to allow us to incarnate on this planet and cope with changes in frequency.Hence,the different races that we see on the planet,which is highly diverse compared to what is out there in the rest of the physical universe(7/2021).

### 阴谋论

### Council of Twelve 

There are 12 different Councils of Twelve,each working at a specific frequency level within the physical universe.They are disincarate entities (True Energetic Selves)that look after the evolutionary efficiency of the universe by working closely with maintenance entities (Curators). In The History of God you wrote about the Council of Twelve that reside on Zion (a moon around planet Zorpeton).But in The Anne Dialogues you learned that there is more than one Council of Twelve? There are 12 Councils of Twelve and each of them has a different function within the structure of the multiverse.Each of them works with a specialism,which is the coordination of incarnation within a certain frequential level.There is one council that works with the first three frequencies(FB 1-3)and one that works with every frequency from the fourth to the twelfth level (FB 4-12). That only adds to 10 councils.The other two councils are involved with the animal genre or the backfill genre between the animal and the human.They require one council each for all of the frequencies that they work with.There tends to be only one level that those genres incarnate into,whereas our genre of fully sentient humans can incarnate into any of the frequencies within the physical universe. So there's 12 Councils of Twelve-ten of them associated with our human type of soul and the other two associated with the souls of the animal genre and backfill people (12/2016). Where is Zion located?Is that the only place they reside in or just a "vacation home"? Zion is a name that has been used for eternity in terms of human understanding.Its location is at the far end of our galaxy,but they move around the frequencies.When they're interacting with the Earth, they reside on that particular planet on the third frequency band(FB 3). But when they're working on other areas,they move around.They don't move around frequentially,because each of the different frequencies has its own Council of Twelve above the third level. This particular Council of Twelve works with the frequencies in the first three levels,but they move around.Although they convene in this particular area,they don't always work together.They work singularly depending upon where they are within the structure of the physical universe and what they're doing (12/2016). What is their function relative to Earth,our solar system,galaxy or physical universe? Their function is relative to Earth,our solar system and the rest of the physical universe on that frequency level.Their responsibility is the third frequency and the two below,which together equals the gross physical. They work not only on Earth,but in other areas as well of the physical universe on these different levels.Clearly,with the Earth being the only area where we have individualized free will,they have a particular interest in it.I'm told that one of the Council of Twelve is nominally interested in terms of what goes on this particular planet(12/2016).

Are they maintenance entities like the Curators?Or are they in the evolutionary cycle like we are?Or are they "overseers"guiding the guides? They are not really Curators as such.Although you could classify them as being Curators,they don't maintain the structure of the evolutionary efficiency of this part of the multiverse,because they are responsible for maintaining the way in which we interact with it. They're not quite Curators,they're more like guides.But they don't incarnate-they don't need to.They guide the way in which we interact in a collective sense with the environments that we incarnate within, so you could classify them as being more overseers than guides. They wouldn't guide the guides,but they're guides of a different type. They're sort of the bridge between the Curators and us as incarnate individuals.They form the link between those entities,which are maintaining the evolutionary efficiency of the multiverse-in this instance the physical universe-and those that interact with it,which are us and our guide and helpers.That's probably the best way to explain what they are (12/2016). Assuming that some group created the experiment that we are in, does that same group monitor us and help us improve as individuals? We are being monitored,molded and modified slowly and various different Curators work with the various different realities that are created within a particular event space and the various different event spaces that can exist.They work on trying to create a maze that we walk through that sort of adapts to us in the way that we are progressing. They're separate to those of us who are incarnate,but they monitor what we are doing.They try to help us where they can without overriding the individualized free will that we're supposed to have. When we have a choice to make,they give us the potential to make a more educated choice.That way they lead us down one particular path, which is a better path than the one we might have taken.None of these paths are wrong,it's just that some of them are more efficient than others. The evolutionary progression associated with these paths is pretty much the same,so it's how fast you gain that same level of evolutionary progression.They're trying to make us evolve faster,so they can help us move back up the frequencies.The group of entities that are monitoring the individualized free will experiment are helping us become more creative and more capable of using our individualized free will in a more accurate way (1/2018). Source said,"The committee and I were greatly involved in...those stored in the ark."Is this how Source works on planets using committees instead offiguring out things alone? The committees are entities and those entities are aspects of a True Energetic Self that are smaller individualizations of Source,so Source itself is really working to create that which is being done.It's a rather hierarchical structure that manipulates,plans,controls,changes, creates,de-creates and recreates things using a smaller part of itself. It is doing it,but it's allowing those other entities to help,because Source itself (like the Origin)can't go into the fine detail that we can go into.It allows us to do those things on its behalf,because we are it anyway.As we do things,we learn and so does Source,because we are Source(2/2018). Was the Lucifer entity's action an aberration and hardly ever committed by others in the energetic?Are there some rules or behaviors that are acceptable or unacceptable? Withholding information isn't a rare occurrence.In general,we all see what everybody else sees.We all experience what everybody else experiences,so to be led in a certain direction rather than being misled, like a bunch of people are being misled,is extremely rare. The individuals that the Lucifer entity worked with were guiding or administering the way in which we use the gross physical for accelerating our evolutionary progression.But Lucifer was being "economical with the truth"when introducing a new process-the use of individualized free will-to accelerate evolution. Lucifer identified all the positive sides of individualized free will,but did not present the negative sides-the potential for dropping down the frequencies rapidly,if aspects become addicted to the gross physical, which is karma.To be honest,it just shows you the evolutionary level achieved by some of these individuals who are in guiding situations. My understanding is that this level of direction is no longer available to individuals who are working with incarnates in the physical universe. They did not understand the full process of what could happen by introducing the new process of individualized free will. Now there has to be complete transparency in everything and no single opportunity for changing that transparency or not advising on something that is supposed to be transparent.This function of individualized free will that the entities themselves had has been removed,because it was identified that individualized free will even on the energetic level wasn't as pure as it could have been.That's why it's a really,really rare occurrence (12/2018). In The Origin Syeaks the Origin refers to "the designers of the human form.Who are they?Did they design human forms for many planets in our universe?In our multiverse? There are a number of individuals who are disincarnate,who are part of a Council.They are involved with the use and optimization of different locations within the physical universe for accelerating the evolutionary progression of our True Energetic Selves and their projected soul aspects. They design all the different vehicles and one of them was the human form.The human form has had a number of different iterations or versions.Some of them were created to compensate for the drop in frequency within the physical universe.We've got a number of different vehicle types that were designed by these entities that continue to evolve on our planet through Darwinian evolution. We also have other versions of the human form that were imported here when the frequencies dropped further,because a change in body type was needed to adapt to the environment without the need to redesign and develop a completely new body here. There are different types of Curators who look after the different planets,different sectors within a galaxy,different galaxies and different frequencies,so there's many groups of disincarnate entities who do these functions.Sometimes they have to incarnate to create some of these different vehicles or body types to allow them to experience the environment in different ways.They are constantly changing the human form(5/2019). In The History ofGod Source says that dolphins "arrange a meeting with the committee of man."What is this committee? Every frequency level has a council,so there's twelve Councils of Twelve.There's a Council of Twelve for each frequency within the physical universe.There's one Council or group of individuals who are working with,manipulating and adapting the environment that we're using to experience,learn and evolve in an accelerated way by interacting with a lower frequency environment that challenges us. The dolphins are in this environment as well.But the dolphins are significantly less contaminated by low frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions than incarnate mankind is.They have maintained their higher frequency,and therefore,can communicate with their guides, helpers and other entities that are governing the environment-the marina that is the Earth that is allowing us to experience individualized free will,work in the right way and experience accelerated evolution in the process(8/2019). How often does this committee meet?How many members? It's always there.It's always in session,so to speak.There's twelve members.This function of twelve is a function of the structure of Origin.Things are generally arranged in groups of twelve,because it allows the members or that which is being created to tap into the structure and the energies associated with the structure of the Origin and right down to the structure of the Source in a more coherent and powerful way (8/2019). Do representatives rotate in and out?Or is membership permanent? Yes,but not in our lifetime.There hasn't been a change in member in 45,000 years.Those who are part of this Council now have felt a responsibility for how things changed with the Atlantean period.They want to make sure that everything is going back to normal.They're struggling right now.They're really working very hard(8/2019). In The Curators are there any limitations to the form factors created by Vehicle Creators? There are no limitations to form factors(types of species).Basically, whatever is required for an incarnate vehicle to exist in an environment,which is considered to be an evolutionary opportunity, then there can be an incarnate vehicle created for that.Simple as that. From our perspective,it's only our imagination that limits us or our experience that limits it.There's no limitations(1/2020). Are the Curators robot-like or are they individualized,so each is a unique creation with different characteristics,tendencies and capabilities? No,the Curators aren't robot-like.The Curators are disincarnate entities who are simply operating on a different level.They operate in service to those entities who have chosen to interact and move into the evolutionary cycle to help the Source accelerate its own evolutionary progression as fast as possible. Consider them as being True Energetic Selves like ours that simply haven't decided to enter into the evolutionary cycle.That's a way to think of them.Their sole purpose in life or existence is to make sure that the multiverse is maintained in the most efficient condition for our evolution (1/2020). The depth of organization and activity needed to evolve in the multiverse is amazing.Why does Source create a low frequency environment that traps entities in a Karmic Cycle? In general,there is an unwritten observational rule that suggests that when we experience something,the harder it is to experience,the greater the evolutionary gain.Everything has to be experienced. Therefore,what we put ourselves into to be able to experience,learn and evolve,so can pass that evolution on to our Creator is done in such a way that is most efficient. If you're experiencing hardship,you're evolving faster than if you were experiencing pure joy.Pure joy is fantastic,but it is only a slight step away from what we are in the energetic.To experience hardship and difficulty really does catapult us evolutionarily,so this is why it's allowed.It's about balance.The physical universe is all about balance or duality(1/2020). Why didn't Source start with the next universe and avoid perpetual human misery? Basically,it's to do with us making the decision to experience things,to allow things to change,to create the potential to experience things in many different ways.We create the condition where we recognize that we've gone the wrong way. We have gone the wrong way.There is no doubt about that.There is a worldwide wrongness about what we're doing.But the potential for change later and the subsequent evolutionary progression is amazingly high.It's a little bit like a pendulum-when we allow it to swing down, it must swing back up.As Newton said,what goes up must come down and what goes down must come up.That's a way to think about it (1/2020). In The History ofGod Source said,"Don't forget that all bio life has been created by Me and some of my helpers."Were we created by the helpers rather than by Source itself? Source created all our True Energetic Selves.That's who we are.The helpers had enough evolutionary content to be given the responsibility to create certain conditions on the planet.Life on Earth was created by maintenance entities (Curators),such as creators of habitation, vehicles,population,atmosphere,etc. They put all those things on Earth,so the vehicles could used by souls to incarnate into.Some vehicle types have evolved or been abandoned or transplanted from similar environments within the galaxy to give us more biodiversity and to allow the vehicles to operate at various frequency levels(5/2020).

### Curators (Maintenance Entities) 

Curators are True Energetic Selves that maintain the multiversal structure for evolving entities (like us)in the evolutionary cycle.They create and optimize everything from the weather to flora,fauna,planetary,stellar, galactic,universal and multiversal structures to be ofservice to us. Are nature spirits an extension ofnature itselfor are they separate? They are separate insomuch that they have autonomy,but they are linked with the energies that they're supposed to work with.If we have nature spirits that are supposed to work with plants,for instance,then they'll have autonomy over those plants,but they'll be working specifically with plants.You could argue that they are linked in and part of them,but they're also separate. When I've seen nature spirits,they appear to be globules of energy that wander across my garden.It's like something needs to be worked with where the energy will move out and touch a plant in a certain way or spread the energy over that plant for a moment in time.They're attracted to a plant and they move further onwards. When I've seen the result of this,that plant starts to become more vibrant and its aura starts to increase.So you could argue that the nature spirit itself is of the same energetic subset as the aspect of nature that it is looking after.If it's the plant kingdom and it is being looked after by a nature spirit,then essentially they'll be a subset of that energy,but they'll have autonomy rather than a static existence. In essence,it's a bit like having a specialism where certain nature spirits work with certain plants.For instance,there will be the nature spirits that work with trees,because they will have a specialism with trees.A lot of the trees we have don't originate on the Earth,they come from other planetary bodies around the physical universe.Therefore,there is a link between those trees and the other locations around the universe. The nature spirits associated with those trees will not only have autonomy from the trees whilst working with the trees,but they're also able to migrate from those trees on the Earth to those trees that are elsewhere within the universe just to maintain the whole patch of those trees as "energetic gardeners,"so to speak(7/2013). What role do microorganisms play in making these connections happen? I'm being told that they are a physical representation of some of the base energies that are forming the building blocks of the physical universe(7/2013). Please tell us about the new book you're writing,The Curators.What are they? The title was given to me after the third page.This book is about understanding the Source's maintenance entities,which are those entities that aren't in the evolutionary cycle.They're purely of service to those who are in the evolutionary cycle. There are lots of different types,such as elementals,fairies,pixies,elves,etc.We know about others with higher functions,such as angels, archangels,etc.,that are names given to us by religion.There is more detail behind structure of the multiverse that our Source has created for us to work with. As we experience,learn and evolve,Source does the same thing.But on top of that,it's got this group of entities,that are maintaining its evolutionary efficiency and changing its frequential state of being and its ability to serve us,as we progress in our own evolutionary cycle.The Curators is all about these individual entities who are helping us and maintaining the structure of the multiverse(2/2016). What is the most amazing or surprising thing to come out of The Curators book? It's the complexity of the number of entities that are working with the multiversal environment to allow us to evolve(4/2017). There are many more maintenance entities (88%)than incarnating entities (only 12%). There's 88%of maintenance entities who are in the service of us as entities and 12%of us are in the evolutionary cycle.So out of 100%of entities that have been created by the Source,only 12%are in the evolutionary cycle.The other 88%maintain the multiverse. But the most amazing and surprising thing is the number of these different individuals,the plethora of different roles they've got,the fact that some of these entities manipulate event space to correct things and that actually things are steered to some extent. They do work with event spaces.They move event spaces around sometimes.They reconnect them.They transplant them.They create them.They uncreate them.They put them in stasis.They put them in quarantine.They do all sorts of different things to try to maintain the coherence and more efficient series of event spaces which is called an event stream. The amount of work they do is amazing.I'm constantly surprised at the amount of the work these entities do and the number of entities that work with the manipulation of event space.That's one of the most surprising things.Also the level of interdependability that these entities have-alot of crossover functions. You could argue that they are doing each other's work sometimes.But when I think about it,the maintenance of the multiverse must be such an amazingly difficult thing to do that we need all of these entities to do that.They must overlap and they do overlap a lot. That's one of the most difficult things that I've come to grips with is that the amount of work that these entities do in terms of manipulating event space,which is an intelligence in its own right within the structure of the Origin,and therefore,within the structure of the Source,and therefore,part of our multiverse. The fact that these entities deal with different realities and they work with the different fractals created by choice,by dualities,trialities, quadrualities,etc.That's quite amazing.I'm starting to realize that there does need to be this overlap to make sure that the work they're doing is coherent,repeatable and robust(4/2017). Why do the maintenance entities evolve more slowly than incarnating entities?Is it because they are so diversified in their functions? Yes,interestingly enough,guides and helpers evolve faster than any other entity,because they are given evolutionary content by the entities that they look after.As we evolve,we give our guide and helpers evolutionary content to thank them.You can rather jokingly call it an“evolution tax.”It's not.It's being in gratitude for the help that they've given us in our own incarnation where they've guided us through it and made us more efficient in terms of our experience and the reduction in karma as a result of that.But the maintenance entities are doing it purely out of service. They don't have the interaction with incarnate entities who are in the evolutionary cycle in the same way as guides and helpers do.They're happy to be evolving in a slow but consistent way.Although they aren't going to experience evolution as fast as those in the evolutionary cycle, they won't go back into communion with Source at the end of this cycle as fast as some of us will,because we'll finish our cycle faster than others. They will move back into communion with Source at the very end of the cycle when it's all done and dusted.They will have to evolve more slowly as a result of that.Eventually,they will get to the same evolutionary level. But they've got to evolve at the speed of the slowest entity,so that entity can finish its evolutionary cycle and go into recommunion with Source.When that happens,these entities who have been providing the environment for that last entity will then go into communion themselves.It's a function of what they've chosen to do. Each of us have a choice:Do you want to be in the evolutionarycycle and choose incarnation as a means of accelerating a cycle?Or do you want to go into service to be a guide or a helver?or do you want to go into service to maintain the environment for those entities in the evolutionary cycle?They're being of extreme service sacrificing the speed of their own evolution for the benefit of others.Nevertheless, they will evolve to the same level.It's just that they will wait until the last entity has communed with Source before they commune as well (4/2017). What are the Elementals?Humans know four elements:Fire,Water, Air and Earth plus Ether.Are there salamanders (fire),undines (water),sylphs(air)and gnomes (earth)? Elementals are nothing to do with the very basic medieval thought process of four elements.Clearly,the periodic table identifies a lot more than four elements,like uranium,strontium,carbon,oxygen, xenon,neon,krypton and a bunch of radioactive and nonradioactive elements.Fire,water,air and earth and ether are just a very medieval way of saying it.Ether is the spirit,isn't it?Before we invented the radio,the radio was classified as the ether.The elements and elementals aren't associated with any physical form in general or the old description of medieval elements(7/2017). How do the elementals work with energy or matter(Anu particles)? The Anu is the very first particle that's created as a function of dense or low frequency.It's six levels below the atom.Basically,they build, construct and dissolve various different things.The elementals tend to work on energies that are affecting things. For instance,if you have an elemental that's dealing with a certain function of the eco-structure,let's say,trees,then they work with the energies associated with what makes trees grow or what makes them die or resistant to certain viruses or attracted to certain viruses. The elementals work with the energies associated with programming the energetic templates associated with the environment.We've got seven energetic templates associated with the human form,such as the etheric body,emotional body,mental body,etc.They deal with manipulating things and working with the energies associated with changing the gross physical(7/2017). Do they work at many different frequency levels or just one level? It depends upon what they are.In The curatorsI haven't got anywhere near those entities that are specialized in working in gross physical environments,such as a planet.I'm still up in the higher echelons of multiversal beings.My understanding is that they can be both specialized and multifunctional.They can work on specific frequencies and on a number of different frequencies and a number of different functions that those frequencies have (7/2017). How do they differ from devas and fairies? Devas are classified as being gods and fairies are classified as being elementals,but these things are the functions of observation and incorrect recording of human beings.Sometimes if an elemental is seen by us,because we are more aware and awake or higher frequency, then they can give us the opportunity to see them in a more human way. They tend to give us an image based upon what we would like to see, such as images of fairies,leprechauns,other little devas,if we see them. If we're higher up the frequencies,we'll see them as they are in the energies and form factors they use to manipulate the energies in the environment they're working with. All elemental entities are part of the Curators.It's just a different structural level.I'm working on describing the higher levels of structure still,but I will eventually come down to those entities that work with the trees,plants,animals,weather systems and mountains and those sorts of things.They don't differ so much,because they are all Curators.It's just that these Curators have different functions and different levels of responsibility and that's it. Some Curators manipulate event space,others create structure or change environments or living areas as well.Each of them has an important role.Some of them are involved very close to us on the Earth level or other planetary levels,whereas others are working with much higher pieces of structure(7/2017). Note added:The Curators was published in 2019.What we call elementals or nature spirits are now called "Habitation Specialists." They work with each and every family of flora(e.g.trees,shrubs,herbs, succulents,etc.)and fauna (e.g.insects,fish,birds,rabbits,larger animals,etc.)as well as algae and bacteria in the eco-structure in all parts of the physical universe,not just on our planet.

How do they work with the dolphins or the planet Earth itself? Dolphins are a sentient entity.A dolphin body is simply another incarnate body for a fully sentient entity that is of a similar level or genre of sentience as humans.Even though dolphins have a gross physical body that we can see,they maintain a higher level of frequency and work on up to the seventh level (FB 7)whilst being on Earth.They can also work to help maintain the eco-structure they exist within.The dolphins can communicate with the elementals on telepathic and empathic levels. It's the same with the Earth,which is an entity in its own right that has a different way of evolving.Dolphins communicate with the Earth via this telepathic-empathic function and various different communicative channels well above our thought process, comprehension or even ability to think about it. We will understand this when our gross physical body demises.We all become self-realized whilst we're disincarnate.Essentially,there's not just speaking,hearing,sign language or telepathy,there's myriad other methods of communication,which I don't have a name for.Let's just call it over a million different channels of telepathy,so to speak,that allows the dolphins to communicate with the Curators we call elementals and the Earth(7/2017) What made you feel most excited while channeling The Curators book? I was amazed at the number of individual entities that had the ability to work with the different forms of event space and different realities. That was the thing that I found most exciting and most concerning, because I was starting to wonder,if I was going in circles when you look at the different functions of event space,how fluid it is,how it is changed around us,how we change it and how our guides and helpers change it. There are other entities that maintain the multiverse structure,but also change it to effect more efficient interactions of the individuals (incarnate or disincarnate)with the content of the multiverse,so they can experience,learn and evolve from it. You start to think to yourself,"Well,if everything is manipulated in such a way,is there such a thing as free will?"You start to realize that free will is sort of limited in all sorts of different ways.We need to understand that as we experience something in our individual linear way,there are other parallel aspects of us experiencing things in slightly different ways in different realities and different event spaces. Then you start to understand that some of them need to merge together.Some need to split out.Some need to form different versions of event spaces and some need to be terminated.This is what some of these Curators do. I don't even think I'm scraping the surface with the information in the book in the slightest.I was amazed to find out the number of different versions of event space,the number of different versions of realities or environments and how different entities manipulate these things or govern or maintain these things.That was the most amazing thing for me(11/2018) In The Anne Dialogues you had "a niggling feeling that...you are being pulled toward...nature."Are you still being pulled towards it? At the time I was feeling that with all of the nonsense happening around us that being involved with nature is a purer way of experiencing beingness.This is also about The curators,which has a large chapter on communicating with those entities we call nature spirits or elementals,so that's part of it as well.It's to do with how I was working with the entities called the Curators that work on the maintenance of the multiverse from an evolutionary perspective and how we can work with it whilst we're incarnate or in a disincarnate state as well(7/2019). Do nature spirits make a "business trip"to tall buildings,if there are lots of plants in flower pots that need to be looked after?How can we invite them to our living space? Nature spirits work with the plants and flowers anywhere.If plants are brought into a sterile environment,such as a building,then they are encouraged to grow and proliferate.If they're not supposed to be there, because the energy of the person is overcoming the work of the nature spirit,then that plant dies. If a plant dies in your living environment,it's because you're not giving it the right energy.You're not loving it,so to speak.You can invite nature spirits into your space by loving the plant and meditating on inviting them in and saying,"Can you come into this environment and help me help this plant thrive?"They'll come and you'll feel them and their wonderful energies(7/2019) How can we support nature spirits with their work?Is there anything besides planting more trees and making an effort not to pollute the environment? The major way we can do it is to stop polluting our environment.That's not just things like the exhaust fumes from vehicles,boats,planes, trains and automobiles,it's also the manufacturing processes.That's the major thing we can do.But we can also send them love and encouragement,so they know they are appreciated.That makes a big difference(7/2019). How does blessing and thanking food affect the additives or preservatives in them?Does it cancel out the negative effects or do they still affect our body? Blessing and thanking for our food is thanking the animal or the plant for giving up its body or an aspect of itself to nourish our physical body, because we're not able to nourish ourselves through energetics.It's thanking those entities of various different levels of evolution for giving up part of their incarnate condition to perpetuate our incarnate condition. If that food has been preserved,prepackaged and if additives have been used,then we can meditate on asking for those additives and preservatives to be neutralized.The best thing to do is to avoid foods with additives or preservatives.The best way to negate the effects of additives and preservatives is not to buy them. Keep food natural-such as foods grown in the ground without pesticides or only natural pesticides-using certain insects to get rid of other insects that are detrimental to certain plants (e.g.ladybugs eat aphids on roses).They will naturally die out or leave when the insects have been eradicated.It's all to do with using nature properly(7/2019). The History of God stated:"Nature spirits aligned with trees and forests are disappointed with the human race for destroying most of the forests and their disregard for nature in general."Are trees or plants aware ofhumans as a group or individually? Trees are aware of us.Forests are aware of us.They're a group sentience.They are like a True Energetic Self that's associated with a genre of plant life,whether it's trees,bushes,shrubs,smaller plants, etc.On a certain level of sentience,they are aware of us and they understand that they are struggling against us. If you have a forest full of oak trees,then the population of oak trees creates a different level of sentience and awareness or intelligence.If you reduce that level of forestation by cutting down some of the oaks, you reduce the level of sentience.That's equivalent to starting to reduce the awareness and the trees would eventually know that they're becoming less aware.Eventually,they get to the point where so many trees have disappeared,that they stop to have this level of awareness. It's a bit like the human brain.We think the human brain is who and what we are.If we take chunks of the human brain out,we start to lose our ability to control the body,to think,to perceive,to interact,to perpetuate the natural functions of the body that perpetuate its existence.We slowly start to fall asleep,so it's a similar sort of thing. When you start to reduce the level of ability of the sentience to proliferate,you start to lose that sentience as well.So they do understand,but on a different level.They understand that they are being affected by us,but they don't have the ability to change that.But they are aware that they're losing their sentience,their interaction with the physical through the proliferation of their form in the physical.They understand that they're losing it,but they can't do anything about it (10/2019). "Indeed,nature is part of the Source Entity (Me)or God and is, therefore,everywhere in all the galaxies in all the universes in all time.Thus,what we do here on Earth has an effect throughout the universe."How does this work outside ofEarth? With the trees,for example,they are connected together by an energetic network,not just with the gross physicality of what they are, but also with their genre and the sentience of what they are. There are oak trees of various types around the Earth and there are oak trees of various forms on different planets around the galaxy and the universe.There is a genre of tree available in various different types or manifestations in other locations and they're all connected. There will be a True Energetic Self or a larger group of sentience and energy that will be connected not only with those trees on the Earth, but in other areas where it has distributed its sentience and energy to experience,learn and evolve in different locations.What we do here does get passed on to other locations. For instance,a tree on the Earth is able to communicate with a tree on another planet in another part of the galaxy very quickly,if it's connected to a True Energetic Self of the same type.But those True Energetic Selves communicate with each other as well.

One TES of a tree genre,like oak trees,could communicate with another TES of another tree genre,like aspen trees,so information gets passed on from genre to genre,from planet to planet,from galaxy to galaxy through the communication among the TESs projected into different trees in different locations.The information gets passed around about how they're experiencing things(10/2019). The Curators confused me about "angels."Many people channel archangels,like Gabriel.What type of entities are they-are they curators,guides or helpers at TES or soullevels? They are maintenance engineers or entities.But we may refer to our guide as a "guardian angel"and helpers as "angels"as well.Sometimes they may call themselves a "higher force"from a religious perspective to make us sit up and take notice.Sometimes we need to be given something that we can relate to,including old teachings. The idea of angels or winged human individuals may be attractive to us,even though they are energetic entities and their "wings"are oscillating energy.The vision of a human being is based upon an interpretation and translation of what we're seeing vs.what we've seen before.We can see Archangel Michael or Gabriel or Metatron as being entities who are looking after the Earth and making sure that we're working in the right way-trying to put us back on track most of the time. They are maintenance entities and sometimes individuals do get in contact with them.They are definitely not humanoid.Depending upon how we access them,they tend to be either temporarily individualized as smaller aspects of a True Energetic Self,but mostly they tend to be at the TES level,because of the work they do. A lot of the work is happening on a multiversal scale and on a parallel universal scale.These parallel conditions created by event spaces are not just localized or galactic-sized but universal-sized and multiversal- sized as well.They have to be able to work on all these different levels concurrently.They can and do exist on all multiversal levels,but they can also focus themselves on one particular level,depending upon what they want to do and how they have achieved it. Although our guide and helpers aren't in the evolutionary cycle,they gain evolution from us.We give them evolutionary content for helping us,so they gain evolutionary progression as a result of working with us and for us.The maintenance entities don't get evolutionary progression.They don't seek it and don't gain it directly or even pseudo-directly,like our guide and helpers do.They gain it through the natural progression of everything and everyone from a holistic rather than individualized perspective (11/2019). We can help nature by visualizing a vacuum cleaner that sucks any pollution around us.How do we recycle what we have vacuumed? Pollution could be low frequency energy,so if you're visualizing hoovering it up,taking all the energy or low frequency debris from in- between the gaps in-between the individual vortices in a chakra,for instance,simply visualize a recycling bin that is part of Source. You're taking energy from a static environment and giving it back to Source,so it can be converted back into a more dynamic environment and reused again.It's a bit like recycling plastic packaging.When it's done its job,you're recycling it into a ground plastic substance that is reused to create something else.Think of it as Source's recycling bin,so the energy can be reused for something else(11/2019). The Curators called the Architects can manipulate,reverse or prevent cause and effect and modify the multiverse.Does that mean our Earth can never be contaminated or destroyed? The possibility of destroying the Earth is used as a self-imposed controlling factor to stop us from doing things energetically that we shouldn't be doing.Some of the devices we use do have an energetic effect on the Earth.It can also affect some of the entities that are incarnate at a different frequency associated with the Earth. The Earth is a panfrequential body.It exists on the gross physical level (FB 1-3)and nine higher levels(FB 4-12)in a compartmentalized way. You can experience the level you're on and those below you,but not the frequencies above you.In essence,it's a self-imposed controlling factor. It is impossible for us on this level to affect totally the parts of the Earth that are on the other frequency levels.We could never destroy the Earth,because we'd only affect what is on our level.There would be some bow wave effect going onto the fourth level from what do in the third level,if we produced a significant energetic force that connected the highest point of the third level to the lowest point of the fourth level. But we don't have the technology level to do that even with atomic bombs,neutron bombs or particle accelerators of any sort,size,shape or force.When we do get to the point where we could do it,we would be limited to only being able to affect the next level up. At that point,we would be more mature anyway.We wouldn't be allowed to have that level of technology in an immature way.It's a bit like giving a baby a match to light a fuse of a bomb.None of the guides and helpers would participate in such stupidity.We wouldn't be able to go that far and we aren't and we haven't in the past either(11/2019). In The Curators you speak ofisolating or removing event space during WWII,because of the atomic bomb.Another Earth was duplicated on which souls were left to deal with the aftermath of the atomic bomb. Is our concern about the Earth's environment misplaced? That feeds into what I've just said.We aren't in total control to destroy the Earth.We're only allowed to have our individualized free will to achieve what we need to achieve or experience.In terms of destroying our environment,we'd only be allowed to get to a certain level,because it educates us. As we destroy our environment,we destroy ourselves.But inherently, we don't want to destroy ourselves.Even the ego doesn't want us to destroy ourselves,because if the physical form doesn't exist,the ego doesn't exist.The ego is another controlling factor as well.The ego is used by maintenance entities to impose a means of self-control,so that we behave ourselves. But there are times,when certain aspects are taken out of this particular event space and placed somewhere else to play it out and brought back again.There are a number of good examples through history where something strange has happened that shouldn't have happened or where something that was going to happen suddenly didn't.I'll let you all think about that one.Have a good look through history,find out that something was about to happen and suddenly it didn't(11/2019). The Curetors stated:"The lower the number of Architects,the more supportable the environment is-as is its ease of use."What does this mean? If I invert it and say the more self-supporting the environment is and the easier the environment is to use,then the lower numbers of Architects are required to support it.It's sort of back to front wording. That's what happens sometimes with me.It's a way of saying the more self-sustaining an environment is,the lower the number of Architects that are required to support it (11/2019). The Curators refers to Orchestrators as Beings,but later calls them General Maintenance Entities.Since there is a difference between an entity and a being,could you clarify this? I'd classify it as a typo of sorts,because all of the maintenance entities or Curators are entities.Just to clarify them again: A being has been created through Darwinian evolution ofenergy where similar or same energies group together and get bigger and bigger that creates a level of natural gravitation.That creates a level of semi- intelligent desire to gravitate towards another energy to an intelligent desire to recognition of desire to recognition of self toto self- awareness,consciousness,creativity,modification of creativity,then the desire to create,modify and recreate.That creates a being. An entity has been created by another being or another entity by individualization of sentience and energy.Sometimes I may call an entity a being,when it should really be an entity and vice versa. Sometimes the terms or words are mixed up.But my description of an entity vs.a being is what it is.Entities are created by another being or entity.A being is created through Darwinian evolution.For instance, the Origin is a being,but the Source Entities are entities(11/2019). In The Curators the Enders,Beginners and Deliverers relocate events. Did Mandela die in one event space and reappear in another?Did we experience a false memory of his death? I'm told that this effect is happening with a number of other people. Rather than being a different event space,it's all to do with a walk-in,a change of soul.There's another young lady,Greta Thunberg,who is becoming an eco-warrior now.If you've seen the news recently,she's doing a wonderful piece of service to mankind. She's a very upbeat individual now,but previously suffered from depression.She became a different person,because the soul that's in the body called Greta is a walk-in.Her body was brought to a certain level of maturity by a different soul that knew that's all it was doing.It didn't really want to be here.At a certain point,the new soul moved in and that's who is doing the work now.That happens quite frequently. Basically,the body of Nelson Mandela had a walk-in just after being jailed.He was allowed to contemplate and understand the issues and create a different,more benevolent personality.The original soul in Mandela was more of a freedom fighter,but in the wrong way,whereas the new soul thought of a better way to achieve a similar thing. He had two ways of achieving the same thing-one was failing miserably,whereas the other one was going to work.It was based upon a more sympathetic understanding of how to bring peoples back together again(1/2020). In The Curators you referred to mankind colonizing other planets close to Earth.Where? There's a number of civilizations of mankind who have been on the Earth in its various different frequential conditions,that have left the Earth and colonized other planets right up to the center of the galaxy, so they are further away.They've just continued to do the work,but they're not involved with the individualized free will experiment, because they work in a more collective way.They have some form of individualized free will,but with a collective consciousness associated with it.They moved out before the Atlantean Age. There's a few from the Atlantean Age who were allowed to leave,but also had their individualized free will limited.They're outside of our detectability.They moved a long,long way away.Some of them- certainly the Sumerians and even the Mayans-also moved out of the frequential range,so they're quite some distance away.Local planets in our solar system or even Alpha Centauri haven't been populated in that respect,because they're too close to us (1/2020). In The Curators you wrote:"The drop in base frequencies of the Earth over the last six years leading up to a knife-edge change at the start of 2016."What is special about 2016? Up until around 2016 we were looking good and then it started to drop off.It was so subtle,almost like falling asleep gently in front of a fire. You start to go down and you don't notice it.We've gone from a very high frequency condition to becoming complacent.The world is in the complete sort of chaos is because of it. Rather than manage ourselves and use the observer self amongst us all collectively,we've let things go thinking that we're okay.When we let things go,free radicals come in,such as incompetent leaders and other things like throwing sweet wrappers out of a car window or things that people wouldn't normally do,but do now because it's okay to do so. We haven't gone through a knife edge per se,but we've gone through a rapid descent that is going to bottom out.When we start to work together properly,as a result of this viral pandemic,we'll start to behave,think and act in a higher frequency way and then we'll come out of the other side (3/2020). You wrote that further expansion will harden you for the work ahead that willtest you to your limits.Have you been sufficiently hardened to support the work you are doing? It's about me being able to cope with higher and higher frequencies, becoming more capable of coping with wider subjects and deeper analysis of those subjects and becoming more expansive.I'm working on The Om:The Uncreated Creations,which is going to stretch me.The next book,Beyond the Origin will do that as well(3/2020). Do we readers need to be hardened to process your latest book?Feels that way to me?

That's to do with The Curators.My advice is just read it and don't try to understand it.Once you've read it,give it a couple of weeks.Then read it again when you feel the intuition to do so.You'll find that the information will have pervaded you and you'll start to understand it better.It's allowing you to have the key to becoming more expansive (3/2020). In The Curators you said to Source,"I seem to be struggling with this book.I can't connect with it like I do with the others."Many readers can agree with you. Yes,the books have their way with individuals.Some people will fly through books and some people will struggle through books.They put it down for a couple of years,come back to it and then fly through it. The information is there for us for when the right time is there.If it's difficult to get through,that's because the platform for understanding the concepts isn't there for you right now. I have the same thing.Information comes to me when the time is right. If the time is not right,it's like hitting a brick wall.The Curators is a difficult book,so don't worry about it.Some people have swum through it.Some people have to read it about ten times.Don't worry. Treat it as a story,then maybe you'll get drawn back to it later.It's there for us to be expansive.If things weren't difficult for us,we wouldn't be expanding.If they are too easy,we'd be bored(5/2020). In The Curators SE1 said we are in the third evolutionary cycle.Before all TESs become Source Entities we need over one thousand million cycles.Am I reading this right? Yes,you are reading this right.But we have to understand that as we move through an evolutionary cycle,we experience,learn and evolve an awful lot.When we move into the next cycle,the period from start to finish becomes accelerated.For instance,the second cycle was considerably faster from start to finish than the first cycle was.The third cycle is unbelievably faster compared to where we were in the second cycle. We start to increase very slowly like a logarithmic curve from one cycle to another to where we can go through a cycle in a blink of an eye or less.Don't worry about these numbers,which are inconceivable from the human perspective.It's about understanding that the more we go through,the more evolved we are and the faster we can go through the challenges associated with those evolutionary cycles (7/2020). SE1 said,"Some small part of my sentience is focused on you and a few others right now."Who are these others?Do they channel,write and function like you do? I don't know who they are,but they are going to be people who are doing similar roles to myself whether they are visible or covert or in the background.There are people who are trying to create a different way of existing on this planet-Greta Thunberg is one of them and the other White Children.They are trying to make us think,behave and act in a more holistic and service based way. They are going to make a big difference whether they are visible or invisible.Some of them are going to be quantitative teachers (with many followers),some are gualitative teachers (with fewer students) and some are going to be in the background(covert). I'm being shown that the Source has got its eye or some part of its sentience focused on the White Children plus those one or two people who are doing this sort of work in humility.We have to do it in humility.We have to get it as right as we can in spite of the frequential turbulence at times(7/2020). SE1 referred to "any part of my multiverse and those parallel environments that could,can and will be created."What are these parallel environments in SE1's multiverse? The multiverse has two functions.It is a metric for our evolutionary progression.It is also an environment for us to experience,learn and evolve to advance in our evolutionary progression.Being involved and interacting with it,we have choices to make.We sometimes make choices based upon what we experience,what our circumstances are and what our interactions with individual entities within those circumstances are. When we make a decision,we create a parallel condition,because we can go one way or another way.We usually have two or three or four choices.Those choices create many parallel conditions-localized environments,localized universes or even parallel multiverses.It's all to do with how we as entities work within the multiverse and how our individual and collective decision processes create numerous parallel environments or realities within Source (7/2020). SE1 referred to "a few low frequency incarnates having sporadic contact with us."Does this explain the "negative contacts"that some humans have had with aliens? Yes,and there's some backfill people who are here but also not quite here.Some of these backfill souls are also in different incarnate vehicles,which aren't human,so they can come from different locations within the galaxy or the universe.Sometimes we have what we classify as "negative contact"with other entities.But we have to understand that some of these contacts are based upon our desire to work with some of these souls in different incarnate vehicles. Sometimes they're part of our "primary incarnation"as another form factor (species)at a different level.That's where we come from and they're just monitoring our human form.What we call "abduction"is the same as us going into the wild,taking an animal out of the wild, taking its blood pressure,temperature,etc.,and tagging it,so they can track down its habits.It's the same sort of thing. We have to think of it not being negative,but mostly being misunderstood.But some of these entities are not of the same sentient quality as those who incarnate into the human vehicle,because they can be the backfill entities that are less sentient than us(7/2020). SE1 talks about the romantic side of "attraction"which is an agreement between souls before incarnation.Are all romantic attractions arranged in advance? Yes,it's not just about romantic relationships,it's about working together and being in certain circumstances together.Maybe we have health issues we have to work with.Maybe we have certain experiences that we need to work together to experience it properly.

Everything we do has a life plan associated with it,but the life plan is only a series of goals.It's not really much deeper than that.How we achieve those goals within the life plan and who we achieve it with is part of our individualized free will.Some of those individuals we achieve it with are part of the goals of the life plan,because they want to experience similar things,but from a slightly different angle. It makes sense to incarnate with a soul who wants to experience something similar,so you can work together,so everything is experienced upfront.It's interesting to think about the number of times we've had chances to be with a different partner that we don't take.Those missed opportunities have been missed,because our guides and helpers have been changing our thought process or not making the decision fast enough,because we're supposed to be with somebody else. That's another way to think about it(7/2020). In The Generators,you give readers a mental break from the difficult concepts.I find The Curators to be so dense as to no longer be much of a spiritual help to me? I have to admit that the information coming through was difficult for me as well.But it's to do with expansion.Not all of us can be expansive and expand at the same rate.There's nothing wrong with that.That's based upon our evolutionary level and what we need to understand at a particular point in our existence.We have to think of this not just as spiritually progressive information,but hard metaphysical information as well.Some of it is so far advanced that it can be meaningless to us until we get to a different level of understanding. If we are finding that the information is too hard to grasp,don't worry about it.Either put the book down and use it as a door stop or the end of a book shelf.Some time in the future you will want to pick it up and you'll be ready for it.Or just read it and treat is as a story and don't try to absorb the information.The information will be downloaded to you as and when it is required. Remember we can't do quantum physics unless we've gone through the primary stage of first understanding a times table and our arithmetic. When we've got to the point where we can start to think about quantum physics,then we're going to be exposed to those concepts and levels of detail associated with that when appropriate. All of you who have read The Curators are finding it very hard.Don't worry about it.Just read it and let the things absorb in a natural way. Because you've gone through the process of buying it,it's going to mean something to you at some point.It's a bit like learning a language. We don't always learn every word straightaway.Simple words sometimes elude us and take three or four years to be absorbed in our memory set whereas other words we know straightaway.It's a bit like that(7/2020). SE1 said that Parallelism Engineers reinforce demarcation lines,like a new fashion craze,a political situation or filming the murder of George Floyd.Is this indeed an example? It's one of them definitely.When we see things that come from nowhere where there's no quantifiable reason for it happening,that's when we know that Parallelism Engineers are starting to change us from one localized reality to another one.That happens when where we are headed is not going to create an advantageous condition for us. They are helping us take the right steps,helping us realize that we are just incarnate souls in a vehicle that we experience in this planetary location within the physical universe at this particular frequency. That's it.There should be no discrimination as to where we're born, what version of the human vehicle we're working with.Everything should be the same. We should be having the same educational capabilities irrespective of where we are on the world.We should be having the same ability to exist and live.We should be having the same remuneration capability and the same capability to exist in a home that is of a similar quality worldwide. There are other humanoid versions around the galaxy and around the physical universe.We will start to see these other body types,because they're already here,but probably not in our lifetime,because we're not thinking,behaving and acting in the right ways to advance up the frequencies yet.As we ascend,we'll start to be exposed to these different entities,different versions of humanoid conditions. Just look at the different humanoid versions you see on different science fiction films-that's part of the education for us.If we're still discriminating against somebody's skin,ethnic location,thought processes,religious context,then how are we going to cope with the other variations upon the human body theme? When we start to think,behave and act in a mature way and we see people for their achievements and their personalities,not their body type,then we're going to move up the frequencies much faster.The filming of the unfortunate murder of George Floyd,who by the way agreed to be a force for change in a parallel condition,is one way in which we're being given a nudge in the right direction.The problem is we need to make sure that nudge is in the right direction and not taken in the wrong way (7/2020). In The curators we learn there are at least a 120 times as many variations ofform factors (species)on Earth for incarnate experience compared to the rest of the physical universe.Is Earth a very,very special place in the universe,much more desirable than any other? Yes,it's a very diverse planet and we're very systematically making it "undiverse"by putting different flora and fauna into extinction.That's a tragedy.We don't understand what we've got until we've lost it.On top of that,because it's got this diversity there,it's part of the opportunity for us to understand how to think,behave and act in a higher frequency way. We are allowed to do that on an individualized basis without any responsibility to anybody else or even ourselves.That's part of the individualized free will.That's what makes Earth very,very special.It's the only place in the whole physical universe that's got individualized free will and the diversity of flora and fauna(10/2020). Anne suggested you open your eyes in Crete.You were amazed to see the hillside full of Habitation Specialists (nature spirits).What did they look like? They were balls of energy.They create a condition to enable them to manipulate the environment,work with it,improve it,change it,etc., in whichever way they need to.They have the capacity to recreate anything,if they wanted to.If they really,really needed to,they could totally recreate all the rainforests.They can operate a bit like a 3D copier,if you use Earth based terminology.They can create anything and they do so. But the hillsides around Crete are full of all sorts of different things They've got the aliens that I've met that are still here.But these habitation specialist entities are just multifunctional multiform energy.They have a basis of being sentience and energy,which is manifest to me as a ball.But they may look like other things to other people as well.Sometimes they have different roles(10/2020). In The Carators Anne lists a lot of different habitation specialists starting with Bacterial Workers.I was expecting Virus Workers,but they were not discussed.Why not? I'm being told that bacteria are part of the environment,part of its normal function,but a virus isn't.Viruses come along and inhabit various different life forms and kill them.They move around the Earth. They're part of the normal defensive system of the Earth. They're a function of the Earth,not of the maintenance of the Earth, because the Earth is an entity in its own right.It's got its own sentience and has its own functionality.The Habitation Specialists are helping to maintain certain functions of the Earth,but the virus is part of the Earth itself on its own.It doesn't need to have any other specialist working on it to maintain these things(10/2020). Anne talks about the flora and fauna that live in nebulae.The fauna take sustenance from some ofthe fauna.Are there carnivorous fauna living in nebulae? It's not classified as being carnivorous,it's more to do with creating balance.They would absorb things rather than be carnivorous.I'm being shown that it's a function of maintaining balance. If there's more of a certain type of fauna,then its numbers are recalibrated to put it back in balance.It's more like a natural balance in the nebulae where the balance needs to be maintained.If one thing gets more than another,they change it. Mankind is very good at knocking things off balance.For instance,if you have too many rabbits,the fox population can grow to a size where there's not enough rabbits to sustain them,so the foxes start to die off. Then the rabbit population starts to increase again.It's this natural function of ebb and flow of balance that's being created.This is why the Habitation Specialists around the Earth are working very,very hard to put things right and why the weather systems are changing(10/2020). In The Curators you discuss the difference between a "being"and an "entity."Per SE1,a being is created sentient whereas an entity develops sentience on its own.Do you concur? No,I think there's a bit of a typing error here to be honest.It's easy to get confused.Just to explain the difference again: An entity is sentience,which is individualized from another entity or being.A Source Entity is an Entity,because it is created from the individualized sentience and energy of the Origin.Our True Energetic Selves are entities as well,because those are created from the individualization of sentience and energy from the Source Entity.Our souls or aspects are the same and created by our TES and so are shards that are created by our soul. A being is one where the energy has gone through a level of Darwinian evolution where it has created its own sentience as a result of going through a number of different steps described in The Origin Speaks ("The Road to Sentience").The being is created through its own evolution,as its energies go through a multistep process of creating levels of attractivity,minor intelligence,consciousness,awareness, self-awareness,creativity and ultimately sentience,then recognition of its sentience and how that sentience can be detached from the energy that gave birth to it. The Origin is a being,so the Origin is self-derived.It is sentience that has been created as a function of its own evolutionary path even though there was some assistance from Event Space.Event Space gave up its own potential to be the dominant sentience when it recognized that the Origin could be a bigger,much more complete level of sentience.Therefore,the Origin became the dominant being that allowed the Source Entities to be created to understand itself better. The Origin is a being,not an entity.The Source Entity is an entity,not a being.Our True Energetic Selves are entities.Aspects are entities. Shards are entities.There are clearly other levels of sentience that are created and classified as beings.There are some Sources that are self- generated,as a function of energies collecting together and then going through the processes of "The Road to Sentience"described in The Origin Speaks(1/2021). Are Generators always successful in creating new materials?Don't they ever fail or have accidents?Do they use Event Space to avoid failure? For those who haven't read The Curators,the Generators create materials.They don't see what we classify as failures as being a failure, they just see it as being knowledge and the evolution of knowledge to be able to do what they're doing.They may or may not use event space as an opportunity to shortcut things. They're saying we enjoy doing things,making things and the process of developing things.What the human thought process would classify as a "failure"is actually a different level of success.It's the elimination of a route to creating what is desired.I think we should all think along those lines(1/2021). Only the highest level of Curators can create or uncreate a General Maintenance Entity.Doesn't a General Maintenance Entity ever fight back for its existence? What I'm being told is don't think in that way.It's like they're created as a tool,an autonomous tool.When the use of that tool is finished,it's reabsorbed.It's uncreated.When you've finished the job,you no longer need the tool,so you modify the tool to do something else. It's a bit like having a motor car.When the car starts to fail and gets old, you disassemble it.You melt it down and create something else with the materials.The General Maintenance Entities simply don't have the ability to go down the road of wanting to maintain their own individuality (1/2021).

In The carators it stated:"The more disharmonious frequencies that are combined,the more complicated the energy.The more complicated the energy,the more capable it is of being able to perform more advanced and smaller tasks."What are some examples? I'm being told it's to do with the structure,creating the structure of the universe or things that exist within the universe.For example,things like black holes or wormholes are based on the ability to connect two frequencies within the universal environment together. I'm seeing things like a nova in the gross physical universe.It could be a sun going supernova.The collapsing of that star creates that condition that could potentially be used,but isn't always.It's very rare that a star going supernova and collapsing in upon itself creates the condition of connectivity where the locally high frequency of a lower frequency is in contact with a locally low frequency of a high frequency in the universe. Those things can be created without a need for a wormhole or a black hole.I'm being told that the use of those disharmonious frequencies can create these connections as well.They can be created by entities, like a Curator who is very adept or very high frequency who creates these things to manipulate their environment(1/2021). In The Curators SE said any evolutionary progression that is not part of the plan...is a bonus,but its product cannot be used in the management.How does SE use this bonus? What I'm being shown is that it is evolution,which is there that the Source experiences and absorbs,but it can't be used to manage things. Basically,any entity that's created or any sentience that's created as a result of Darwinian evolution that is outside of what was expected- that's a bonus. But it can't be used to manage things,so it can't be a Curator,for example.It's like an expansion of the Source's sentience,but it's just an expansion.It's like putting extra memory into your computer.It becomes part of the computer.It's a bonus,an extra memory set.But it can't be used to maintain the computer.It's just part of the extra nemory(1/2021). Would dragons be Caretakers (Environment Specialists),as they seem to be involved with taking care of the Nature? In terms of dragons,they are still part of the physical universe,but exist in a different frequential level.I'm not picking up that they are Caretakers so much,but they are more in tune with that type of work in the natural environment,whereas some of us seem to be in tune with it and others don't,so there is quite a contrast there.Although they're not Caretakers,they support the maintenance of their own interaction with the natural environment around them. There are times,when some of the Caretakers who are working on the gross physical aspect of the universe and where we are on the Earth may well adopt an image or have an appearance that may be interpreted by us as being dragon-like.Sometimes there are Elementals,such as pixies,fairies,leprechauns,etc.that are interpreted as being human,but they aren't human.Sometimes those Elementals may have an appearance that is translated as being dragon-like, although they're not dragon-like.

This is something we tend to translate ourselves,based upon what we've been educated in,whether it's been incorrect or correct education.My understanding is dragons are a function of a slightly higher frequential level in the universe that we are existing within, specifically within the fourth and fifth frequencies (FB 4-5).They are present not only on Earth,but on other locations as well(5/2021). In The History ofGod SE said everything was created in perfection to start the job instantly.The only changes are what you and your "opposite entities"have created,including the human physical vehicle.What is my opposite entity? These are what I now call the guide and helpers and the maintenance entities that are not in the evolutionary cycle.They are in service to us who are projecting a small aspect of ourselves into the various locations within the physical universe to experience,learn and evolve by experiencing how difficult it is to operate in low frequencies. So these "opposite entities"are really the guide,the helpers and the Curators.At the time of writing the first book,I didn't really recognize the backup we have when we have an incarnation or the level of work being done in the background to maintain the evolutionary efficiency of the environment we're in(12/2021). In The History of God SE said the perfect stars you see are "the guardians of the universe."Some of them have visited our planet. Have you consciously met any of these entities? Yes,these entities are managing the Earth,which is panfrequential (exists on 12 frequencies).They are the Curators and the Council of Twelve.There are Councils that work with each of the major frequencies within the physical universe.Aside from the guide and helpers,these entities understand how the human form can be modified to cope with the changes in frequency. They can't cope with it themselves,so they maintain the possibility of gaining accelerated evolution through individualized free will.They make sure that everything is happening in accordance with our desires on behalf of the Source,to observe how we interact with the environment and each other to experience,learn and evolve on the Earth.Clearly,I've experienced quite a lot of them in writing The Curators(12/2021). Do they guide us in addition to our main guide?Are we surrounded with helpers? We're surrounded by our guide and helpers who are there to subconsciously nudge us in the right direction in conjunction with our life plan.But these other entities aren't there for our guidance. Sometimes they are there to guide our guides or assist our guides, communicate or act in communion with our guides.They might be working with our True Energetic Self and probably our guides while we're incarnate. These entities are part of the Council of Twelve that are on the gross physical levels,which is where we are(FB 1-3).If we're incarnated into the fourth level,then they would be communicating with the Council of Twelve on the fourth frequency as well(12/2021).

### Disease Conditions 

Why do our bodies die? It's because we let them as part of the "negative"programming,which we are subjected to from the point of conception onwards.We are also programmed to believe that the body grows and demises.We're so engrossed in that belief system that we actually "kill"ourselves,which is a bit of a dichotomy really,because we don't really want our physical body to die.In our ignorance of the greater reality,we want our physicality to perpetuate itself ad infinitum. In essence,we are so programmed by everything and everyone around us into believing,and therefore,associating the intention to the "fact" that the physical body dies.Then we make it get old,dysfunctional, diseased and die.It's part of a group or a collective dysfunctional process that suggests that we actually do create our own demise from that perspective. It's only when we have a greater experiential understanding of the greater reality that we realize that actually we can control our physical bodies,should we give ourselves time to meditate in the depth required and work with the energies that are required to ensure that we can reverse all of this adverse belief system.Then we could perpetuate the human form as long as we need to. In fact,a lot of yogis in India have managed and mastered their thought processes,so that their physical bodies don't demise.They stay in a certain age profile,which is specific to the age of the physical form when they achieved enlightenment. More adept individuals,such as Babaji and Krishna could perpetuate the human form and change its age-based appearance,so it could appear as extremely young,beautiful or old and haggard,because they were in total control of the physicality that they were inhabiting.That's the reason the human form dies.We make it die by agreeing with false information that we've created an experiential reality with(11/2012). How do we harness our own tools for self-healing? There are certain built-in knowledge elements that we can tap into that we never lose,that we just forget about.When we're taught to work with energies for healing processes,such as doing reiki,reconnection, Brennan healing science and other types of healing modalities,these in the right hands with the right level of skill can be used to heal the physical form from the energetic downwards. If we are inexperienced,we'd need to potentially use both traditional (western or allopathic)medicine,which is the use of drugs to heal the physical form whilst also affecting healing on the energetic form. Most dysfunctional energies,such as those that create cancers,tumors, viruses,etc.,are all based around energetic dysfunction-whether it's dysfunctional thought processes or habits we create and use whilst we're incarnate or some that we bring with us,as a result of our addiction to physicality on Earth. We can teach ourselves by being aware of what is wrong with us,if we can through introspection and meditation identify that part of us that is dysfunctional,why it's dysfunctional and how it can maintain its true balance.Then we can heal ourselves in that way.That takes a certain type of individual with dedication,commitment to meditate and learn how to do various healing modalities (e.g.reiki,Brennan, reconnection,psycho-spiritual healing,etc.) On top of that,we can also use certain yogic techniques to help us,such as pranayama based breathing exercises to re-energize and reactivate the correct flow of energies throughout the spirituo-physical and pure energetic aspect of the human form. If we can do that,then we don't need to learn any healing modalities, because we are achieving a balanced state that negates dysfunctional energetic and frequential activity.Therefore,that stops the manifestation of that dysfunction in the gross physical form.There are stories of certain individuals that have been able to effect miraculous recoveries from certain terminal diseases in this way (11/2012). When someone dies and their organ is donated and transplanted, what happens if the donor reincarnates? There is usually enough time between being disincarnate and being reincarnate to allow the association with the physical body to be removed from the transplanted organ,because of the demise of that body from old age or accident,as the case may be.The organ transplant occurs,because there's been an agreement to do it pre-incarnation. There is a level of energy in that donated organ that now goes to the recipient.Some aspect of the donor that is still associated with that organ collects incarnate data on behalf of that individual.Even though the organ is donated and transplanted,it will never take on-board the energies associated with the new host body,so it always maintains the energies of the first incarnate host. In effect,what we get is a possibility for a partial personality change, because there's aspects of donor personality going into the recipient. (For instance,when an elderly woman received the heart of a young motor cyclist,she had cravings for hamburgers,cigarettes and jazz music,which were never part of her life before the transplant.) Even though you've got physical compatibility,you may potentially get energetic incompatibility as well.Some of those energetic incompatibilities need to be dealt with by using either energy-based work or in our ignorance,drugs that suppress the immune system,so that that organ isn't rejected (11/2012). Why do so many souls choose to have debilitating neurological conditions,like stroke,Alzheimer's,Parkinson's and other dementias in their later years? Talking about the dementia types,my understanding is that these are ways in which we leave the body,specifically the Alzheimer's and senile dementia and to some extent Parkinson's as well.They tend to be a condition of where the soul starts to really depart,but in a gradual way. We do start to get problems with memory,because the memories are associated with the ego,which is created as a function of the separation of the aspect from the True Energetic Self.When the ego starts to move away,those memories go as well.The ego disappears after the total demise of the human form. But the memory set and the experiences associated with the ego get passed on to the TES on a continuous basis,just as a function of normal incarnation,so nothing's lost.But the day to day functionality does start to deteriorate.Things like AD are chosen ways to depart,but it's also the way a soul or aspect of a TES moves out,so the memory set dies as well(7/2015). Does it have to do with a life review of sorts? No,it doesn't have to do with the life review.The life review is something completely different,as described in The Anne Dialogues.I was surprised at how deep it goes,because the life review involves not just the soul who has been incarnate,but all of the helpers and the main guide who was working with the person and the other helpers and guides who were part of that life plan. A whole team of entities were keeping the "ward"on the life plan.They are involved in the review to see how things worked,why things went in certain ways,how the interaction with the incarnate aspect was working,how much nudging,pushing and cajoling they had to do to keep it on the path,etc.(7/2015). Is it the same case for Lou Gehrig's disease(ALS)and Creutzfeld Jacob disease? Yes,it's a similar thing.Although it's a chemical and biological condition that the body is going through,it's a function of the soul's desire to go.The human form will sort of "attract"the disease or dysfunction that's associated with a function of experience as well.The aspect will try to maximize its evolutionary condition whilst it is activating the demise process. Some aspects clearly go at a moment's notice with things like strokes or heart attacks or aneurysms where there's a sudden death.Those are a quite quick way of demising and leaving the body,whereas some brave souls decide to go slowly.Part of that is the attraction to a certain disease that allows that to happen with conditions like Alzheimers or other forms of dementia where the body is being exited on a slow basis (7/2015). Is it to experience physical disability to contrast your life experience with a fully operational vs.partially operational brain and body? Basically,when the soul leaves the body,usually the soul still wants to experience,learn and evolve,which is what it can do.It's maximizing its incarnate condition,so it can gain more "evolutionary brownie points,"so to speak (7/2015). Is it to reverse the caretaker role with other people (e.g.family)who have to take care ofthe elderly person? The answer is yes,where that is available,because all of these things are intertwined.If it's not available,the answer is no,if there isn't the ability to do it-for instance,if a child lives in a different country from the parent.But where a child does live close to the elderly parent who is experiencing these things,then the opportunity to work with their parents is there to experience and demonstrate things like compassion, love,friendship,tolerance and those sorts of things that are required when working with people who do have dementia. I know from my mother-in-law's state of mind and my father's continuously degrading state of mind with his Parkinson's disease,that it's quite a challenge,particularly if you're okay and you don't really understand or appreciate what they're going through.I do have to say that those people who choose to take care of these individuals who wanted to experience this type of illness are very special people.I respect them for what they do and the amount of tolerance, understanding and empathy needed to look after them.I always take my hat off and bow very,very low and deeply to people who are working in the field of palliative care(7/2015). Do all parallel versions experience the same disease condition or only some of them? Clearly,if there's a number of different parallel versions created through event space,it is very possible that there is more than one version that is experiencing the same sort of demise,but in a slightly different way or the same way.So it's possible that some parallels do and it's also possible that some of them don't experience the disease at all. That may be,because some parallel version of us may have decided to experience that life in a slightly different way.Maybe they took a different path 20-30 years ago (e.g.smoker),so the person has a different life.Sometimes that path might be an early demise in that condition,so that particular event space and the evolutionary progression from that collapses back into or close to the main line life, which continues. This is interesting,because from the perspective of all the parallel conditions of what we are,there are different versions of me or you or any one of us.We all think we are the main line,but in actual fact,we might not be.As long as we can accept that and just keep going anyway, it doesn't matter and we can experience what we're supposed to experience(7/2015). Can an aspect die in one parallel life while the others keep going? Yes,aspects can die in a parallel event space and the others keep going. In fact,the main life line will continue to exist right up until the last one.When the last of the parallel conditions collapses back into the main life line,the main life plan or the main incarnate condition can and probably will demise as well,because the reason for them being there is finished.If they continue,they would create more parallel versions of themselves. I'm just being told there is a link between the time when the physical body demises and all of the learning that was expected to be learned,all the experiences,all the different events and evolutionary content has been accrued,so we can demise(7/2015). Some traditions believe that each disease has its particular "spirit." Your thoughts? I don't know.I would suggest that each disease has its own particular energy,if you want to call it that,and therefore,that could be classified as "individuality."If you want to call it a "spirit,"you could do,but it wouldn't be the same type of spirit or soul that we have or animals or backfill souls have.I'd suggest it's got its own energies,its own signature,so that's probably the right way of thinking about it (7/2015). Is the disease preventable,even if you have a genetic or family predisposition to one ofthese conditions? Yes,it is preventable,always preventable,but there needs to be an unequivocal understanding of the energies associated with this problem,if it's purely a disease and not an exit strategy,for instance. If there is a potential for gaining additional evolutionary content by changing the life plan away from the potential to have this disease, then that life plan can be changed.But it takes a lot of doing to change a life plan-it's very,very hard.I've only been able to help somebody with it once or twice,but in general,it's very difficult.If the person who wants to be healed has not just faith,but the absolute feeling or knowledge that they can be healed from this particular disease,then they can be healed either by themselves or the right healer working with them(7/2015). Ifit's unavoidable,because it's in your life plan,is it possible to make it less debilitating or less severe from our human perspective? I'm told we try to do that anyway by the use of certain drugs and things, certain exercises to get the mental capacity going.But from the perspective of the aspect that's within the body,if that particular family trait is to have,for instance,Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, I'm being told that all we are allowed to do to help the soul experience a better state of beingness is try to remove their confusion or sometimes sedate them,which has other problems as well(7/2015). What causes the fear of dying? Basically,it's the ego.The ego causes the fear of dying.It tries to hang onto us and keep us in the low frequencies of human existence.The fear of dying is a function of our attraction to the physical body or the ego's need for it to be there.When we know unequivocally what we are and that we survive the physical,then there is no fear of dying.There is just joy associated with the demise process-no fear at all. It's the ego trying to make us low frequency,because the moment we start to understand what the real process is,what we really are,then we operate in a higher frequency anyway.When we operate in a higher frequency,the ego can't be maintained,because we start to communicate with our Higher Self (or TES)on a regular basis.That means that the ego itself dissolves,because we start to reintegrate the real personality of what we are into the incarnate vehicle (7/2015). What about chemicals,false foods or lack of water?Does that give the disease a foothold and can we change that? It depends upon whether the disease itself is predisposed to being "fed" by some of these things or whether the disease itself is let loose by some of the chemicals.Some of the chemicals break down the natural barriers of the body.If we're having things that are upsetting the normal status quo within the physical form,then some of these diseases can take hold,because they're turned on or the chance of them happening is being increased,because the natural defense system in the human body has been removed(7/2015). Where is our "cellular memory"held?Is it in the DNA,RNA, microtubules,magnetic field or elsewhere? The cellular memory is held in the etheric body,which is the first of seven templates we have.That's associated with the base chakra and the first auric layer.Any cellular memory we have is stored within the etheric body. If it's memory that's come down from physical ancestral memory,then that can come through the energy system as well and down into the physical.It's being passed on from the mother's and father's genome to the unborn fetus,so that gets passed down,but not genetically at first, it stays within the energies.If it isn't appropriate,then that disease isn't allowed to manifest.If it's appropriate,it is manifest,because there's a need by the soul to experience it,so it's allowed to manifest(7/2015). What happens when an organ is removed?Does the organ still exist in the etheric body,which has no effect on the physical body,since the organ is removed? Yes,it does exist in the etheric body.Any limb,muscle,sinew,bone, organ or sensory function of the body that is removed physically still has its energetic template associated with it.The basic energy system remains the same,so we don't lose an arm,if we have an arm removed. We don't lose the energy system associated with the arm. This is why people who have amputations have this ghost feeling that their arm is still there,because actually energetically it is still there. From the perspective of the physical body,the amputation might be there,but the energetic body still has it and it still functions in that way. Depending upon the way in which a limb is amputated,it predisposes it into the way it heals.I read a book about a guy working with the etheric body and etheric templates in salamanders and geckos.He could make a gecko grow more than one limb on the same limb by the way in which he amputated that limb,because it affected the etheric. For instance,if that limb was amputated and sewn up,that limb would not grow.But if a limb was amputated and just allowed to bleed normally,the body would heal itself naturally.The gecko would grow a new limb or a new tail.He hypothesized that if we had one of our fingers torn off and if we could survive the blood loss,the etheric template would intervene with the physical and we would grow or heal it back. But a lot of us think that with accidents where there's a limb lost, there's a lot of blood loss and the stress or shock associated with blood loss may well cause the demise of the human form anyway.It's only where somebody is in complete control of their body,that they could lose a limb,control the blood flow and let the stump of the limb heal naturally,so a new limb grows. It is difficult to understand,because it's all associated with how the etheric works with us and how we would work with it,if we knew how to work with it properly.It's having the unequivocal thought process that is not just belief or faith,but goes into knowledge that you can do it definitely (7/2015). What about new diseases,like Morgellon's disease?Are these manmade?Some believe it's to do with nanotechnology? There's lots of diseases that are created as a function of mutation.It is well known within the medical science and research that things do mutate.

When we think we've got one disease covered and a drug or some chemical-based therapy will keep it at bay,then there are,let's say, 100,000 versions of this disease and various different twists and turns it makes.The agent might be wiped out by a particular drug or antidote, but there's always one that isn't and then another version of it comes along.We can see this with the common cold,so every time we get a new cold,it's a new or mutated version of the cold virus that we had previously. My understanding about Morgellon's disease is that there are certain mutations that result from some genetic modification-those modifications of the virus have managed to leak outside of the sealed areas.That's causing is the virus to grow beyond its normal viral size and become almost its own animal,so to speak. This particular virus lives in the interface between the skin and the muscle where the subcutaneous fat is.It's a result of a genetic leak and you could call it manmade,if you want to,but it has become its own mutation beyond that version of a cold or a new version of the influenza or even pneumonia for that matter(7/2015). How would past life poisoning affect us in this lifetime? You would always be ill,if you had a number of lives where you carried across the energy associated with poisoning.You'd never be feeling totally well,you'd always be a sickly child or you'd have a phobia about certain foods-those foods that may have poisoned you or contained the poison,if you're poisoned by somebody. For instance,in the old days the ink used by monks or scribes to write books was poisonous.They would lick the nib of the quill with their tongue,so the ink would go into the body to poison the body.The individual would feel unwell all the time.That's the way that past life issue would be carried over(9/2015). If all lives are simultaneous in the now,how can they affect this lifetime in a sequential or parallel fashion? They don't actually,this is why they are parallel.The parallel conditions are there as a result of us having a choice.If we have a number of different parallel experiences in different event spaces that we create,then the incarnate aspect won't necessarily experience them,but the TES would do.However,there are some individuals who may be sensitive enough or have the functionality to be in contact with a parallel existence,so those parallel existences may affect their health and work here as well. I'm being told that if the TES had experienced a certain function or existence through its aspects that it wants to dissolve or terminate, then it can through one of its aspects "inject"the energies associated with a particular hangup with one of its aspects,so that the aspect with the hangup won't necessarily need to dissolve it or remove that karmic link themselves,because it could be done by the TES by using another projected aspect to dissolve the link. I'm being told that those aspects that remain projected,because they are doing a number of different or back-to-back incarnations are the ones that carry across issues from one life to another life.They may try to remove that link by going through the incarnation process. These links with the past lives that get carried across from life to life are a karmic function,so they need to be dealt with in the physical, because it's not something that we can do in the energetic.We need to be exposed to it again,and therefore,correct that issue whilst in the physical.We do incarnate again just to remove karmic influence,some of which are the links between past lives(9/2015). Why didn't America's indigenous population suffer from any diseases or epidemics that were so rampant in Europe (chickenpox, plague,syphilis,influenza,etc.)? That was because they were at a higher frequency.The American Indian,the native Indians and the aborigines in Australia and other areas of the world,such as the Maoris in NZ,were all fairly pure and for the most part untouched by the addictions and attractions to being incarnate.They understood who and what they were and worked with the energies associated with the natural environment. They were higher frequency-much too high frequency-to have their physical forms affected by diseases that were created through energetic disharmony,so they never caught those things.It was only when they were introduced to lower frequency existence and foods, practices,drinks that they started to come down the frequencies. Then their physical forms started to be affected by some of these energies,such as chickenpox,plague,syphilis,influenza,pneumonia, TB,leprosy,etc.That came later when they were pulled down the frequencies by other people of lower frequency who were starting to explore and repopulate the Earth(1/2016). Chronic inflammation is thought to be the root cause of many chronic illnesses,such as heart disease,cancers and dementia.Inflammation is caused by stress,a poor diet,lack of exercise and exposure to toxins.We can make lifestyle changes (e.g.anti-inflammatory diet, fasting,exercise,stress relief,adequate sleep).What can we do from the energetic side? Some instances of dementia,whether it's Alzheimer's,Parkinson's or other versions can be associated with one's life plan-the desire to experience different levels of sentient function or conscious function. Sometimes the soul is gradually detaching itself from the incarnation whilst still maintaining some level of connectivity.Their body may appear to function properly,because they can still animate the body, but from a consciousness perspective,it's like logging into previous experiences achieved either minutes ago or years ago.Eventually,this detachment of the soul allows the body to demise and the soul moves back into the energetic. A lot of it has to do with the lifestyle-not psychological issues, although stress can create levels of what we call dementia or loss of memory.That's due to just trying to do too much stuff.We can all experience that and so we have to write things down,which is good practice actually.But the other side of it is the foods we're having. I've said this many times-if you look back about 40 years on TV or films,a lot of the actors are thin.They're thin,because they're eating whole food,which they've bought from a green grocer,butcher,fruit shop.It hasn't been treated with pesticides,preserved or pre-prepared. We made meals ourselves from raw ingredients. When we start to eat prepared foods or meals from supermarkets,the preservatives and fats in them are a level of poison.They create disharmony within the body.The fats are more easily absorbed and a bit addictive to the body.We use natural fats as part of the brain that acts as a cognitive vehicle.When we exercise,the body naturally uses the good fats to exercise,but leaves the bad fats there,so we have difficulty losing fat. All these fats or different types of cholesterol are used by the brain at a higher level to assist in the connectivity between the sentience (in the soul seat)and that associated with the human form.We get an inability to connect from a physical perspective to our energetic perspective, because it's dysfunctional.The energies associated with it are not in harmony with us.The preserved foods,supplements or medication we're taking create a disharmony energetically and results in a lack of sentient functionality or consciousness from the physical perspective. We have to go back to basics with foods and remove stress,remove pre- prepared foods and make your own foods by going back to cooking properly or eating raw food,such as raw vegetables and raw fruits. Moving away from doing too much work,getting regular sleep and regular exercise as well.There's a whole bunch of different things,but the big one is to move away from pre-prepared and preserved foods (11/2018). Is it possible to modify the expression of these conditions through some energetic means,like the meditation you gave us to heal any organ or body part? Yes,I feel that it can be changed by using Psycho-Spiritual Programming to change the function of the gene at the RNA level, because RNA energetically programs the DNA to function or not. Psycho-spiritual healing and programming is something that Source has allowed me to develop,as explained in my book called Psycho- Spiritual Healing(11/2018). In my experience with family and friends with Alzheimer's disease or dementia,it seems to happen closer toward their end of life or in the last 5-8 years oflife? Yes,this is because the soul is departing.It's moving away,and therefore,the sentience associated with the human form to animate it is reducing(7/2019). Dementia has the effect of scrambling time,so the person can't distinguish past/present/future.Do they have a breakdown in the barrier of chronological time?Do they experience all happening concurrently and simultaneously? Yes,that's true,because when the soul comes back into the body,they are working on a superconscious level,so to speak.They're almost back into their normal energetic state where they exist,so they get mixed up,because time doesn't exist for us in real terms.Coming back into a chronologically based environment where things are not being parallelized or everything is not happening concurrently,then having to separate them out is particularly difficult(7/2019). Is dementia a dissolving of the barrier between the physical reality and the greater reality?If so,is this to prepare the aspect for transitioning out ofthe human vessel?

It is happening,because the aspect is mostly out of the human vehicle It is experiencing existence as it normally does,which is an instantaneous and concurrent and simultaneous way.That includes everything that has existed-whether it will be existing,could exist, should exist and might exist and has existed.Being in that environment and then coming back to this physical where everything is in a linear way is quite confusing. Because one is working in this normally concurrent situation, everything's that happened has already happened.There's no anchor point between what happened last week compared to what happened three years ago,compared to what's going to happen today or in three seconds'time,for instance.It's difficult for the individual who is experiencing dementia or Alzheimer's to relate to this linear way of existing,because the soul exists in the state of beingness that is instantaneous and concurrent (7/2019). What is the emotional cause ofrheumatoid arthritis and how can we heal it?Is it more difficult to heal it once it has physically manifested? Arthritis is simply to do with resistance to being in the physical.That's what I've just been told.If you look at it from a completely physical perspective,it's almost rigor mortis.The physical body is in stasis or wants to be in stasis,because we don't want to be here.Any form of arthritis is about not wanting to be here,because it's too hard and wanting to leave.This wanting to leave means we don't want to animate the body. The way to heal it is to embrace being here and embrace the environment that we're in giving thanks to being able to use this environment and our interaction with others to enable us to progress from an evolutionary perspective.From that position you should be able to accept being incarnate and start to animate the body again. That's what I'm being told as a piece of instantaneously channeled information.It makes sense,so try that.Just try to embrace being in the physical,try to embrace wanting to be here and interact physically. You'll find that the body animates itself more and you start to remove this stickiness or the body's desire to go into stasis(7/2019) I felt painful energetically and physically when I had physical contact or communication with someone with dementia and schizophrenia.It felt like being exposed to unbearable noise.Is this the energetic signature of dementia or schizophrenia patient? Basically,dementia is a function of the soul starting to leave the body in a slow way.You start to feel a disharmony in the energy associated with that,because the soul isn't totally integrated.You can tell that,because the memory sets aren't there.The recognition ofloved ones isn't there. The understanding of who and what they are and where they are isn't there as well.But they still function,so there's still enough sentience there in the body and energy to animate the body.There's a disharmony between the fully functioning,fully immersed soul or aspect within the incarnate human vehicle that it's working with to be able to experience,learn and evolve in this environment. Schlzoo/renta is a different thing.If there's more than one soul in the body,then they may have difficulty in dealing with which soul is animating the body and which soul is just passively observing,not interacting.But the other souls may want to interact as well,so you start to see an issue with the harmony of the energies. There should be one soul animating the body unless it's an agreement that one soul will come in and another will go out.Sometimes the souls have a collective understanding that they will work together or take turns.Some people with more than one soul work perfectly well, because they're using a collective response,which appears to be a singular level of sentience. But if each of those souls wants to have a go,then there's a disharmonious energy there,because they're trying to fight each other to animate the body.This is when you start to see that the person you're observing will start to talk to what appears to be nothing or nobody. Their personality will change and they'll be observing different things that aren't available to us in this physical environment (FB 1-3).The energetic disharmony is associated with the soul leaving the body or a number of souls fighting for supremacy.That causes the disharmony, which is difficult for somebody who is sensitive to the energies (9/2020). How could a person that seemed to have no signs of schizophrenia develop it later in their life?What's happening to them on the soul level? They may have left themselves very open to uninvited souls who are looking to get some experience of being incarnate on this level.They use this openness as a way in.It could be a soul who hasn't made its way back into the energetic yet,because it's addicted to being on Earth. These souls look for individuals who are very open with no energetic defenses,so they can walk-in. That gives the appearance of somebody suddenly flipping,losing control,having a melt down and changing their personality overnight. The person may appear to be talking to themselves,when they're communicating with something that other people around them can't see.Sometimes a walk-in is planned and they can also change the person overnight,but that change becomes acceptable. Sometimes the person may want to communicate with astral entities. These entities are being given free rein to communicate and/or animate the body in some way.If the astral entities have been in existence a long time,they can mimic the way humans think,behave and act.They give the appearance of the individual being under normal sort of control.So if they've been open,these things can come and go (9/2020). You said that people with dementia have completed their life plan and expectations,so there is no need for them to be incarnate.The soul is gradually departing,but may be staying longer for its family members-unless they allow the soul to leave.Can we ask them to set another goal(life plan)and extend the reason for being here? It's not normal for somebody with dementia who is on their way out of incarnation to come back,because they're choosing that way to exit. They're choosing the gradual decrease in their cognition to make their loved ones or those working with them to come to various levels of gradual acceptance that they can no longer count on them being there. It's unlikely that a new life plan would be created,because that soul would be excited about leaving this incarnation and going back to their normal energetic state again(9/2020). Ifthey agree to extend their incarnation,are we able to heal their body to help them recover from dementia? There are souls who have near death expertences where they experience the choice for them to stay or go.That's where they have a termination juncture (exit point).It's a chance to say,"Okay,I can go and it's not going to cause any downstream evolutionary issues.Or I can stay if I need to,and then it's like working overtime."You've got an extra level of opportunity to experience,learn and evolve in this incarnation, which may be of benefit. Sometimes people will come back to extreme circumstances or from an operation in hospital.They may have some form of memory loss associated with an accident or something,when they come back.In these cases the body is usually in good condition or there's a termination juncture to choose if you want to stay or go. I'm being told it doesn't happen with dementia,they don't stay.The soul has decided it's going and it's already on its way with its cognition being removed quite quickly.The sentient energy associated with animating the body is probably the last thing to go,because they can still move around. It's just that their cognition about being here is very,very limited. They'll go down past 10%of what they previously were.They can still animate the body,but it's like an automaton until there's a focus that brings them around,"Oh,that's such and such,that's my son."They come into sharp focus for a moment until they realize that now the son knows I'm here.I don't need to be here anymore. Individuals with Alzheimers or dementia may slow down the process a bit,if medical research has decided to give them some cocktail of drugs that suddenly assists the brain by creating or rebuilding neural networks.But you have to understand that the sentience or the cognition of an individual isn't the brain.That's just a function that is part of the body. The sentience isn't the brain,so trying to create something,which repairs the brain in the long term isn't going to solve dementia or things like Alzheimer's or even Parkinson's disease(9/2020). Are allergies caused by traumas? They are usually caused by past life traumas that come through from our previous incarnations that we've hung onto.For instance,if we had a particularly difficult transition (death)or certain experiences that we've had difficulty in shifting or detaching from,then they can come through as a level of resistance to experience and that can cause allergies. It's the same thing for being frightened by spiders or snakes or animals. We may have been bitten by a snake and died.We may have been bitten by a dog and got rabies and died. These are the things that could cause us to have certain allergies or fears.It's how we departed from previous incarnations or experienced certain things that we'd rather not experience in other incarnations. But they have nevertheless contributed towards our evolutionary progression(6/2021).

### Dreams 

What we call a "dream"is a translation ofwhat the soul experiences while the body is asleep.Our soul wanders to the astral plane at night when our body rests. What are the myriad functions that dreams provide for humans and non-human animals?How can we understand the information being presented to us in dreams? Dreams are when the sentience moves out of the gross physical and the spirituo-physical side of the human vehicle and experiences the frequencies associated with the astral levels or they move beyond this universe.Dreams come in three conditions. The first condition is when there's information being given to us by our guide and helpers,which is using imagery,words or some symbolic method of communication.The second condition is when we're experiencing an Earth based environment but at a higher frequency, usually the astral levels (FB 4-7).We can also move out into different planets or galaxies. The third part is where we experience the movement of our sentience outside of the physical universe and go into the higher universes.Our interpretation or "translation"of the imagery or any form of communication is based upon our total experience in astral traveling and projection of consciousness beyond this universe with our guide and helpers trying to help us with symbology.It may be perceived as a white out (or black out),if we have no human description for the things we experience(12/2016). Dreams are a medium of communication.A dream journal or dream dictionary can help.What are some other ways to cultivate the understanding ofthe communications? A universal dictionary of dream meanings can only be a generalization. The detail is based upon the individual's experiential vocabulary and what these different experiences mean to them,so it can only ever be individualized. There can be general stuff,but it's definitely personalized We need to use dreams for what they are,which is a communicative medium or an experiential medium and recognize them as an opportunity for information either for ourselves or a wider group of individuals.We can identify the standard response-in general,this information means this,but what does it mean for you?Search into yourself. What does this image or that animal mean to you?What does that response with a loved one mean to you?What does that response to a person in your job or career role mean to you? The way forwards is to create your own dream dictionary.If people start to use their interactions during the sleep state and recognize who and what they are based upon the communication with their guide and helpers,their experience in the astral levels and other parts of the physical universe and the rest of the multiverse,then they will generate a level of understanding of who and what we are.We are a much bigger entity than we think we are.It will give us a wider understanding as well(12/2016). When our pets are dreaming,vocalizing,moving their limbs as if running and such,where do they go?Is it the astrallevels(FB 4-7)? We do astral traveling and so do our animal friends as well.They can go to the astral levels,which are levels 4-7 or they can simply be not going anywhere and the body is twitching as a result of just randomized neurons dancing around the brain. There are times when the physical body does try to mirror the movements and actions that the animals are experiencing whilst the soul leaves the body.Depending upon how good the link is determines how much feedback the body gives in terms of copying what's being experienced.Basically,it could be anywhere.It could be astral levels or it could be upper locations within the physical universe,if they have a role to do there as well(9/2017). What is the purpose of dreaming for animals?Do they process their daily experiences in the dream state? Dreams are really just translations of what we're experiencing when our sentience or our soul is outside of the body.There is no such thing as "dreaming"as such,it's basically some form of translation of what we've experienced.Sometimes we have no dreams.Sometimes we have really bizarre dreams.Sometimes we have really understandable dreams. We call them "dreams,"but they're basically interpretations or translations of what's being experienced by the soul whilst the body is sleeping.That's the same thing for all incarnate entities-whether it's animals or human beings(9/2017). Or is it another level of experience for their soul extensions?They seem so animated. Basically,it's the same thing.Their physical body is mirroring what's being experienced,because the link is there.It's like an autonomous, unwitting response that's happening,because there is still communication between the soul and the body.The body is animating itself simply because it's doing something that is similar to that which is being experienced by the soul in a different environment whilst the body is asleep(9/2017). What is the role of the entities causing nightmares?Are they attracted to traumas of people?What is the point of changing dreams into horror? Nightmares are when we astral travel out of the body,but not very far. We go up to the next level in frequency and start interacting with individuals who are also astral traveling-including lower astral entities and individual aspects that are no longer incarnate but can't disassociate themselves from the human condition or the Earth They're not really nightmares as such,but interactions with others on the fourth frequency level in an astral traveling condition.That environment is sometimes is nice and sometimes not so nice Sometimes we attract astral entities that feed on our fears and present themselves in a way which we are fearful of,so that we don't interact with them in a way that destroys them.If we interact with them in a high frequency way,then they can't exist with us.They tend to dissolve back into Source.But if we're fearful of them,they maintain their individuality and they can still use that to feed off us as well. Occasionally,a guide or helpers will infuse a level of connectivity with us to make us move away from a certain decision point.One of the ways they could do it is by frightening us away from the decision that we shouldn't make to another decision.Although they don't like to frighten us,sometimes they have to use very direct means to make us change direction,which could be classified as being horrible or nightmarish(8/2019).

### Event Space (Parallelism) 

Time doesn't exist-what exists is Event Space where all events happen simultaneously.This refers to parallelism or temporary parallel environments that are activated by the intention of an entity who has a choice to make.Event space knows how to manipulate energies and frequencies within it to copy conditions to explore more than one scenario. What happens when we go down the path ofleast resistance? By choosing to go down the path of least resistance,we limit the number of permutations of event space that could possibly be created as a result of us fighting that path ofleast resistance.This is the beauty of our levels of creativity that we have.We can choose to go down the path of least resistance,and therefore,have a more seamless journey in our experience,learning,and therefore,evolutionary content. If we fight against it,we try to do this,that and the other,then we start to split off aspects of ourselves and do that which we're trying to do in various different ways.That creates the multiple event spaces. We would in our incarnate state only recognize that which is the main event space.We wouldn't recognize the other parts,although we might start to get information and thinking it's intuition.That results from that aspect of us that's split off into another event space.Maybe it's in an event space that ends,so we've learned from that in some way,shape or form. We say,"Okay,we shouldn't have gone that route,because this would have happened."We're not clever enough to recognize that some parallel aspect of ourselves has gone down that route,experienced that dead end and that's fed back to us.That aspect of us has come back to ourselves with full knowledge that that particular direction was a dead end. Every time we go down a certain path,which is resisted,but we still do it,there's still resistance or worry.We'll justify it later,because you'll suddenly get this thing pop into your head,"Oh,that would have happened,if I had gone down that route,good that I went down this route instead."Those sort of things happen. That's what makes us recognize that we're going down the path ofleast resistance when that aspect of us comes back into us,albeit in an intuitive way.For instance,if we had gone down that route,maybe you'd have flipped the car and broken a leg.But you didn't,so the thought process could come into your mind,"I'm glad I didn't do that, because that happened." That's the sort of information that comes back,when we've been experiencing different event spaces.The main line of us is still going down the path of least resistance,but at some point,maybe there was an argument within ourselves where that choice could have been made (9/2012). So the path of least resistance limits the number of event spaces that we create? Yes.How do we choose the most beneficial route or one which doesn't create more karma?Event space happens concurrently.Everything happens at the same time,so we can in effect live a whole life and have that information fed back to us within an hour or a second,as an example,and then still go down the path of least resistance knowing that we're going in a certain direction. We do get feedback from event spaces that play it out totally and then we subconsciously act upon that information.We consider it as not being given by our guides or helpers,but we classify it as intuition or a gut instinct.There are times when information is given to us by our guides to make sure that we do certain things at the right time,but even that information may well be given to them based upon this other "what if scenario"that's been played out in totality through event space The guides have registered it and say,"You don't actually want to go that way."It's all happening concurrently,except that our main guide and our helpers are more able to log into that part of event space than we are,because they are fully in the energetic,whereas we are in the physical,so we don't have the bandwidth to access that information (9/2012). What is the difference between simultaneous life parallelism vs. event space parallelism? In my understanding,we exist within the multiverse and our True Energetic Self can put up to 12 aspects into various parts of that multiverse to experience it in different ways.Our TES projects the aspects or souls.The soul can also project up to 12 shards.That means it's possible to have 144 different aspects of ourselves experiencing simultaneousexistences somewhere in the multiverse. When we're talking about the multiverse itself,these are simultaneous existences rather than parallel existences.They are individualized but static existences that are simultaneous in the sense,that we have a limitation as to how many parts of ourselves we can project into this multiverse.That limitation is a total of 144 parts (or 12 aspects x 12 shards). A parallelcondition is different,because it is created wherever we have a choice to make.That's where event space comes into it.We can split ourselves into parallel selves to explore different parallel conditions. The number of parallel conditions depends on how many choices we have to make.They include localized event spaces that pertain to us or anybody else making a choice individually and group event spaces that can be created within any of the universes within the multiverse.There are quite a lot of localized and group environments that are parallel conditions created by event space(5/2014). You said that event space is used by entities to learn about the cause and effect of things.Does that mean all karma is being created and resolved in event space that is overseen by an aspect in a spherical or holistic way? Yes,basically.We're creating lots of event spaces,because we all have different choices to make,such as the choice to go out today,to see friends or go to a party,etc.All these different things come into play. All the karma that is associated with those individualized event spaces that are created as a result of our choices results in karma in those areas as well.All of this is being experienced concurrently by the True Energetic Self,because the TES is in a different energetic space where it can experience all of it at the same time.Even though we experience only one environment and we think this is the main stream event space,which it might not be,our TES can experience all of it concurrently. Based on that,it is possible for an aspect to have,for example,3127 different event spaces,so they are experiencing 3127 different lives for a period of time until they all converge.Each of those 3127 parallel versions of that aspect would be experiencing them in an individual sense without knowledge of the others,but the TES would experience all 3127 existences at the same time. The karmic link is only tied to those entities that are within the physical universe,not those outside of it,because karma only occurs in the physical universe.Karma is not a function of the rest of the multiverse. We only accrue karma through being in the physical universe,because karma is attachment or addiction to anything that is associated with the physical universe.The desire or need to come back to the physical universe to sort out various things (e.g.low frequency thoughts, behaviors,actions,interactions,attachments or addictions)are the very basic cause and effect structure of karma(5/2014). Is the physical universe like one big event space with no hard structure,since it will collapse when we ascend to FB 13-14?Do other dimensions also collapse,as entities ascend out ofthem? It's not one big event space.It's a solid structure,a static part of the multiverse.It's not actually going to collapse.It will still be there when we no longer need to incarnate at the frequencies associated with the physical universe(FB 1-12).It's just that we won't use it. It will be pretty much closed off to us,because it won't be necessary for us to use it.The other dimensions won't collapse either,because the structure of the multiverse stays there.There is no collapsing of our multiverse at all.The only time it could collapse is if Source decided to recreate it,which happens at the end of a multiverse cycle(5/2014). It is said that we create our own reality.But what happens at night while we're asleep?Who maintains the reality of the bed,house, physical body,etc.?Do we blink it into existence in the morning? Basically,there are enough individuals who we are interfacing with whilst we are incarnate,who expect us to be here.They're also creating a reality,so they help to maintain the perpetuation of this reality,when we are no longer focused on it.On top of that,there is like an autopilot function of us,which is still focused on maintaining the reality around us even when the body goes to sleep and the soul travels around the world or local physical universe and does other things. There's two things happening:first,the automatic function that allows the perpetual creativity of our localized environment,including our physical form and maintains its existence,and secondly,the existence is maintained by others who are expecting us to be here.We're all smaller individualized units of a large memory bank,which is making this all happen and stay in a reality. If we all,for instance,decided to remove that automatic function or we all decided that we didn't want to have this particular environment or reality,it would in fact wink out of existence.We maintain it automatically whilst we are doing other things and others around us also help to maintain it as well,because they want us and the environment that we exist in to be here,because they also use it (6/2015). The Essence of Events represents the substructure of Event Spaces. What are the main forces/actions or energies that exist at its core? How do they interact when a new possible possibility becomes apparent to create a primary perturbation in the initial environment? I'm just being told,it's created through disturbance.Event space is essentially a pure condition where everything is in a state of perfection. It's only when things have the possibility of becoming a state of imperfection that event space creates another event space. So it's this disturbance,lack of a homogenous condition,lack of harmony that allows the event space to go from one total event space- that is everywhere as a singular state of environment or state of everything happening concurrently-to a separate potential over there,to move it to one side and create another version of itself. So it's like a frustration,like a frustrated state of alack of homogenous space.It is a resistance created through a changing condition.It's a ripple effect or a disturbance,like somebody putting their finger in a bucket of water (4/2016). So all our parallel selves are imperfect and frustrated? And so are we here from that perspective.Duality is an existence that results from being in the physical universe.In essence,everything is in perfection-even though it's imperfect,it is perfect. When there is a ripple effect or a disturbance to that level of perfection, then we get the creation of duality,triality,quadruality or duality to the power of N.Then we start to get change,where the forces and actions that create this essence of events or changes.It can either create a compression of events into one event or dissolution of that compression of events that creates a singular event into multiple events.It's easy to see,but difficult to explain in human terms. In essence,it really is like a frustration-that's the best way I can say it. It's a frustration in the order of the essence of all events existing in a coherent,corroborated and instantaneously happening thing. Everything happens concurrently,so when concurrence is affected,we start to get this change where the essence of events can move from being homogenous to being inharmonious. You could call it moving outside the vortex of energy,but it's almost as if the boat is moving with the natural flow of the river,then you'll get no bow wave.But when you want the boat to move away from the flow -either to go faster,go against the flow,go to the left or to the right, then you create a bow wave,so then you create a different condition to that which is homogenous. If you go with the flow,if everything goes with the flow,then we don't get any changes,we don't get any different event spaces,so the essence of events is maintained as a singular homogenous,all-encompassing event rather than a series of events,which are the possibilities or the possibilities of the possibility of,or the possible possibilities of the possible possibilities of additional directions,methods,ways or potentials.I can see it in my mind's eye,but it's difficult to put down into words(4/2016). Isn't our evolution based on multiple event spaces to explore? In human terms,we think of everything in a linear fashion,so we expect events follow each other.There is a start of an event and an end of an event.The start of the event links in with the end of another event,but it's not true.Everything is or everything exists concurrently. In reality,there is no start and end of an event,it is just an event.Events are there-the event is the event,events are part of the event. Everything happens concurrently and everything is instantaneous,so there is no start and finishing an event.It's just all essence of events and those events are an event.So there's no beginning and end there, it's just there. But the interaction with those events,that causes a change to the concurrency of the overall event or essence of events causes this ripple effect or this disturbance,which creates the need for additional event spaces to cope with that disturbance from the homogenous essence of events that was in existence(4/2016). Is that a quantum effect? It's a very poor way of describing it at best.A quantum effect is like saying,"Can you explain higher THOR mathematics with 1+1?"The answer is no,you can't,but somebody might be able to. The quantum effect is something where mankind is trying to understand how things can happen,if we observe them or not observe them.But the observation function is something that has only been relatively understood.For instance,Schroedinger's cat is another one, isn't it?It either is or it isn't or it is and it isn't at the same time.That's the same thing,like the cat in Alice in Wonderland where it's always stating that it's there but it isn't(4/2016). Or a wave vs.a particle? The wave is the particle,the particle is the wave.It just depends on how it feels and whether it represents itself as a particle or a wave.But if it can represent itself as a particle or a wave,then what is it in real terms? It's part of the essence of everything.It could be that the event changes it to be a particle or a wave (4/2016). Does it depend on whether it's observed or not? No,I think the observation is simply a little nudge in the right direction that we're getting to think of it in a different way.That's just a milestone (4/2016). Like a feeling? Yes,it could be a feeling,but it could be a whole bunch of other things that we haven't gotten an idea about in terms of how we can sense things(4/2016). I have some questions about invoking Event Space at different levels: local galactic beyond to multiversal event spaces.You mentioned parallel existences arose from many different degrees of invoking event space.Are multiple event spaces created when we allow our thoughts to create additional narratives/options when we face a major choice in life?How complete will the experience be by the parallelization? If we are making a choice based upon a thought process and we physically go out there and make that choice,then the answer is yes, we do create a new event space.But because we are individualized in the incarnate state,we can't perceive these parallelized conditions.Or can we? When I was in India,one of the people in my workshops had a family member who was experiencing parallel conditions.He was thinking that he was in one location and friends were saying he was doing something else.We eventually found out that he was uncontrollably flicking his consciousness between three different locations where three different versions of himself were experiencing three different things. He didn't have an anchor point to any particular reality,so he was moving around without even knowing it.That was causing problems, because he was sure things were happening or he had done something and actually he hadn't,he had done something else. In general,we don't experience these other locations or event spaces, these other parallel conditions,because we are anchored into our particular reality.This part of our sentience that is associated with our soul stays with the parallelized conditions.So when we get parallelized off to experience a new event space or a new parallel reality,that experience is fully experienced without any interaction with one of the other parallelizations,because that simply causes confusion(7/2016). What purpose do these parallels serve?I presume that the individual human is not the only recipient oftheir function,as we are part ofthe bigger picture.Do they serve some type of structural support function?Can you elaborate on this line of thinking? Parallel conditions are a function of Event Space full stop.Event Space creates parallel conditions through the possibility of change or opportunity for decision-decision A vs.decision B or C or D or E or F, etc. If we have a decision to make,we have the potential and do create another event space where a part of us separates out and experiences that alternative and the fractals from that alternative.It's a natural function of the multiverse,because Event Space is a natural function of the Origin.Event Space permeates or pervades the Origin,and therefore,it pervades the Source,and therefore,it pervades us.It pervades everything. It's something that's a natural function.From our soul's perspective or from our True Energetic Self's perspective,even that of the Source Entities and the Origin,Event Space serves a unique function insomuch as it allows the multiple and concurrent expression of experience based upon the fractal possibilities of different directions to go in. These things can grow fractally and collapse fractally as well.We can start off with a single event space for ourselves and the event stream associated with that and then through fractalization get thousands or tens of thousands other event streams to experience.If it goes to an evolutionary dead end,it can shrink back into a smaller number of event spaces,which is what happens at the very end of our incarnation (7/2016).

Which event space are we in?Is this event space the primary event space,the main line event space? It doesn't matter.We have to concentrate on the event space that we're working on right now.We have to work with who and what we are and what we're doing right now.To try to think about where we could be and what else is happening would only confuse us and stop us from operating effectively in this particular event space(7/2016). What is it about the structure of the multiverse that requires these parallels and multiple event spaces to get formed? It's basically choice.When we are in an individualized condition where we are in a position to make choice,it's not so much the multiverse that requires or allows these event spaces to get formed,it's Event Space itself.Event Space is an integral but covert function of everything. So it's not about what is it about the structure of the multiverse that requires these parallels and multiple event spaces to get formed,it's everything about the multiverse,everything about the local universe. If you think about a local environment,it gets changed,everything is duplicated.Sometimes it's duplicated,but also integrated with the previous event space It's not that we get duplication of everything,there is overlap as well, because other event spaces are localized to ourselves and micro-event spaces.Then there are galactic,global or country-sized or universe-size event spaces that also overlap each other,because they all work with each other.They all connect with each other. In The Curators there are a lot entities that work with event space and have the ability to manipulate event space in some way,shape or form and modify event space,which I found interesting,because it means that we don't really have what we would call "total free will."There is always some level of guidance or intervention going on to make sure that we're doing the right things or getting close to doing the right things.I was quite surprised at that.Basically,everything that is is interjoined. When I looked at the fractalization of a particular point in event space, it could fractalize out like a 3-D effect-a little bit like multiple trees all joined at the roots and springing out,or like a puff ball or a dandelion seed head,but much more fractalized than that.At each termination point or the end of the seed head or the furry bit that acts like a parachute,there's another possibility of another tree or fractalization, so everything is outwards and inwards as well.Every part of the multiverse is affected by event space,but it can also be localized as well (7/2016). What limits are there on the parallels,other than a reference to the intensity that is vibrationally creating it? There are no limits.The only limits are us in terms of what we create and when it naturally demises.The limit is not based upon how many event spaces can be created,but how many can be supported by the evolutionary function associated with that particular event space being created. When we get to an evolutionary dead end,that event space starts to collapse back down or get close to a different fractalization of the main event space,so you could classify that part as being a limitation to that particular fractalized function of event space.But there isn't a real quantifiable metric for the number of parallel conditions that can be created-only that the parallel conditions do die off when there is an evolutionary dead end(7/2016). It seems the 'name of the game'as a human is to take risks and be open to change.More options equals more event spaces equals more evolutionary content and more rapid soul advancement through experience? I wouldn't say that it's about taking risks.It's about taking the opportunities that present themselves to us.If that's classified as a risk, then fair enough.But it's more about taking life by the horns,so to speak,and not being shy or dropping out of our responsibility to experience as a result of what's put in front of us. Certainly,there are things that we get exposed to that we want to back away from.For instance,sometimes those things put the gross physical body at risk.If there is a life plan where that gross physical body needs to be in existence for another 30-40 years,then putting it in a position where it's got a very high percentage of demising is not a good idea, because that is not really an act that helps the gross physical form (7/2016). Modern society breeds a desire for stability over change using fear as a tool. It's not about taking risks or being really conservative and stopping change,it's about taking the responsibility for experiencing that which is presented to us,when it's presented to us,and being grateful for the experience-even if it's something like being caught for speeding or going down the freeway with only a gallon of petrol and experiencing the car breaking down,because it's got no fuel. These sorts of things happen,because they happen,although we can plan for them not to happen as well.We don't have to speed and we have to make sure that our car is full of gasoline.Basically,it's not about being risk-averse,it's about taking the opportunities as they present themselves.It's about taking the opportunities and working with them,if they feel right.That's the most important thing.If they feel right,then that is the ticket that says this is a good experience to have(7/2016). Can there be too many options or forks in the road to choose from, thus creating too many event spaces and parallels?At what point are too many potential parallels a drain on the TES or the resources of the Source where efficiency of evolutionary accrual becomes your limiting factor? No,there aren't too many options,because each option is an option. Each option is a potential for experiencing,learning and evolving and the efficiency associated with that.We don't lose efficiency as a result of an increase in the number of parallel conditions or event spaces that are created,we actually gain efficiency.The more things that we can experience in a parallelized condition or concurrent condition at any point in our existence,the more efficient we are in gaining evolutionary content(7/2016). Or is it totally separate where one is able to create fewer parallels, because they limit their thinking to focus on only one outcome? There is no limitation on how many options or parallels or forks that can be taken-it's just our own ability to deal with them-knowing that all of this stuff happens automatically anyway in terms of the splitting off of event spaces,because Event Space does it and creates it. It's not something that we have to think about,although some of those entities that work with the maintenance of the multiverse sometimes have to make some changes to event space,if it's not considered to be evolutionarily efficient.But that's something for The Curators,so I'll leave you waiting with bated breath on that one(7/2016). How exactly does one "move into"an event space?Is this like joining a volunteer group to be of service?If so,how is that activity joining an event space?Are we ever aware that we're consciously moving into an event space?Or is it an accident oflife choices we make? Event space is a bit like realities or parallel conditions.We generally have a number of choices to make in our daily,monthly and yearly existence.Depending upon the influences around us,we either make a decision,which is based upon going in one particular direction,a mainstream direction or another direction.That gives you just three choices.But sometimes we have twelve choices or two choices. Moving into an event space is something that happens as a result of our choices and our decision processes,when we have a decision to make. We can move into a new event space or we can continue to move in the existing event stream within the event space. Event streams are described in The Curators.It's very difficult for us as human beings to actively know that we're moving into a different event space.If we have a decision to make and we make a decision,then we may not experience anything specific or dramatic,but we will know that we've moved either into a new event space that is relevant to that decision process or we've decided to stay in the existing event stream, and therefore,we're continuing on along the same line.So it's to do with those decision processes. If we were an entity,like a Curator,that is working on the maintenance of the multiversal environment,then we can move into event space by choosing an event that is parallel to or linked with the start of an event, but our end of event needs to be compatible with the start of event in the next event space.There has to be a link between them. This is something that the Curators do.They manipulate event space in various different realities to ensure that evolutionary efficiency is maintained.They have to work with individuals who are working within a particular event space and event stream in a way that links the end of event in one event space and the beginning event in a new event space in a sort of linear fashion,so that they're compatible with each other. A conscious move would only be achievable for us,if we were a Curator,a maintenance entity.The only way we know that we're moving into a different event space is if something dramatic happens where we change direction dramatically.Then we know we've moved into a different event space,because it's not where we expected to go.If it's not where we expected to go,then that's the sign that says you've moved into a new event space(11/2017).

Kevin Moore interviewed a channel who allowed him to interview one of his parallel selves.This "parallel Kevin"was gay and exists in a parallel reality,which woke up centuries ago and exists at a different frequency.Kevin asked what is different in that parallel world? Parallel Kevin said they don't use money,but they have trade for whateveran entity needs.They are not a technological world,which is an easy world to live on,because everything is done for you and everything is free.But there is truly no waking up in that world.They channel ideas for other galactic species that are awakening and ascending.But they themselves are not on the path of ascension,like our world is.Their parallel world will die,when no one is energizing the idea any longer. They just walk away and go onto other things. Previously,you told us that evolution is experiential and that everything is only a parallel condition to something else.If it can be experienced and it can be experienced in different ways,it should be experienced in all those different ways. That's right and that's a continuous piece of information that gets told to me on a regular basis and is throughout the new book called The Curato5(1/2018). This brings up questions about the degree of diversification in our parallel incarnations.Do most souls explore different gender orientations as parallel selves(gay,bisexual,transgender,etc.)?Or is it just some souls who choose to do that in the human form? Outside of the parallel conditions,we all experience all those different gender orientations anyway.It's part of our complete experiential set of things that we do.We're all ladies,we're all gentlemen-this is coming from an Earth perspective by the way.We're gay,bisexual, transgender.We're also rich or abjectly poor.We're beggars.We're architects.We're kings.We're sailors.We have to experience every potential opportunity that is available to us in this particular condition. Now I'm going to spit off to the difference between parallel conditions and reality,because "reality"is something we create within an event space.Event space is an environment within a space that allows us to experience a set of experiences and interactions with other individuals who are also experiencing their experiences within a set environment. To answer the question,this happens anyway even in our current event space and in other lives.It is reasonable to assume that we may well do that in other parallel conditions as well.But it's more likely that we'll experience different event streamsrather than gender opportunities. For instance,we will be experiencing failing an exam vs.passing an exam,missing a bus vs.taking the bus,being on a plane that's crashing vs.being on a plane that doesn't crash.These are different things that we would experience as part of our parallel opportunities rather than just the gender opportunities there. Don't forget that a parallel condition or event space is created through choices or decisions based upon those choices,the possibility of having that choice,the possible possibility of having a choice or the possibility of possible possibilities of having a choice.It's a fractalized and complicated thing to consider when we talk about which particular event space or parallel condition we move down(1/2018).

Does a technological world represent a branch off the mainline life path,which goes off into a dead end or collapses into the trunk at some point? It expands into a reasonable event space and the event stream associated with it.Then at some point it contracts back into the mainstream or the trunk of the main event space(1/2018). Is it done just to get that experience(more evolutionary content),not for ascension opportunities? Everything that we experience from the mainline event space and the parallelized event spaces (and the various fractal conditions associated with that)are all available for us to use for our evolutionary progression,and therefore,ascension.Everything that we experience, even if we won't experience it ourselves (as humans),but our True Energetic Self will experience what a "parallel Guy"or 200 or several hundred parallel Guys are experiencing,because a different decision was made. For instance,if I went to live in Germany rather than the UK or didn't decide to stop working and start to do this work,there's all versions of me that didn't do something or did do something or did something else further on down the line and chose some other path.The True Energetic Self experiences all of these different things concurrently, and therefore,benefits from it.It's just that those of us in this environment,this event space don't see these things whilst we are in this here,because we're too low frequency and it would just confuse us. I've mentioned that one of my students in India had a son who was uncontrollably moving between different event spaces.There were two other event spaces that he was going through.It was confusing beyond belief,because that individual thought he was doing something that was going to benefit him or was going to work well or was doing jobs and roles he had to do to work with a particular event space,and then he suddenly finds himself back in an event space and finds out that it was completely incorrect.Or individuals who the other parallel version of him had worked with said he'd done something that he couldn't remember. So it's not just the case that we're moving around event spaces or parallel conditions,but it's quite likely that those other parallel versions of us were moving through our event space as well. Everything is used for ascension purposes of the True Energetic Self.If we have lots and lots and lots of different event spaces we're working with,you can imagine how much parallel processingis going on at the True Energetic Self level.It's experiencing lots and lots of things concurrently,which is really efficient in terms of ascension and in terms of progressing and evolving as a result of that(1/2018). When a parallel world collapses,what happens to the parallel self?Do its sentient energies go back to the soul that projected it?Or can they go off to do "something else?"Is that done through another parallel projection offanother branch? My understanding is that that "something else"is basically returning back to the mainstream event space that created that particular branch. If you have a trunk of event space and we make a decision that takes us away from that trunk,a part of us continues on the trunk and may go into a different branch later.But a part of us stays in this trunk,another part of us goes in the branch. So we split into two totally self-contained,knowledgeable,capable, educated,aware of who and what we are in terms of the work that we're doing in that particular event space.We're totally capable and we move into different things.Then maybe we have another decision where we go forwards or we can go towards another branch,so we start to fractalize. As that branch comes to an evolutionary dead end where we have experienced all we can achieve in that particular branch-if we've gone down to a point where there is a twig,for instance-we move back down to the branch,so that part of us,which has parallelized into another branch with an evolutionary dead end then gets withdrawn back into the previous branch or even trunk that it was fractalized from. So the doing "something else"is coming back to where it was.Or it may well be that the sentient energies associated with that are then recollected and reprojected into another change in direction,another event space,because that sentience needs to be used to do that,because the parallel conditions are ebbing and flowing,so to speak. The "something else"can be moving back into communion with the rest of the sentient energy in a more upstream function of the event space or it can be reused to experience something where there's going to be another choice,and therefore,another event space is going to created further on downstream(1/2018). Do most souls choose to explore some utopian and dystopian worlds as part of their evolution in most lifetimes?There are a few TV shows about dystopian worlds (e.g.where Hitler won WWI or synthetic humans take over humanity,etc.).If we diversify in all these different parallel ways in each lifetime,then it blows my mind? Yes,it blows most people's minds,including mine sometimes.We explore these other worlds,utopian,dystopian,average,boring, advancing,technologically advanced,civilization-based advanced, energetically advanced simply as a function of moving into the event spaces where these things are happening as a result of the choices that are made by ourselves and those other incarnate entities around us, and therefore,the event space that is created as a result of that. So it's more like it happens,but it's not specifically designed to happen that way.The randomness associated with the fractal generation of event spaces is the beauty of it.It's not that we choose to explore a utopian society or one society where one thing happened,but it didn't in another society,for instance,as a result of parallel conditions and the event spaces.It's just that it happens as a result of the choices that we make. From our perspective,as a smaller projected aspect of our True Energetic Self,it's mind blowing full stop.We don't have the sentient capacity whilst incarnate to be able to absorb all of this stuff.When we are disincarnate we do,because we work with a higher frequency condition and the information in those higher frequencies becomes available to us.Our functionality increases,so we can assimilate it on an instantaneous,complete,robust and full understanding as well.This happens outside of the incarnate state.

All these things that happen concurrently,as they happen in the different event spaces,they are totally assimilated by the True Energetic Self constantly all the time.All those things assimilated by all of the True Energetic Selves created by our Source are assimilated by Source.All that is assimilated by all the different Source Entities and all of their different creations are assimilated by the Origin. It's a sort of an upward hierarchical structure where the Origin enjoys everything that the Source Entities experience either directly or indirectly through their creations.The Source Entities enjoy everything that's created through their creations from an indirect perspective.Our True Energetic Selves enjoy what we create for them indirectly as well. The True Energetic Self will experience all of these different fractalized versions of ourselves concurrently.From our perspective,it has infinite capacities to do so.It's like a part of us is working with another part that has chosen a different way.For instance,one of us chooses to be a doctor,while another one chooses to be an engineer.One chooses to be a medical nurse,while another one chooses to be a botanist.We experience all the decisions associated with those events in different event spaces and fractalized event streams within those event spaces as well. If you look at it from a static perspective,we will experience all of these different types of worlds and experiences and states of beingness on Earth and in various different environments and bodies (or form factors)around the physical universe in a single level structure and in a completely fractalized structure associated with the different event spaces and it's all done concurrently. I saw an image of all this working and it's like trees growing trees growing trees within a sphere,which is growing a tree.It's just everything is growing.Everything is part of something else or it's connected to something else.It's unbelievable and everything is being experienced concurrently.It's too difficult for us to get our heads around it.We just have to work with what's there and recognize that there are bigger things afoot and those bigger things are us,but we'll only find them out when we become disincarnate (1/2018). Do alternative realities manifest when two or more players interact and the reality that is experienced differs due to each player having a different vision ofthe potential outcome? If two or more players interact with a reality-an individualized local reality-that's theirs,they're creating a small area of collectivity as a synergistic effect.If those two players differ,then they will not be part of each other's reality.They will move away from each other and find somebody who supports their reality. So the individualized reality needs to have another individual who supports it before it becomes a reality.Otherwise,it just becomes an estranged position to be in a prospective thought process.That's why people try to seek out people who think in the same way.There's an old saying that birds of a feather flock together.That's the same as creation or manifestation of a localized reality (2/2018). Does the reality one experiences depend upon one's level of awareness?

Yes,of course.We have the human reality that we're in,that we create and work with,and we have the greater reality,which we can respond to.The level of frequency that we're able to work with allows us to see the reality supported by the first three frequencies (FB 1-3)where we are part of the gross physical universe vs.the greater reality,which includes the fourth,fifth,sixth,frequency and higher.The higher frequency we are,the more we're able to interact with a greater reality, which should be more stable(2/2018). Why does it seem to be that people that are less self aware and more self-absorbed create dissonance?Is this dissonance responsible for creating the possibility for alternative realities to manifest? That's because they really are being a human being.They are being selfish,because they are seeking other self-serving individuals.When you're working in a more self-aware or less self-absorbed position,you understand that the reality that's around you is something that is to be worked with and not specifically changed or manipulated. Those who are selfish only want to have what they want to have surrounded by individuals who support that reality as well.This is what happens.It's all about selfishness,about super-individuality rather than being less individual and more collective in the thought processes or in being of service(2/2018). It seems that reality is dictated by awareness-closed-minded folks see things from a limited view,which reinforces their biases.When your perspective is more inclusive and broad,the more likely you are to see multiple realities as potential outcomes? Correct.You also see these multiple realities as part of the bigger reality that supports everything.So you see the smaller reality within the bigger reality and then you stop seeing them as a smaller reality.You start to see them as part of the bigger reality and the potentials for experiencing different things within that bigger reality(2/2018). You said Event Space is not sentient any longer.It's not even consciousness,it's just intelligence.But ifEvent Space is what creates all the parallel conditions for our parallel selves to explore by manipulating energies and frequencies,then isn't Event Space sentient by default,because it is creativity at its best?What am I missing here? The creation of the event spaces,event streams and event bubbles are a function of what we do.The parallel conditions are also a function of what we do.We are the entities in the creative and evolutionary cycle. Event Space has an automatic trigger that triggers things by just having enough intelligence to be able to work out when there is a need for an alternative existence.This allows a series of events to happen upstream in supporting it and downstream to support it later to allow a different series of events to occur.Therefore,different levels of experience occur independently of those that would have happened,if a different choice was being made. So it's not so much sentience that's there,it's more of an automatic function based upon a necessary level of intelligence to allow that automatic Event Space function to occur.Sentience doesn't play a part in this,because sentience is a function of being creative.Although one could argue that the creation of another event space is creativity in its own right,actually it's just a separation and a duplication of an existing environment. So it's not creativity per se or creativity with a view to experience,learn and evolve from something and then to modify that experience and re- understand it.It's simply creation of another environment to allow those entities within it to also experience,learn and evolve in that parallelized or concurrent state.It's more of an automatic function rather than an intelligently understanding,knowing and creative function. There's a big difference there.So think of it in terms of something, which is created in an automatic way(5/2018). You talk about "spherical event space."Why is it spherical,like a bubble?Why not amoeboid or irregular or shapeshifting?Is it spherical within our multiverse where the universes are nested spheres within spheres,because energy takes a spherical form here? The word "spherical"is just something that's used to describe a condition we can understand.Clearly,if I said "amorphous,"there would be no anchor point,no datum for us to use.We have to use something that we can work with.Initially,our level of education is based upon a stepping stone that allows us to understand holistically what we're experiencing,what we're being told or educated in and then we can move onto a different level of understanding. There are "event space bubbles"described in The Curators.Event space bubbles are a different way of thinking,because it's where things are contained within a certain event space.An event space bubble is an individualized series of events,which don't go anywhere.They stay where they are and don't move on too much,because they are a self- contained group of events rather than leading from one to another. But an "event stream bubble"is something different.It's where each event is a bubble of interaction between an entity or a being and the environment it's working within.The bubbles or events can grow and explode into another bubble or shrink and implode into nothingness. Bubbles that grow sometimes explode into a nearby bubble to create a new combined bubble. They can explode into a new bigger bubble that allows them to cope with an expansion of event fractals that are all still combined together in that event space,which was created for the original and static event stream.Those bubbles or events that shrink and implode either disappear totally,which represents an end of that event stream or they implode and reappear within another event.When a bubble has naturally ended its usefulness,it implodes back into its originating event stream bubble. So there's a bit of an explanation there for you all.But if you think of it in terms of collective environments,event space being spherical is like I sometimes describe the universe as being spherical.But actually it's more amorphous than that.Actually a bubble doesn't have to be round or spherical,does it?If you get some washing up liquid(detergent)into some water and just use a hoop and blow through the hoop with the soapy water,you'll get an elongated bubble. The shape of an event space bubble is based upon what the entities within it do and what the different event streams within it are working with in different micro-event spaces as well.There's lots and lots of different things going on there that will help to explain that But even our energy isn't particularly spherical.When people say that I've done astral traveling and I look like a sphere.Well,that's the only thing that you can relate to in terms of sentience associated with energy.Lack of gravity allows water to become a sphere,because its surface tension creates a spheroid.But we could create whichever form we wanted to with our sentient energy when we are disincarnate or astral traveling.It's just that the sphere just happens to be a comfortable and an understandable form that we can use. Spherical event space doesn't necessarily need to be totally spherical.It can be whatever it needs to be to support the expansion and contraction of events within event streams within that particular event space.But that event space bubble is usually individualized and doesn't connect with other event spaces to create a wider event stream (5/2018). When creating an event space to be happening in the Now,what is Now,since time doesn't exist?I am visualizing for my event space to happen Now,but it isn't.Why is it not happening now?Why does it take months till things happen?Why a time delay? This is a very good question,because if everything is happening now, why isn't it happening now?Sometimes we have to work with certain events that link together.We have to work with some of the event streams and event bubbles as well.This suggests that things are linear and they sort of are and they aren't.They exist within and without each other,so the start of one event may be the end of a different event.Or the end of one event may be the end of another event and the start of another event. If you think about the way event streams can work and link in together, sometimes they are linear,but sometimes they are fractals of each other and sometimes they link back into each other.One way of seeing it as an image is to look at a dandelion seed where you've got a puffball of seeds that are linked together by little vanes of fluffiness that allow the seeds to travel If you think about the central point of that seed on the dandelion as the start of one particular event space,then all the rest of those things that come off it are the fractalized versions of that event space.They all link into the same event space,but they're all individualized as well.Then think about the central event space on the dandelion seed as being within the centralized point of one of those seeds and you start to see that everything is linked in together. There are times when our guides and helpers are working with other guides and helpers of other individuals who are incarnate within our event space.They all have to work within the event stream and the event stream bubbles that they're working with.We have to be patient for everything to be in the right event space.Although everything is happening in the now,there are times when event spaces have to converge to make it work properly. This is why we sometimes get the human perception of everything happening in different nows or different times.But when we are disincarnate,from an overall perspective everything is happening in the now.Everything happens instantaneously,so all different versions of things happen concurrently.It can happen concurrently now or in a month's time now or in three months'time now or two or ten years' time now or two centuries'now. It's all about logging into the different event spaces that's giving you the version of now that is giving you what you're expecting to be happening.If something is happening now and you're experiencing it now,it's because you're supposed to experience it now.If you're able to turn off this connectivity with this event space and move into a different event space where the other version of now is happening,for instance,a version of now in three months'time,then you bring that three months'now into this now,and therefore,you can experience everything concurrently. So it's just about working with these different versions of event space, event streams and event stream bubbles,so to speak,and recognizing that things have to happen around it to create these links together.It's not that event space is created on its own,we create event spaces.There are individuals who create event spaces that circumnavigate other event spaces,so things that were supposed to happen don't happen. This is something that I've experienced and my late wife has experienced where you go see a medium or somebody who says,"Well, I'm seeing this happening,"but it doesn't happen.It's because something has happened that's negated that particular event stream from being linked in to the event stream that you're in. It's very difficult to get one's head around,but it's all about understanding that everything is being experienced in the now.It's just that sometimes we're not focused on the rest of nows to be able to see it in the now,so we have to be patient.We are in a very low frequency environment where things don't happen in the way that we know they should happen at higher frequency.So we have to work with this low frequency,the level of now we can access,knowing it's happening and then be patient. Or be capable of linking in to that desired version of now,which is reality.Or be powerful enough in our conviction that we swing ourselves into these other versions of now or bring these other versions of now into this now,so we think it's happening concurrently for us(7/2018). If you put your vision into "straightaway"and it doesn't seem to be happening,is that from not enough trust?Or just being impatient?Or you going in the wrong direction and your guides are trying to steer you to the right path? This question is linked in with the response I had on event space about everything being now in various different types of nowness.Although everything now is now,we have to focus on the wider now that incorporates the rest of now to be able to see what is going to happen now. So if something is in the three months'forwards part of the now,how do we bring it into this now?We can,but that now is a function of the result of interactions with other entities and beings,including our guides and helpers and the environment we're supposed to be in to be all working together within that event space or event stream bubble or event stream. So it's all about giving ourselves the expansivity to see beyond the immediate now.Let's call it the immediate now and the wider now, because the wider now is what we can't see,but the immediate now is what we can experience now-knowing that the immediate now incorporates everything that's happened,will happen,is going to happen,which doesn't really exist,because it's all now.It's all concurrently happening.This is the way to think about it(7/2018). In The Anne Dialogues you wrote,"the Aspect that has the capability of experiencing the Event Spaces of other versions of itself will benefit from its parallel existences by accruing the evolutionary content associated with these experiences...and experience them concurrently rather than linearly."What does that mean? If an aspect is of a high enough frequency through its own personal work or if it incarnates with a different level of frequency (e.g.rainbow, indigo and crystal children or their hybrids),then they will be able to link into different event spaces and link into different realities and sometimes link into the different aspects of their True Energetic Self. They can experience things in a number of different ways. In the event that they don't understand what's going on,we can get some forms of "psychosis"appearing where people can't work out why they're seeing things around them that other people can't or why they're communicating with different entities and other people can't. They start to lose a grip of themselves and their ability to navigate through this incarnation,because everything they're receiving is contradictory to what they're being told by those around them.So that becomes difficult. In fact,those around them don't understand them in the first place,so they label them as being "psychotic"in some way,shape or form.When this happens,unless there is somebody who can say this is what's happening to you (because they can log into them and see the connections between the frequencies,the abilities or functions and the dissociation between everybody else around them),then that person won't know that what they're experiencing is real.They won't be able to relate to it at all and those individuals won't be able to help them either. But once you get somebody who says,"Okay,this is what's going on- it's real."They give them some way of training themselves,so they can turn it on and turn it off and give themselves a rest.Or they'll be able to navigate through it,so they don't turn it off,but understand where to focus their sentience at one point in space,so they can communicate in a rational,regular and robust way in that particular environment If they find their consciousness or sentience wanders to another event space that they're experiencing,they can work with that as well.If they wanted to,they could communicate with themselves in different event spaces,understand and experience those event spaces being created through their decision processes.They can learn to focus their sentience here now,but the other potential focuses and event spaces are also available to them. In this instance,the ability to experience these things and recognize that they're in different event spaces,different realities,and that they can work with those concurrently allows the aspect to not only navigate through the greater reality whilst incarnate,but also evolve at a rapid pace as well,because they're stretching themselves beyond the localized and singularized event space that they are focused upon,so it's a big thing. I seem to remember a StarTrek episode where "Q"was testing Picard (StarTrek:The Next Generation,Season 7,Episode 25,"All Good Things" where Captain Picard finds himself shifting continually into the past, future and present).He was throwing him into different realities or different event spaces to see how expansive he was,to see if he could link up with what was being experienced by him in these different event spaces,work with them and know that they were different event spaces. There was something there that was concurrent in all of those different realities that he could use to link them all together.This is a similar sort of thing.Once we can start to work with these things concurrently,we can experience everything-every decision we make-the way we've gone one way rather than another way.We can experience it all concurrently and use that to navigate around it to accelerate our evolution(12/2018). What is the mechanics to move from one event space to another? It's simply using intention.We move from one event space to another when we have a choice.We have a choice to do this or that,go one way rather than another way,buy this or not buy it.Maybe we have two choices or three choices or four choices.This is something that we have to work with and think about.In terms of consciously moving from one event space to another,that's a real high function.I would suggest that only extremely evolved individuals can do this and know that they're in that event space. But collectively we have moved into an event space that we shouldn't be in.With all the nonsense that's happening around the world right now,we're not in the same event space we were in.We've all collectively chosen to experience this,an alternative group or global event space to experience something that is quite clearly happening with no apparent control of ourselves. We can all see that what's happening is wrong,but we can't change it. That's because we've moved from one event space to another.If we all have the right intention to move from one particular knowledge system or desire system to another,we'll do it.We've actually done that and the function of inflational triangulation has pulled a lot of different individuals-us-into it as well. There are some individuals who have moved into it and are saying actually this isn't the reality we're supposed to be in.They work within it,but are not part of it,whereas others are immersed in it as well. Moving from one event space to another is simply by using your intention to change your reality.We can have realities within an event space.They are parallel environments.But it's all about changing,so you can meditate on this and change your environment,change the things that happen around you.That allows you to move from one event space to another,because you're using your intention to change your environment,your reality,so to speak.That's one way of doing it (6/2019). In The Curators you said that Event Space only provides the SPACE, but other entities actually create what is IN that space.I thought that Event Space duplicated what was in that space,not us.But you gave us a meditation to change our parallel self's path by backtracking a branch or joining other branches to get back to our mainline life path. Are the event space changes created by us?By one parallel self from our soul with a Desire-Intention-Thought-Action? What I'm being shown here is that if you think about what's been said in The Curators as being Event Space only creates the space,but other entities actually create what's in that space,you have to think of it in a different way. Let's say,you can copy one building.In this building,there's lots of people working,living,enjoying themselves,etc.,but you create another building,which is a complete duplicate of that building.It's still the building,but the people aren't in there. So Event Space creates the environment that needs to be created as a function of our decision processes.That also creates different realities, of course.But when we get a collective event space being created that's big enough to create a completely new environment,what we have is the environment that is copied over. So it copies everything-individuals as well.That's the space.Then everything starts or functions without our knowledge of the fact that it's been duplicated.We have another part of us,which has been created that is another one of us,which is working within a collective event space that is a function of our choices or the other choice we could have had,that link in with those choices that others could have had,so to speak.Then we start to create what is IN that event space (12/2019). Are the changes made by the Curators in charge ofthat level of Event Space function and optimization?Who is the true creator-us,our Source,Curators or Event Space? The Event Space creates the space as it is.It's a complete copy.Think of it as a carbon copy.But then what's in that space is modified by those aspects that are duplicated or copied into that space. In essence,everything is the creator.The Origin is creator.Source is creator.We're creators.Curators are creators.Sometimes we create event spaces that aren't necessary.Sometimes we create event spaces that are in the wrong place.That's when the Curators come in. Sometimes they need to create an event space to join up event spaces,if they've come out of a natural alignment of event space. It's very complicated to understand,but everything has an effect on Event Space.That includes anything that is involved in a decision or choice process as a possibility of creating a new event space,whether it's an individualized or localized one or a huge multiversally sized event space. Getting back to The Curators where it said Event Space only provides the space,but other entities actually create what's in that space.The creation of what's in that space is and starts from the point at which that event space is created.So everything is duplicated and then it moves forwards.That's the creation of what is in the event space. The Event Space creates everything in one go,but it's devoid of creativity.It's devoid of expression.It's devoid of evolutionary progression.A second later,it starts to experience that,because the copied individuals,copied aspects move into it and start to work with it and start to experience it and change it again. It's difficult for people to understand.People might think that we create an event space and there's nothing in it.But no,there's whole galaxies in there.There's planets in there,if it's a universally sized event space.If it's a planetary sized event space,then there's a planet in there and everything that's in there. It's not a raw space,it is a carbon copy of what was there,which has achieved nothing,experienced nothing and then a second later it starts to do that,because the other individuals who are part of the decision process start to interact with that decision process.Others within that space want to experience whatever decision process got them there (12/2019). What happens to the other parallels?Are they dissolved,if they are downstream from where we started backtracking?Isn't that counterproductive for our Higher Selfs evolution,if it's trying to diversify its experience via parallel selves? No,everything continues.When we get a carbon copy and we get a new event space created,the old event space is still there and can still duplicate.So everything continues.It's only when the evolutionary dead end is achieved,the natural end of event,that that event space then moves back into the mainstream or the next mainstream part of the event space,so to speak. So everything continues.If you think about it,you've got one which goes into two,which goes into four,which goes into eight,which goes into sixteen,which goes into 32,64 and 128,etc.Then you see that what was being experienced by the first one,which went into two,is duplicated,which went into four,so it's quadrupled. Everything is happening,but each of those times at a duplication you start to see a variation upon what is going to be experienced downstream or currently,because of the decisions that are being made by the individual in that duplicated but new event space(12/2019). Or is it more like"trimming"our event tree of life (like a rose bush)to make things more efficient,to get rid of the dying or dead branches to allow new growth to take place? That happens when we get to the end of event,which is in effect the end of the evolutionary opportunity,the evolutionary dead end or the experiential dead end.Then things start to trim back.They start to nip back into the next mainstream that was part of what allowed them to be created. If you had an oak tree and and you see the trunk going up,that's the mainstream from which all the branches start the fractalization or different event spaces being created.If you turned the tree it on its head,all those branches would look like roots.Then all the roots go back into the main trunk,which is how all the different fractalizations or event spaces coalesce back together again into the main event event space or the trunk (12/2019). In Beyond the Source-Book I Source Entity 5 said,"There is the possibility of meeting an alternative YOU in an alternative reality,if you choose to work on two or more realities at the same time, which...most of you do."Do we actually?Is there an alternate Guy Needler or me in any alternate reality?How do we know if we're doing this? We exist in multiple realities,because we create them in a fractalized way through our choices.There are realities where the Guy Needler didn't meet the "you"here.There are realities where Guy Needler didn't meet Dolores Cannon.There are realities where he met Dolores Cannon at a different time or a future time and all these different things. There's lots of different fractalizations of realities that we're part of. By and large,we don't have the capacity to understand which particular reality we're in.All we know is that we're in this reality and that's fine. We should be working in this reality,because that is the way that our TES parallel processes.As we create alternative realities from alternative choices,we have different versions of ourselves that fractalize out. Every entity does this,whether they are incarnate or disincarnate. That's how we parallel process.That's how evolution accelerates. It is possible to meet an alternative version of us,but maybe we've got to be connected to that alternative.Maybe we've got to be higher frequency,so we can observe the connections between our True Energetic Self and other True Energetic Selves in different realities and the aspects projected into the different realities that are created through their individualized choices. When we're higher frequency and can operate in a higher level of connectivity,we start to be in the Now-the multiple Now rather than the individualized singular Now.Then we can start to see the alternative versions of ourselves as they exist.There's not many of us who can see the multiple versions of ourselves.I have met a couple of people who randomly and uncontrollably move from one reality to another. For instance,a young man in India was doing it and is still doing it.But he's going through a different set of realities now rather than the first set of realities he was going into.He's doing it sometimes to escape the reality that he is experiencing.Sometimes this particular Now version isn't liked,so we go into different realities,because we prefer to be in them.But in those instances,they don't see themselves in those realities,they just substitute themselves in those realities(5/2020). I experience different things every time I do the Satsanga meditation (e.g.connecting with nature).Are we accessing the original Event Space created by you and creating new Event Spaces forming clusters of Event Spaces?How are we using your original Event Space to advance ourselves? We create event spaces that interact with other event spaces.We can be within an event space within an event space,within an event space, within an event space that's interacting with another event space. Event spaces are within and without each other. We choose to enter into an event space,but that event space also includes our own localized event space.You are choosing to enter into my event space,which is open to you all.But that event space you go into also has your event space as a component that you're interacting with by listening to the World Satsanga. There are times when you will have a focus on something different, which creates a different event space.So your interaction with my event space will be slightly different.Every event space we interact with can be different or the same. In this instance,the next time we have a Satsanga,use your intention to stay in the sameevent space while listening to the Satsanga for the first time.In the second time,say you want to stay in the same event space that you had the first time.Do the same thing for the third time.You will be able to control your event spaces. If we just randomly move into an event space,then we take those aspects or components of that event space with us for that particular function of event space that we're working with.It's a bit complicated, but I think that answers the question (6/2021). On Earth are all events and experiences caused by natural causes and humans creating events and experiences,such as wars,disease, technological advancements,arts,spiritual growth,etc.?Or are there otherworldly interventions in events like WWII? There's two parts to the answer.The first part is we've got individualized free will to experience,learn and evolve individually and collectively in a way which is beneficial to us.That means we can go down the dark hole as well as come out of the dark hole into the light. We're allowed to do so-called "good things"and "bad things,"because the idea is that we choose eventually to do the correct way,which is to be of service,to be respectful,to be caring and sharing and loving. But we also need to understand there are other roads or choices where the result is aggression,anxiety,depression and destruction.We're given this Adam and Eve opportunity to choose.Do we choose to have individual free will or do we choose to obey Source?If we chose to obey Source,we would have been given much more freedom than we would have with free will as an example. We know that individualized free will could create an accelerated rate of evolutionary progression.But the soul called Lucifer also knew through its projections through the records that we could potentially go down the frequencies as well.But that information was withheld from the Council of souls that were governing the project with individualized free will (7/2021). The Allied Forces in WWII were victorious,but it didn't have to be that way.The Third Reich could be thriving right now?Is that because ofexternal intervention? If we're given certain things,such as certain souls embedded with certain knowledge or feelings or desires to become great inventors or great reformers,we're given other souls who are great antagonists as well.Sometimes there are little spanners that push in the works to change the way things happen as well. For instance,there are maintenance entities who are able to change event streams or the course of realities and the course of so-called "future timelines,"etc.Sometimes it's us and sometimes it's the maintenance entities that change the way,because they can see that some directions we're going to are not going to be of benefit to us.They may end up being totally self-destructive. They can leave us to do certain things,because they know that eventually we will understand that what we're doing is not the right way,not good or optimal for our evolutionary progression.So sometimes there is intervention,but not interference.There is interaction on different levels. It could be gross physical interaction.It could be spirituo-physical interaction at the frequencies above the three gross physical frequencies.There is incarnation there,but it's outside our detectable range,so we can't see,smell,taste or feel it or detect it with our machines,because they're all based upon our five human senses. Sometimes those otherworldly interactions are from the maintenance entities or other souls that are still in the energetic.There's no one answer to that question.We are allowed to play in the playground within the Earth.Sometimes what we do in the playground is of benefit and sometimes it isn't of benefit,so we're guided to move in a different direction (7/2021).

### Evolutionary Content 

This refers to our evolution or experiential knowledge accumulated from incarnations within the physical universe and from exploring the energetic universes within the rest of the multiverse.The location of our True Energetic Selfreflects the evolutionary content accrued so farin the cycle. What is our Source Entity trying to achieve by creating True Energetic Selves and aspects (souls)and shards (sub-souls)? Acquiring "evolutionary content"is a bit vague? Evolutionary content is a result of experiencing,learning and evolving. If you think of it in terms of a very linear function,the more helpers you've got (as a creator entity),the more chance you've got of understanding yourself and in a faster and deeper way as well. The function of the TES and the aspects and shards is to experience, learn and evolve as a result of deepening the understanding of Self and working with different environments,different events,different aspects and shards in different frequential environments or different universes or different realities available to them. It's to do with a complete holographic understanding of who and what the TES is on the micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-microscopic aspect. The TES is looking at absolute minute detail,so it needs smaller entities to do that on its behalf. We operate on the "macroverse"level,but we can't see what an electron microscope can see on the "microverse"level where viruses or bacteria can be seen.The microverse differs from the "nanoverse"level where everything is nanosized or even smaller.The TES works on all of these levels(11/2016). What is evolutionary content and why does it need to be acquired?Is it as simple as our Source Entity wants to expand and know itself? Evolutionary content is a progressive state of understanding,the culmination of understanding,the interface with something and some individuals from many different angles. It's a bit like understanding how to eat steak,such as rare,super rare, medium or well done steak and then you could have chips with it or beans or rice or wine or different types of wine.It's experiencing the same things in multiple different ways to gain a full understanding of what that experience is.That's the holographic way. In doing that,it expands its knowledge,gains evolution and something beyond evolution,which I'm told to call "progression."It moves forwards from that.As the Source's understanding of Self increases,so does the Origin's understanding of Self. Evolution is a full understanding from every perceivable angle and different variance or parallel condition of something or some interaction with other entities.I think "evolution"from a Darwinian perspective is classified simply as survival of the fittest or the strongest or the cleverest,whereas in actuality it's experientialexperiential from a parallel condition,a parallel of a parallel of a parallel of a parallel condition,etc. If it can be experienced and it can be experienced in different ways,it should be experienced in all those different ways.Simple as that, although it clearly is a much deeper response(11/2016). If all evolutionary content is a form of growth,positive or negative, how do we recognize,avoid or minimize the deleterious impact of spiraling down the frequencies,which seem a necessity for the soul journey?How do we work our way back up and move on? A solid plan is based upon using the observer self,not being judgmental but stopping yourself in the tracks,stopping the addiction by changing the thoughts,behaviors and actions that are low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions.Or asking somebody else to be the observer self, somebody who loves you that you're going to take notice of is another way of doing this. If you can't trust yourself using your observer self,use somebody else to be the observer self for you.It's probably not a goodidea to use your partner,husband or wife.It's probably somebody like a friend.Try to find somebody who you're with all the time,other than your partner who is able to observe you in your thoughts,behaviors and actions.You may want to go to a spiritual counselor,but they can't be with you all the time. When you're working your way up again,you start to regain the functionality associated with higher frequency existence.Your intuition increases.Your clairsentience,knowingness,and ability to communicate with other entities increases and the ability to observe the rest of the environment in the frequencies above where we are increases. We start to be more connected.We start to experience more things. The human eye starts to be more capable than it is now,so you can start to see the overlay of the third eye on the physical eye vision.If we've experienced these things before,but then move down the frequencies, we tend to think we've dreamed them.We think it's something that's happened that we can't re-achieve.But we can re-achieve it. We have to continue to work on ourselves,to recognize that we need to move onwards and upwards.It's hard work.Some souls do put themselves in a position of an almost death spiral,a spiral downwards that you can't stop to see what they need to do to come out of it.That is a way of accruing serious evolutionary progression(not karma). Even though the experience of negative thoughts,behaviors and actions is an evolutionary level,we've already been there.We've experienced it in previous lives,so all we're doing is going over old ground. It's a bit like painting the wall twice.When you change the color of the wall with paint,you experience the change the first time you've changed the color.When you go over that wall again with the same color,you don't get the same level of satisfaction,because you've done it once. All you're doing is making sure that you're not missing any part by going over it.Although you might argue that there is a level of additional experience and evolution associated with going deeper into something,in actual fact we have gone deeper into it in most cases. But the downward spiral aspect where we have to put ourselves into a flat spin and try and get ourselves out of it is quite a common life profile for people and one where they put themselves in extreme situations to see if they can come out the other side.I'm not suggesting that anybody puts themselves into a downward spiral that is difficult to get out of.You've got to be an extremely resolute,robust and dedicated individual to stop the spin,to stop the downward descent and create an upward ascent.It's very,very difficult(8/2016). There is a fine line between so-called "spiritual bypassing"(e.g. avoiding pain,temptations and conflict with others by detaching or disengaging from life)and "indifference"as stated by Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel: "The opposite of love is not hate,but indifference.Indifference creates evil. Hatred is evil itself.Indifference is what allows evil to be strong,what gives it power.I have no doubt that evil can be fought and that indifference is no option.When I went to Cambodia /Pol Pot's "killing fields"journalists asked me,"What are you doing here?This is not a lewish tragedy."I answered,"When I needed people to come,they didn't.That's why I am here."-Elie Wiesel Let's go to "spiritual bypassing"or ignoring pain,temptations and conflict by detaching yourself.Alot of people think that we're avoiding responsibility by using this term "spiritual bypassing."They think that we're avoiding the interaction we're supposed to have with our environment,that we are avoiding the experiences we're supposed to be having,and that we are removing responsibility for what we're doing and just bumming around basically.The answer is we're not. We are detaching ourselves from the human aspect of what we are whilst we're here.We are detaching ourselves from the immersion in this reality and giving ourselves time to reflect,think,behave and act in a way,which is in accordance with the higher state of beingness. That allows us to respond in a better way,more efficient way,more evolved way.When we do that,we've passed it onto others,because it's an energy exchange. So it's not spiritual bypassing,it's actually being detached from the panic stations,the immediacy,the instant gratification of being here and allowing ourselves to be a more complete individual-one that fully understands the environment that they're in and the interactions that they have to do in that environment and how to respond to individuals within those interactions.So it's not bypassing anything (3/2017). In The Origin Syeaks,the Origin said the main function of the library of progression is to store all ofthe actions and experiences that result in steps of evolutionary progression.What is a step of evolutionary progression?Is there an end to this stairway or process? The evolutionary progression isn't in steps-it's like a stepless function.There are things that could be classified as being a piece of evolution,and therefore,something that we've worked with. We can classify it as being evolved,but that's a human thing.If one animal changes from one form to another form-for instance,if a cat changes its physiology,so it's got five toes or six toes rather than four toes,that could be classified as an evolutionary step. But from the point of view of experiencing,learning and evolving, there is no real evolutionary step other than a point of experience and when the learning from that experience is understood.If it's understood instantaneously or in one interaction with it or even a couple of interactions with it,then that level of experience doesn't need to be experienced again,then arguably you could call that an evolutionary step(6/2017). Does it only concern the Origin? Evolution is generally something,which is attributable to the Origin, although it created smaller versions,Source Entities,to evolve on its behalf.Our Source Entity and other Source Entities have done similar things.They have created an environment and individualized parts of their own sentience that were given a body of energy to work with,to allow them to evolve in a more accelerated way by allowing smaller versions of themselves to experience,learn and evolve.We do the same thing as our True Energetic Self.It creates us as souls and we can do the same thing by creating shards. So everything evolves and as everything evolves,everything is evolving.What it means is that as we evolve as smaller units of ourselves or Source or Origin,then everything evolves.Even though we as individualized units evolve,the end game is that the Origin evolves.We all evolve as smaller versions either created by Origin or created by the creations of the Origin to help the Origin evolve. Even though we're individualized and we're evolving,that evolution is passed on to the True Energetic Self,passed on to Source and passed on to the Origin.As far as I'm aware,it's ongoing,it's never ending.The Origin is so big that it hasn't even mapped out its own polyomniscient sentient area of self-awareness right now.That's what the Source Entities and we are doing right now.When we've gone through this first section,then there's other sections we've got to go through to experience,learn and evolve.So it's truly infinite as far as I'm aware (6/2017). Does everything we do contribute to this progression?For instance, brushing my teeth?Or is it only parts ofour experiences?Or none? Everything does-everything we do is to do with experiencing things. There is also learning and evolution from that no matter how small it is or no matter how simple it is (6/2017). If the Origin stores the actions and experiences that result in its growth,are there actions and experiences that don't result in its growth?For instance,if I drown a man or if I save a man from drowning,does one experience get stored or do both?Does everything count? Absolutely everything counts.Even the decision not to do something counts towards evolution,because it's a decision process based upon a level of understanding,which may have been not there previously (6/2017). What does it mean that the Origin is storing actions and experiences? Is it like a video copy?Is the actual action somehow stored? It's the essence of everything from being in the gross physical from our perspective to making a decision,having the sensory responses,some of the thinking process behind it and the potential to improve it.It's the whole gamut of things associated with experiencing what we're experiencing-right down to stubbing your toe,for instance.It's that simple.Everything that's experienced goes into being recorded and is part of the overall experiential set of learning and evolution that the Origin has(6/2017). Once stored,does the Origin ever do anything with these records?Or do they just sit there forever? It (like us)uses them as a repository of experiences that can be drawn upon to enable similar experiences to be interacted with in a more efficient way.They are this library of stuff that the Source or the Origin has that it can use to do various different things. It's us experiencing it.It's us experiencing the very minute detail of what it is.If the Origin wanted to experience the minute detail of what we're experiencing and it wanted to do it on its own,it would draw upon the experiences that have been gained through our work to help it interact with that experience in a way,which is probably more effective,giving better results or is more repeatable and robust. Everything is there and other parts of it may want to use it as well.For instance,if another Source Entity wanted to be able to experience a different part of the Origin and that part of the Origin overlaps with something that our Source has experienced,then it may want to use the experience that we've given to our Source,which has been passed on to Origin,to work with that and gain a different level or depth of experience.It may well take some of this information as being part of its library of experiences that can be used and drawn upon(6/2017). Will we be able to review our actions and experiences at some time? Yes,we always review everything that we've done.We experience everything we've done unless we're having a back-to-back incarnation. That's where we have an incarnation that allows the soul to go into one incarnation and when the human body demises,we come out of that and go straight into another life,if we're linking lives together to have alonger experience,which is linked together through different lives. This information is in The Anne Dialogues(see "The Life Review")as well where we get an idea of the review-what we've experienced,how we've experienced it and how we've worked with those experiences. We will always be able to review our actions and experiences,but generally this happens once we're back in the energetic and the gross physical body is demised(6/2017). The question has to do with infinity-God always has and always will be.It seems that there has been a beginning,which was Event Space,which almost destroyed itself creating the Origin.Is there a consciousness associated with the Event Space?Or was there or is there a consciousness as Origin's origin? Event Space was simply an evolutionary direction that everything that is the Origin was-even before it was classified as the Origin.Event Space is as infinite as that which is the Origin is in its omniversal position-polyomniscient,polyomniversal,if you want to call it that. When Event Space recognized that it in itself was limited-to a function of sentience and a function of manipulation of the energies and frequencies and the structure that it existed within-then it realized that another level of evolution or another evolutionary direction of other energies was more in keeping with the ability to become polyomniscient,then it sacrificed its own progression to sentience to allow the Origin to create.There wasn't an Origin's origin, so to speak. The Origin's origin was based upon a natural function of Darwinian evolution-the coalescence of energies and the desire to collect together to each other.It's like water molecules collect with water molecules and oil molecules collect with oil molecules,but they are separate.Eventually,if you have enough water molecules,you will get a level of intelligence associated with those water molecules and the same with the oil molecules.Eventually,you'll get a level of intelligence associated with it and then it grows to being highly intelligent and then self-aware and then conscious and all these different things comes into it. But in terms of consciousness associated with Event Space,it is simply intelligencenow,not consciousness.It sacrificed its level of progression to sentience to allow the other level of evolution to become the dominant level of evolution and the Origin to become the Origin.Now Event Space simply is intelligence and not really consciousness any more.There's recognition of what it is and that it's intelligence,but that's not quite consciousness.It's simply Event Space knows event space. It's not really understanding of what it is from a conscious perspective. It recognizes event space,so that's all the sort of self-awareness it's got really.It could have been very sentient,but it recognized that it was limited-a function of the structure,which is now the Origin.That's why it gave up the possibility of becoming that dominant sentience and assisted that which is now the Origin to become the Origin(4/2018). How did this information get disseminated to Origin,then to Source, then you? I think it's by luck and by asking the right things at the time when I wrote The Origin Speaks.It's my own lineage being Om.I don't like to talk about my own lineage,but I tend to have the ability to log into things and understand certain levels of concepts that can be described in a human way.But even that in its own right is limiting,so I look forward to being disincarnate and experiencing a higher level of connectivity and understanding. But I expect that there was an event space that allowed me to be asking the right questions at the right time and get an answer that was capable of being translated into human language.I would guess that that's available to me right now,but will be available to others later,as we rise with the frequencies. I think it's simply a function of that and a little bit of luck as well-the luck being that I've managed to follow a life plan and not stray off it.If the plan is to get from A to B,how you get there is up to you.You can get there faster or fast or it's simply slow.I think sometimes when we go slow,we miss the boat of what's happening when we get to point B from point A(4/2018). A question about the future,will it all return to the event space or will there be even greater accomplishments that we become? The greater accomplishment is that at some point when all the Source Entities through our work have managed to map out this particular area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness of the Origin,then it goes into the next level of awareness and branches out into that and all the structure associated with that. Some of this work will be discussed in the book,Beyond the Orzein.It's not actually beyond the Origin,it's just beyond the Origin's known area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness where SE12 is helping to create the milestones to assist the Origin in starting to map it out itself in that future event space But in that event space,because the space available is significantly greater,as we move from one piece of structure to another piece of structure-the magnitude is 12 to the power of 12 when we go from a full dimension to a zone and it's 12 to the power of 12 when going from a zone to a continuum,for instance-so as a result our True Energetic Selves have been given Source Entity status.So we can do the things that Source Entities are doing now. The Source Entities will have another level of status-one that is much bigger than the one they've got now.That's the great accomplishment eventually.When we've finished all of our evolutionary cycles,our True Energetic Selves become Source Entities.That will be a wonderful thing to be part of eventually.It will be no doubt very exciting as a True Energetic Self becomes a Source Entity and has all of the powers that a Source Entity has now (4/2018). What if an aspect (soul)achieves enlightenment in one parallel reality and in other parallel realities creates additional karma or kills someone,what happens then? The total experience of both of those parallel conditions is experienced by the True Energetic Self,so there is a "neutralizing effect"associated with the total experience of the aspect as a result of parallel conditions. However,it's quite unlikely that that level of "diversification"is experienced by one particular aspect,specifically if they're achieving enlightenment in one parallel reality. It's rather unlikely that they're going to be an enlightened individual in one reality and a mass murderer in another reality.There will be various different manifestations of minor change based upon one of them,not the other.Although they can swing from one side to the other side in different incarnations,as you move up the frequencies, you get to a point where the objective is more to be of service than to just be immersed in the experience(6/2018). Why has the Origin given birth to this dysfunctional human race-to accrue evolutionary content doesn't seem like a satisfactory answer? What we create is up to us,whether we classify it as being "good"or "bad."That is simply a function of how we want to express and experience things.Eventually,we will move away from creating dysfunctional badness or crime or murder or abject poverty vs.abject wealth,because we'll start to see the futility of it all. This is why we're allowed to do this,because we are allowed to experience wrongness,so we can put it right.We have to experience rightness,so we understand what wrongness is.It's all part of experiencing from an individualized free will perspective that anything we create,we need to be responsible for it and experience it. This level of experience is important,not just for us,our True Energetic Selves and Source,but it's important for the Origin as well.If we experience just the nice bits,it would be a completely dysfunctional level of evolution.It would be biased to one side rather than being holistic.That's why the Origin lets us get on with it and why the Source lets us get on with it and everything else.It's a case of we create what we create,because at some point it's necessary for us to create it.It creates balance within our evolutionary cycle(8/2018). Is there a certain experience in the physical that helps us evolve faster?If we are all experiencing bliss and communion with God in the energetic,but experiencing the opposite,such as solitude in the physical,does that help us evolve faster?If so,what kind of experience has the highest score of evolution? Balanced experience is what gives us the highest score of evolutionary content.We can't just have the good stuff.We have to have the good, the bad and all the bits of shades of gray in between.We need to have the thought process that everything we experience is of benefit irrespective of whether we like it or not. That is the attitude,the state of beingness we need to have in our incarnations to allow us to recognize that we need to be in a state of acceptance.When we're in a state of acceptance,we just deal with what we subsequently end up being part of.We deal with it in the most efficient way without blaming others,just doing it and getting on with it and then finalizing the work to allow us to move onwards.Then we will evolve faster in our incarnation here (1/2021). What is the difference between highly advanced vs.highly evolved being/entity? You can't advance without evolution and you can't evolve without experience-learning from that experience and subsequently gaining evolutionary progression from that experience.So an advanced entity or being or soul is usually one that's highly evolved or well evolved as well.The two go hand in hand really.They can't be separated out. The only thing you can get is the quality of the evolution as a function of the depth and detail that the TES or the aspect or soul has entered into to gain the particular level of evolution,the evolutionary progression it's got through the experiences it has had.It's really a case of those two things are together.From our perspective,an advanced soul is an evolved soul,so that the two are the same thing(2/2021). It amazes me that the history of humankind is so pathetic and that such a race is necessary to accomplish SE's purpose.Did the SE expect this?Or is this all part of It knowing Itself? Everything that happens within the multiverse is a function of the Source giving us all free range to do what we want to do.In doing so,it is getting a multipolous way of experiencing things concurrently.Even when we're doing things that we feel are wrong or inappropriate or inefficient,we're creating the ability to have a complete level of experience,therefore,a complete depth of experience,which gives a complete high quality of evolutionary progression. Although it seems that humankind is being pathetic in its learning ability to respect and love each other,the process that we're going through gives us a depth of experience,which is giving it a holisticlevel of understanding,a holistic level of experiential progression,a holistic knowledge base and a holistic level of evolution,which we wouldn't be doing,if we all wanted to experience only the "good"side. The benefit of the Source letting everything happen is that everything does happen,whereas if it controlled it,it would be controlled.A controlled situation is a slow way of evolving.Letting things happen randomly,which is a function of us having our own individualized free will or not-when we're in other areas of the physical universe or in the energetic-allows us to experience things in a complete way concurrently rather than doing things in the preferred way. Doing things in a preferred way is fine when we start to understand how to incarnate and how to navigate around incarnation at a level that allows us to do what we need to do and get out.But until we can do that, we're experiencing things in a way,which appears to be completely random or sometimes inappropriate or not liked or loved,but it's allowing us to experience it holistically. That's what Source wants.That's what Origin wants.It wants to have everything,not just the good bits and certainly not just the bad bits.It wants everything(5/2021). When operating in the physical plane,what is the best we can do without doing too much or too little?Does everybody get the same amount of evolutionary content whether we are the protagonist or antagonist? How do we do too much or too little?The Buddhists have a very good way of describing this and that is let's take the middle way.That is do what you can do in an efficient and robust and accurate way and do it at depth.Don't do at surface level.Don't do lots of stuff at surface level. What do you achieve by that?You achieve lots of stuff at surface level. You don't get depth and detail surrounding smaller amounts or parts. So just doing enough to allow to do what you're doing in detail is the way forwards.Choose the middle road.Don't do too much.Don't do too little.But whatever you do,do it well and do it for Source(7/2021). Does it matter what role we play,for example,"good guy"or "bad guy?" It depends upon what the life plan is and what is expected to be gained from a particular role.So that's not quite quantifiable in terms of equality.If we choose a role of a protagonist in a particular incarnation, then we will learn from that,because being a bad guy is definitely not the same as being a good guy.Each of them will have their own aspects of learning,experience and evolution associated with that. You might in one incarnation get more evolutionary progression as a so-called "bad guy"and then go vice versa in the next incarnation as a "good guy."So it just depends upon the depth of expectation or the plan for the particular incarnation and how we interact with that role as to the level of evolutionary progression we get(7/2021).

### Free Will 

There are two types of free will that entities in our physical universe may have.Humans have individualized free will,which means they can make decisions on their own without considering the impact of their decisions on others.All other galactic races have collective free will,which means they stay connected to each other and make decisions as a group,not individually. How much ofour life is preprogrammed vs.choice? We have a choice to change anything that is supposedly predestined. Clearly,we are able to change the future,because the future doesn't exist,it's now.If what have laid down in our life plan before we incarnate is in front of us and the experience is presented to us in the form of certain levels of pain,then that "suffering"(if you want to call it that)is what we're supposed to experience in this particular lifetime. You could also identify it as being predestined,therefore,it's there to be experienced and it won't change no matter what we do.However,if we have the opportunity to change the direction,because we may have experienced or understood the effect of or the underlying reason for a certain experience before we get to that point of profound level of experience that could be classified as suffering,then we can move on from that before we get to the enhanced level of experience. It's a little bit like if you spill a paint pot on your stairs.If you pick up the paint pot right away,you only have the one stair to clean up.You've only experienced a small amount of pain to clean it up.But if you leave that paint pot to drip down the rest of the stairs,then you've got the enhanced suffering of having to clean up all the stairs. If we react fast enough,we can constrain the effect of that potential pre-destiny.If we learn early enough and accept that learning,then we don't need to go into greater intensity later.The faster we react or respond to what is being presented to us,the less we experience the potential suffering later(7/2013). What about being proactive vs.reactive? If we do nothing and we have the opportunity to something,then it will hit us harder later,whereas if we reacted straight away,then we'd be okay. For example,if you know your car uses water and you consistently top it up with water,then your car will not fail on you.But if you don't top up the radiator with water,then your car will overheat and break down on you.Normally,you're caught in some situation,like in the middle of the freeway.So it's very much about being proactive,spotting and working with what's there in the moment.You can only really spot this,if you're being more aware and awake and observant as well (7/2013). Is our individualized free will the result of poor communication with our True Energetic Self (vertical)or poor collective consciousness with other humans (horizontal)? The answer to that is it's part of it,but it's not all of it.Individualized free will is something that we're given as a function of the allowable functionality of the incarnate vehicle and the soul that integrates with it.Generally,most incarnate vehicles throughout the physical universe are operating in some form of collective consciousness.There's various different forms of collective consciousness,as explained in The Origin Speaksand The Anne Dialogues. We have individualized free will,because we become individualized as a function of the lower frequencies.When we incarnate into a vehicle that's lower frequency,that augments that free will,because we're not thinking in terms of everybody else,we're thinking in terms of ourselves. Notice that when we work with other beings that are higher frequency and we're higher frequency,we start to think of each other collectively. We work for each other.We are of service to each other.That's thinking in a more collective way.You can say that as we evolve in some way,shape or form,we think more collectively than we do as individuals.That's a bit of a clue there,because we are actually a collection of individualized sentient energies separated from our creator,the Source(7/2016). How is individualized free will going to be given to other entities higher up in the physical universe,when they already have more connectivity with their collective and their True Energetic Self?How does it really work for us and them at higher frequencies? The higher up the frequencies we go,we collectively have our own free will and we have individually our own free will.But as we become more evolved through work in higher frequencies,unless there is a specific piece of experience we need to have,we generally tend to work together rather than individually. Working individually and having individual will to the detriment of others is based upon separation.It's based upon being disconnected. But when we move up the frequencies,we become more connected and we start to realize who and what we are.We start to realize we're part of a much bigger collection of entities,so we start to work in a collective sense. We start to be of service to people.We start to think of others before ourselves.We lay our own lives down before others as well.Even though there are entities that clearly have their own free will in the rest of the higher frequencies,they don't use it that way.They use it in a collective sense. But the entities that we are involved with here that are operating in the first three and maybe the fourth frequency are the ones that are definitely not given free will.They're operating in a collective sense, because you can see how destructive that free will can be,if used incorrectly.It takes a long time to reverse the trend of being selfish, materialistic,antagonistic and medieval,so to speak. But those entities that are higher up the frequencies at 7th,8th and 9th frequency,even though they have free will,they all operate collectively,because that's what they are.We're ultimately a collection of sentience that's been given individuality for a moment(7/2016). You said that unless we can master individualized free will,other incarnating souls will not be given individualized free will to accelerate their evolution.Is this the first time we have individualized free will?Did we have it in the previous two multiverse cycles? Individualized free will is a function of this particular evolutionary cycle and it's only a recent addition to the evolutionary cycle.It's only in the last million or so years where it has been used or introduced into this particular location within the physical universe. It's a unique thing in all sorts of ways and it has various different evolutionary opportunities,which were discussed at a higher level. One of the effects of giving ourselves individualized free will is that we could drop down the frequencies,but we could also go up the frequencies and become something much bigger and much better. The issue is that we are currently dropping down.But we have the capability to stop this drop and benefit from experiencing lower frequency thoughts,behaviors and actions and apply governance of ourselves whilst incarnate to ensure that we don't go down these levels again.We learn and subsequently evolve from being in the lower levels,because we can see how difficult it is and how damaging it can be to others,who incarnate in the environment around us(7/2018). Is individualized free will only given to fully sentient human souls, not to backfill or animal,plant or minerallevel entities? The only other souls that are allowed to have individualized free will are the backfill people that have the quality of sentience that is in between the human and the animal.They are only a recent inclusion, even more recent than having individualized free will.The backfill people have only been here no more than 50-60+years. They are allowed to incarnate here to allow those of higher quality of sentience to ascend into the higher frequencies whilst still being on Earth.They're here to help us.They will also benefit from the ability to incarnate and have individualized free will,so eventually they will evolve as well(7/2018). When humans incarnate on higher frequency "New Earths,"do we still have individualized free will at FB 4,FB 5 up to FB 12 as an experiment in self-responsibility?Or will we function as a group mind,like galactic races operating as separately together collectives? As we ascend the frequencies and go through the different frequencies associated with the Earth,our individual consciousness becomes more connected,so to speak.The sentience is able to access higher levels of communicative ability with the True Energetic Self and we gain access to higher functions.But more importantly,we would still maintain our individualized free will.The more we work on ourselves,the more we justify individualized free will,so it will be with us all the way through the different frequency bands-that's if we are incarnate on the Earth. If we decided at some point collectively through incarnation that we prefer to be working in a communal or collective sense,then we will do.But that would be part of our individualized free will,so we'd still have individualized free will,but that free will would be individually directed towards working with every other incarnate entity that has individualized free will for the benefit of the whole collective of incarnate entities rather than for the benefit of the one.That's a more evolved level. So we may go to a point,where we have a more group mind,but that will only be a function of us moving through the frequencies and becoming more connected with each other-more intuitively and telepathically connected-so we'll start to operate more as one body rather than lots of little bodies of sentience.Going up the frequencies will by default make us more directed towards working as a collective, although we'll still have individualized free will. Other entities within the physical universe have different types of will -collective will,hive-like mind will or individualized sentience whilst still having collective will as well.The Earth is one way we're experiencing,learning and evolving through individualized free will, but the other incarnate vehicles that we use have different types of will -more collective will associated to them. Individualized free will is reserved for the Earth. When it becomes obvious that through individualized free will,we start to think,behave and act in a way,which is concurrent with higher frequency existence,then it's going to be seen that individualized free will is a powerful vehicle for evolutionary progression. Then it will be disseminated through the other vehicles that are in the physical universe as well.They will all have individualized free will as well,but that will be quite a long way away (8/2018). Do the collectives and councils get bigger when they operate at higher frequencies? In general,any councils or alliances that are made within the rest of the physical universe are made through the understanding that collectivity works.It works for the benefit of the individual and it works for the benefit of the collective. Collectives will work with other collectives and they will work in ways of governance that are associated with one collective working with another collective.But that on Earth hasn't happened yet and it will happen later,much,much later.But that will be when we realize that we can work individually but together.We will be collectively together but individually collectively together as well(8/2018). In The Anne Dialogues you said that there are various other forms of free will that include various forms of collectivity as part of its functionality?What does this mean? There are different forms of free will.There's different forms of collective free will.Totally individualized free will is what we're experiencing now.But there's other forms of free will that are not totally collective that are assigned to a collective. One example of almost total free will is where you have individualized free will,but you're governed upon how your actions and responses affect the rest of the collective.So you would naturally have laws within you that said,"Okay,if I do this,this is going to affect other individuals in this way,so therefore,maybe I'll do it in a different way where it doesn't affect them too much."That's what the higher end of free will within a collective is like. Other levels of free will would be where you're able to work in a free will way in a very limited context,that allows you to do the work you need to do on behalf of the collective,but only in a way that is effective for the collective.To use the example of the human body,if you're a liver cell,you can do everything that you want to do as a liver cell but nothing more,whereas if you are a brain cell,you have the ability to do whatever a brain cell does but nothing more.That's the idea. But if you have a different level of free will,like a cancer cell,you can create yourself to be a liver cell,but not quite perform like a liver cell. That performance may be good enough to confuse the liver cells and the white blood cells and the body's immune system to make it think that you're a liver cell but you're not.That's a little bit of free will that's just outside of the total collective condition.So there's different types of free will.The ways we incarnate in various different parts of the physical universe also dictate what level of will we have(11/2018). You wrote:"Not all Aspects that are projected away from the main body of TES energies have free will."How could an aspect on Earth be without free will? When an aspect is projected away from the True Energetic Self to incarnate in a different location within the physical universe at a different frequency and in a different planetary or galactic location, they would not have individualized free will. There are other entities among us that don't have total free will, including the animalaspects projected from their True Energetic Selves that don't have the same quality of sentience that our TES has.Animals don't have the same level of free will that we do.Other entities that don't have free will at all include the sentient entities that have incarnated at a higher frequency on the Earth that we can't see.They have no free will at all,because they are part of a collective(11/2018). Source tells us that there are approximately 415,000 races of beings that have free will singularly or collectively.How many in/on the Earth?How many in our solar system? When the Source said that,it said there's a level of free will,but the singular free will is also allowed to go to collectivity or a hive based condition of working together.In this instance,individualized free will does not refer to 415,000 races where the individual is totally able to do whatever they want to irrespective of how it affects another.This doesn't happen in the rest of the physical universe,it only happens here on Earth. On the Earth,there's only the human race that has individualized free will.There's another race that is higher frequency that exists within some part of the Earth and the souls that are incarnating in the dolphin form.They have individualized free will,but also on a collective basis. So two of the incarnate entities-one of a higher frequency and the dolphin form-do have individualized free will,but they are still linked into the need to work in a collective fashion.So although they've got individualized free will,that individualized free will,if it was used to a detrimental effect with any other individual or function of the collective,they wouldn't be allowed to do so,because there's a natural inhibitor there. Think of it in terms of Isaac Asimov's Three Robot Laws in Handbook of Robotics,2058 4.D.,as to how an individual with free will who works with the collective is allowed to work.I'm just being told that where do you think Asimov got those laws from?He was given them based upon how most incarnate aspects operate who have individualized free will, but are part of a collective (8/2019).

Source said once we reach the 4th universe(15th frequency),we can choose to have free will individualized instead of various collective consciousness?Please explain. It's a natural function of going up the frequencies that once we get to a certain level of understanding and interaction with other entities of higher frequencies-whether they're incarnate or disincarnate-that we'll start to work in a more collective consciousness way rather than individualized consciousness way.The whole point of individualized free will is for us to experience,learn and evolve what it means to be totally individualized and totally isolated or separated whilst still being able to work together. But when we start to realize that the whole point of being individualized is just another gateway to becoming more of a collective consciousness or not just working for ourselves,but working for the benefit of others,then we start to work in a collective way.As we become more capable of reaching higher frequencies whilst incarnate, we will seek communion more actively as a result of it,because we will want to work with each other on a more profound level for the benefit of each other. What's happening in the 4th universe (15th frequency)is that it's a disincarnate or energetic condition.Most individuals at that level are working in a collective way anyway,because they are higher frequency and they've got more connectivity,more inclusivity and are more collectively conscious as well(1/2020). As our level ofawareness increases,we start to be able to tap into our higher functions.But it could be harmful to others,if we are not careful and use them with conscience.Is it best not to use them or are we allowed to use them in whatever ways we wish? Yes,those who are a higher frequency and do have the functions tend to be very careful about how they use their function.The physical functionality,such as telekinesis,other things like creativity,coercion and control of others tend to be shunned,because they could end up being karmic,because they would create an ego to command and control other individuals. If you were able to perform telekinesis or levitation or that sort of stuff in public,you would show it's a function that happens.But then you probably would find yourself in a bit of media circus.You may end up being in some sort of a magic circuit doing that,so that would feed your ego and the ego would take over giving you a karmic link with the Earth. So many people who are very evolved and have this ability shun it. They don't use it,they just maintain things like connectivity with the Source or even the Origin and try to find some way of helping others in a way which doesn't create attachment to them. Clearly,there are others who do have skills or functions associated with being a higher frequency entity and they do abuse them.For example,there are some within the ///uminati who are in that level. They have the ability to do various different things,because they're at a certain level of evolutionary progression,and therefore,able to tap into certain frequential levels or they've trained to do certain things. But they use it in an unpure way.If you want to call it going to the "dark side,"that's one way of thinking about it.But they do enough to maintain their frequency level,so they can continue to do their function or whatever they're doing in a detrimental way and they find some way of shielding themselves.But that's part of free will. It's a bit like if you knew how to be a surgeon and you use that skill to save people's lives,that's one way of looking at it.If you're a surgeon and you use it to butcher people,that's another way of looking at it.So what you've got is the ability to choose between what is an evolutionarily progressive way of using your skill vs.one which is creating a karmic link and is associating you with the gross physical. That is another way of looking at it(8/2020). Origin and the Source Entities have free will that seems to be different than our free will?Do they have an oversoul or a guide to reason out their actions? The Origin and the Source Entities are autonomous.The Source Entities have full autonomy within the Origin and the Origin has its own autonomy of its own.There are no guides for those levels of entity. The Origin also experiences its own parallel conditions,but there's no guide for the Origin.The Source Entities work on their own in an autonomous way within the environment of the Origin's polyomniscient sentient self-awareness without guides as well (6/2018). It seems that there are three types of free will,Origin free will,Source Entities free will and ours.How is our free will different? The Origin and the Source Entities have their own autonomous free will of different levels of functionality,ability and power.We have individualized free will only when we're incarnate on the Earth and that is relevant to our abilities and evolution whilst incarnate here (6/2018). It seems that everything else is a collective free will based on a group consciousness. That's correct,because the Earth is a very important experiment in giving the individualized aspects or shards individualized free will (6/2018). It is very cool that we are here with seemingly total free will and it seems obvious that as a result we have a greater opportunity to grow, to experience and to evolve. We do and this is why we are masters of our own environment really. As a result,we all have full responsibility for our actions.We can do anything we want to,provided we are prepared to pay the consequences-the karmic content associated with being at these low frequencies. What we have to understand is that unless we can master individualized free will,other incarnating souls will not be able to enjoy this level of potentially accelerating our evolutionary progression by having free will in the physical universe,which has the lowest frequencies associated with the multiversal environment (6/2018).

### Guides 

This refers to the True Energetic Selves that are on the service path and become spirit guides or helpers to assist those of us on the evolutionary path with both material and spiritual skills. Is the agreement to be a guide or a helper for an aspect made at the aspect level or at the True Energetic Selflevel?Who's in charge? A guide is usually a True Energetic Self (TES),but they do have the ability to use aspects the same way our TES does as well.The TES is given the opportunity to enter into the evolutionary cycle(like us)or to be of service,so it can choose to be a helper or a guide.This agreement is made at the very start of the evolutionary cycle where we are given the opportunity to learn,experience and evolve in various ways.We decide which route we're going to take,whether we're going to be a guide or a helper or an entity that's going through the evolutionary cycle. There are various different levels of guides,so there's a hierarchy depending upon how that particular entity evolves as a result of being in service.If they're in service,they can't earn their own evolutionary content,but they do gain evolutionary content as a result of evolution, which is donated or given to them by their "wards"or the entities that they're looking after that are going through the evolutionary cycle (11/2015). So they are not incarnate? A guide and a helper can incarnate,but they only do it for a very short period of time.They will come and see how we're reacting to their little commands,their nudges,their gifts of intuition or gut feeling about what to do,which corners to go around,which experience to experience and in what order to experience it in. They can potentially function like the entities we call "angels"and "archangels"and cherubs and other descriptions in religious teachings who in reality are maintenance entities(Curators). What we call a "guardian angel"is actually a helper or a main guide that looks after us.The role of the guide is agreed upon at the very start of the cycle,so they can function like angels.But the entities we call angels have a completely different role and job to do in terms of maintaining the multiversal environment both within and without the structure associated with it (11/2015). Do the guides come from the same or higher level of the multiverse as our TES,but never lower? They do exist in a higher level,but they exist outside of the structure. My understanding is that they are able to move within and without the structure to do what they need to do.Generally,a guide is looking after more than one incarnate entity ("ward"),so they need to be able to work with their wards in all levels.That includes all the event spaces created by the incarnate entities,so they have to work with not only the mainstream or main line life,but they also with the different event spaces and parallel versions or conditions created by their wards (11/2015).

Does a guide usually guide more than one aspect at a time?Or are they too busy guiding all the parallel incarnate selves of a single aspect? It's interesting,because they can still work with one or work with many.It depends on their own progression.They don't actively seek evolutionary content,but they do receive it as a result of the gratitude of those individuals (wards)that they've looked after by donating or almost giving an "evolutionary tip,"so to speak,to the guides. So the guides can evolve much faster and do evolve much faster almost by default as a result of looking after more than one ward that is being part of the cycle to help towards the evolutionary progression of our creator (Source)and the Origin as well(11/2015). How many different guides and helpers does each aspect have in one lifetime?What about across all their lifetimes,given the guides may be used more than once? Generally,they have one guide and a number of helpers,depending upon the life plan they've created,the type of experience they want to experience and whether they need a number of helpers with "specialism"based upon the experiences that the aspect wanted to experience.The guide will have the ability to orchestrate a number of different helpers. It can go from one helper up to any number of helpers.The highest number of helpers that I have been aware of for some of my clients is around the mid 60s.Sometimes these helpers can fluctuate in numbers depending upon the amount of work and the importance of that work that they're undertaking with their ward. In the standard condition,they only have one guide,but they can have a lot of different helpers,for instance,24 helpers throughout one incarnation.In one case,I noticed that an aspect's True Energetic Self had moved from one frequency level to another,which is like a "frequential promotion"for the TES.As a result,the aspect didn't have a guide at first,because it had moved on,because the TES had moved to the next level.A new guide was being sought to help that aspect along with the other aspects that their TES had projected into various parts of the multiverse.They needed new guides to take them further,so the guides are a little bit like a school teacher. When we enter school in our 5th or 6th year of life,we have teachers that take us up to a certain age.When they've taught us all they're trained to teach and we've reached that level of capability,then another teacher comes down from a higher level and works with us to bring us up to their level of understanding or education.When we've reached that,then another teacher comes and takes us to a new level.We progress from kindergarten to junior school,secondary education,and then into university education. It's also possible to have a swap of guides.For instance,when a person was asking for a new guide to come in,it was an assistant guide rather than a main guide.That assistant guide was an entity who had taken a little bit longer to evolve as a result of being of service,because the evolution they gain is not gained directly,it's going through the gratitude of the aspects that enter into the evolutionary cycle.The assistant guide was asking permission to help out and be part of the orchestration or guidance of that person.

But generally,we only have one guide and the number of helpers relevant and needed to support to the life plan(11/2015). What about across all their lifetimes,given the guides may be used more than once? One of the things I give in my readings is the number of times the person has used the guide or had a relationship with.It can go from one to two times to thousands of lives.Some people naturally progress from one guide to another guide,as they evolve in the same way we go through different teachers,as we go through the education process. But a few souls have used the same guide through all of their incarnations or at least all of their Earth-based incarnations.It's to do with the evolutionary level of the aspect,but more importantly the evolutionary level of the TES itself rather than the aspect.The aspect is working on behalf of the TES to experience things in a concurrent way of experiencing evolution(11/2015). Does it depend on the lifetime counts or the evolutionary level of the aspect? Bear in mind that once we've moved up to a certain level,which is around the end of the fifth full dimension,we can elect not to enter into the incarnate cycle within any of the frequencies associated with the physical universe.Therefore,we can progress purely energetically rather than projecting ourselves down towards a physical vehicle to incarnate. I'm being told that if we were to change our guide for every frequency we move up,as part of our evolutionary progression and this is the same as experiencing every particular universe in the multiversal structure,then we could experience 397 different guides throughout our cycle.But that's not specifically true,because some souls have a really long term relationship with their guide,so it's quite possible that a particular aspect may keep their guide from start to finish,so they have one guide. It's also possible that an aspect could change guides every time their TES changes their frequency level,so then it could have 397 guides or they can choose to change them midstream once they've moved through a quarter or a half or an eighth of a particular frequency level. There's no real rules on this,it's just how the TES working with its aspects chooses to work with the TESs that enter into service as guides (11/2015) Do guides specialize in guiding certain types of incarnations (e.g. healing,leadership,planetary work,etc.)? Rather than the guides specializing,it tends to be the helvers that specialize.The helpers gain specialism based upon the type of service work they do with various different aspects whilst they're working with them The guides do have a structure or a hierarchy of sorts with master guides who have the ability to look after a number of different guides under them.That creates a certain level of specialism at the guide level, but it's the helpers that specialize in the detail surrounding healing work,planetary work,leadership,etc.

An incarnate aspect can choose to use the same helpers incarnation after incarnation,if they feel comfortable with them.If they're getting good service from them and feel that they're able to respond to them and notice the little nudges or gut feelings or desires or intentions or needs that are not part of the normal thought process or existence,that are little changes in direction that our guides and helpers are giving us, then we may work with them again.It all depends on how well we work with them (11/2015). Is the agreement to guide as much about the evolution of the guide as the incarnate? When it comes to the performance review at the end of an incarnation (described in The Anne Dialogues),there's a lot of information discussed between the incarnate aspect,the TES of the aspect,the guide and helpers that are working with it and the TESs of the helpers and the guides. The guide and helpers don't enter into service to try to gain evolutionary content.Their progression is a consequence of the aspect being grateful for them or recognizing the work that the guide and helpers have done.Thus,the aspect may donate a percentage of the evolutionary content gained as a result of that incarnation to that guide and helpers. In our case,we have a natural tendency to want to enter into the evolutionary cycle to assist our Source to evolve in the fastest way possible,while they have a natural tendency to want to be of service, because they can evolve in a different way or in an accelerated way.The role of the guides and helpers is to help us incarnate and gain that evolutionary content in as fast and efficient way as possible,so that the evolutionary cycle itself can be shortened. As described in The Oriein Speaks,this is not our first multiverse cycle. We've been through two other cycles before this one,so this is our third evolutionary cycle.This cycle has accelerated extremely quickly in comparison to the first two cycles.It's a function of how well we've worked previously with our guides and helpers as to how fast we can evolve in this cycle and how fast the guides and helpers can evolve from our evolutionary content donated to them(1/2015). Are the guides actively seeking to contact and awaken people at this time? Their role is for us to evolve as fast as possible and to maximize the effect of being incarnate.They can make sure that our incarnation is as efficient as possible and that we gain as much evolutionary content as possible,which allows us to move up the frequencies while incarnate. That will result in us awakening as well,so the whole thing is an upward spiral. They are actively seeking to help us evolve in an accelerated way whilst we are incarnate.That results in us becoming more aware and awake, as we get access to the functionality associated with higher frequencies within the physical universe.You could argue that the whole thing points to getting us all away as fast as possible,because then this mass ascension that we would like to see will become an actuality rather than an individualized ascension.It will be a massive group ascension.This is what the whole spiritual paradigm is working towards.

It seems to be happening a lot in my circles and I have no doubt that everybody participating in this Satsanga and those who'll be listening will agree.What's generally happening is that we're starting to become more awake and aware of how we should be behaving as an evolved civilization-irrespective of whether we're able to know that we are part of something much bigger,that our soul or aspect is part of a larger group of sentient energies called our True Energetic Self(Higher Self,Oversoul,Godhead),which is evolving. Everything that's happening now is pointing towards us recognizing that the way that some of us interface with each other-whether we call them atrocities,whether we cause mass deaths or terrorism is a way of waking some of us up.It's making us all think in a different way. Some of us think in terms of support for these things and most of us think otherwise.The whole point is to help us think together in a common way with enough focus.That focus will assist in us having some level of group ascension and the triangulation effect associated with that (11/2015). In the "no-time"environment where our guides exist,how do they know at what precise interval of our "time"to interact with us?What kind of "non-temporal structure"do they use to connect the continuous "now"with our reality? If we go back to the structure of event space,where everything is existing concurrently and is in either direct or indirect contact with each other through contact of event spaces together,then everything is existing concurrently.There is no future,there is no past.There is no beginning,there is no end.There is just now. From our human perspective,because we're incarnate in these lower frequencies,we've lost the ability to be in this state of awareness and interaction with this totally no-time environment-this everywhere and everything at once environment. Whilst we're experiencing linearity here,because of these low frequencies,our guides and helpers can experience everything that we've done,can do,should do,may do and will do all at the same time. They see it all happening and just dip in to a certain juncture of same "timeness"and work with that level of concurrency.They know that everything happens concurrently for them,but in a linear function for us.So they just work with the right juncture of concurrence that links in with our linear expression or linear experience of this total concurrence (4/2016). What are the"Guides"on the astral level,such as relatives that have passed on who try to help their loved ones still in the physical?Some seem to group together (e.g.grandmother,uncle,father,etc.)on the Other Side to guide the loved ones they left behind. Okay,very quickly I'm going to say that sometimes our guides and helperstake the form of those individuals who we were interacting with in a family scenario or loved one scenario or friendship scenario, because it's something that we can relate to in our limited understanding and limited level of expansiveness. So although it may look like a grandmother or a father or an uncle or a brother or a deceased partner that's helping us,it's more likely to be one of our helpers who is manifesting a form in our minds to create a link or a bridge between them and us to help us move forwards. There are times when those individuals do actually help us.But normally that's quite rare.They've got their own things to do and they move on.The only time that they may interact with us is after their physical body demises and they want to let us know that they are okay. When my wife (Anne)ascended and died,she created a signal for me to let me know that she was okay.It was a little electronic gadget to open beer bottles,which would play a Christmas tune when used.It had been hidden away for a long time.When I meditated on Anne seven hours after her human form had demised,I said,"Okay,where is this message you were going to give me?"This gadget sounded off a couple of times and three or four times later in the day as well. It wouldn't play a tune without metal to metal contact between the bottle and the gadget.That was her signal to me.Sometimes they do help out just to let us know that they're okay.Very,very rarely do they stick around,because usually the guide and helpers help us.They are just using their forms and/or their energetic signatures to make the level of communication more robust with us(4/2018). Are these relatives still on the astral plane (FB 4-7),meaning are their souls in transit,because they're doing an "astral detour"to help their loved ones from the Other Side? Yes,those that stay on those levels tend to be individuals who do want to stay for a little bit.But it's generally not the case,they move on.It can also be those souls who get stuck.Getting stuck on these levels is only a temporary thing,because their guide and helpers usually move them on as quickly as they can do.But some individuals do reject the fact that their human form has died,so they try to maintain a link with the Earth. They stick around these astral levels at frequency bands 4-7,which are called the lower astral (FB 4),upper lower astral (FB 5),lower upper astral (FB 6)and upper astral (FB 7)levels.So they do sometimes stick around,but it's usually not for long-usually to give a message or if they are so immersed in their incarnation that they believe they're alive even though their body has died(4/2018). Or are their souls already doing their life review at their True Energetic Self level?Are they able to project a familiar "personality" to the astral plane to help a loved one? That's a possibility as well.That does sometimes happen.It's more likely that they've moved on.They're in the condition where they're individualized still and communing with the bigger part of themselves, which is the True Energetic Self.They are experiencing communion as well as reviewing what's been experienced. If it's beneficial to the individual who is still incarnate to experience some connectivity,then that may well happen,if it's beneficial and helps them move on to work with their own life plan (4/2018). Or is it a soul that is projected outside of the True Energetic Self in back-to-back lives? That can happen as well.That's a possibility.It's worthwhile noting that the True Energetic Self can allow transient sort of communication of that aspect that was projected into a physical form at any point.It can be in any of the different types of communion or if it's kept outside of the energies of the True Energetic Self,because that aspect is being used in back-to-back lives as well. Even if it's in full communion,if it's felt that it's necessary or if there's a request or a requirement from the other incarnate aspect via its own True Energetic Self to give it a push in some way or give it some encouragement in some way,then there will be a level of minor interaction.That can be from any of the different types of communion with the TES. If you look on my website,www.beyondthesource.org,go into Events and Lectures,you'll see a lecture called "Who We Are and How We Incarnate"to see the different types of communion we can have with our TES after we come back from an incarnation(4/2018). Or is it a new incarnation only at a higher frequency level to act as a guide before the True Energetic Self gradually pulls itself out of the physical universe altogether? No.Generally,the True Energetic Selves are still working with the physical universe.There's not too many individuals whose True Energetic Self is in a position of deciding not to incarnate in the physical universe yet(4/2018). I'm asking this,because some of the dead relatives seem to have a "snarky"personality shortly after death,but they also seem to "mature"or evolve or become wiser and more expansive the more time they spend on the Other Side? The answer to that is they do become more mature and evolve,because they become more absorbed in or have some level of increased communion with their True Energetic Self.Even before they go into communion,they start to gain access again to everything that they've achieved or experienced in previous incarnations and the incarnations of other aspects of their True Energetic Self.So they definitely become more evolved or wiser,because they no longer have the limitations of what is being created as a function of their human incarnation. From that perspective,when you see a soul go from being a low intelligence type individual and then if some medium communicates with them,they become a very wise and benevolent entity,then you know that the personality,that was a function of the ego created by incarnation,is being wiped away.It is being supported and replaced by the vast level of experience and evolution that the soul normally has. That's why they become wiser on the Other Side,because they're more in communication with who and what they really are.They're more interactive with their TES and they're more interactive with the environment around them(4/2018). You said the Ego dissolves when the body dies,but it seems that some of the human "personality"or quirks are still with them on the Other Side shortly after death.Is that coming from the remnants of the ego's lower personality? No.The ego is created as a function of the near total isolation of the incarnate Aspect from the True Energetic Self.That sentient energy that's projected into the human or other vehicle starts to gain a personality and starts to believe it's the vehicle.The personality is created as a function of incarnation and interaction with parents, colleagues,friends,loved ones and the environment.It does dissolve as a function of the demise of the human form. But the content of the personality is also absorbed,because it's part of the overall experience.So even though the ego is created and dissolved, what's really dissolved is the ego's ability to command and control the sentience.The ego is no longer the dominating factor of who and what that incarnate aspect is.However,it is used as a bridge between those who are disincarnate and those who are incarnate,because otherwise how would you recognize that soul? If somebody wants to communicate with a deceased relative or a deceased partner,they would not recognize who that partner was,if it came through a trance medium unless the personality that they recognize as being that person is used as a communication medium. They use it sometimes as a means of communication and recognition (4/2018). When does that lower personality get completely disassociated from the soul?Is it only after the soul partially or fully reintegrates with its True Energetic Self? The moment we move our aspect(soul)out of the incarnate state and it becomes energetic,the personality of the ego loses its grip on the command and control of the aspect of sentienceused in the incarnation. It gets absorbed as part of the overall experience,but it's not what the aspect is or what the True Energetic Self is.It's just a smaller function of it.It's a smaller temporary personality that's been created,so it becomes resorbed almost straightaway. The feeling that the aspect gets is that the personality that's part of itself becomes like a small drop in the ocean and the bigger personality takes over,so all the memories of experiences,learning and evolution associated with previous incarnations and other evolutionary cycles all comes back into the sentience of that aspect that was temporarily individualized. When we go into the different levels of communion,the levels of sentience and experiences associated with the aspect start to then collate or blend into all of the experiences of the other aspects(true soul mates)associated with that True Energetic Self and the work that the TES does in its own right.So basically everything is absorbed later, although the total experience of the aspect comes to the forefront almost straightaway(4/2018). Thanks for your insight.It's a bit like your work with your late wife (Anne)after her demise.Some ofher comments in The Anne Dialogues are pretty funny! Yes,Anne was a little bit frustrated by my questions at some point and some of the simplicity of the questions,but this is sometimes how it vorks(4/2018). All through my life I was told that my guiding Angel,because of free will,would stand by and not offer assistance or help unless I ask for it.If I did not ask a guiding Angel to help me,it would stand there watching.Is this true?

Well,the guardian angel is really your main guide and the word"angel" (or angelic)is an old English or old European word to explain something,which is magnificent when observed.It's just our inability to understand the energies that are emanating from them when they manifest a form to be able to work with this low frequency environment. They're always there working with us.We're always able to communicate with our guide and our helpers.I always tell people to just meditate on the guide and ask for help or direction and guidance. Don't just believe it.Know it and then you'll get the information in one or more modalities. For instance,it can be from a clairvoyant perspective where you may see things in your mind's eye.It can be clairaudience or hearing things in your mind's ear or clairsentience,which is just a knowingness (or claircognizance).It can also come through guidance or images through dreams.It can come through different things being said to us by family,friends,work colleagues and even the things we see on TV or everything that's happening around us,like reading a paper. Sometimes they can give us the information we want or point us in the right direction by using the media that we use metaphysically and physically (e.g.internet)around us.It's simply a case of meditating and knowing you can contact them(7/2018). I often have dialogues with the spirit world and when reviewing my day,I feel disappointed for not asking for help with difficult situations.Who should we ask for help-our friends,Higher Self, Guide,Helpers,Source Entity or Origin? I would suggest that you work on your main guides first.The main guides are the ones that are closely connected to you.Clearly,Source is as well,but the main guide and the helpers are those who are experts in you as an individual.They know what you've experienced in previous incarnations. They know what you've brought into this incarnation in terms of your desires for evolutionary progression and your skill set that help you achieve them.They also are skilled in the experiences that you haven't had in previous incarnations that you're going to have in this particular incarnation,so they are there to help in every shape,way and form. The best thing to do is to meditate on the guide and helpers that are linked in with you,so that you can move forwards in a more robust way,because they're there for you.If you really do concentrate and meditate properly,you'll feel them around you anyway.They're out of sight.Some people can pick them up,if they meditate on them and raise their frequencies. One way of doing that is by using the Chakra Opening Exercises.It's a case of knowing that you can get help,but being open to all sorts of different ways in which the help can be given to us and expecting everything and nothing,because sometimes it can take a little bit longer.Sometimes the information can be instantaneous.Sometimes the information can take a couple of days or even weeks to come through.It's just being open to all functions of communication with us and being patient(7/2018).

In The Anne Dialogues you said master guides work with 12 guides and their wards and also their own 12 wards.Is that correct?If so,why do master guides get wards when they can only guide the guides? Well,sometimes master guides have newly achieved this level of responsibility,so they are still looking after their wards.A "ward"is an entity or an aspect that is incarnate.Sometimes they take on-board the governance of a ward who has a very important thing to do,and therefore,it needs to have a master guide or a guide who has lots and lots and lots of experience and ability to help that particular aspect or soul navigate through the important levels of responsibility and function it has to do in that particular incarnation(11/2018). What kind of wards do the master guides manage? Usually,it's those aspects that have a lot of important responsibilities to go through and activate through.Sometimes it can be a very,very difficult life they have to go through-the so-called "rags to riches"in terms of their intelligence or ability to change the lives of others and change the directions of others as well.So it's very important individuals usually (11/2018). Why does an aspect need multiple guides or 6 or 30 helpers?Is it about inexperience? Usually,a multiple guide condition happens only when you've got one guide handing over to another guide,if there's going to be an evolutionary jump in frequencies.The number of helpers is specific to the complexity of the incarnate's life plan.How many individuals do they need to interact with?In what environment?At what junctures within event space?Sometimes they need a lot and sometimes they need only a few helpers. There's no correlation between the overall complexity and the number of helpers.If one person has a complicated life plan,they may only need six helpers,whereas another person may have a very simple life plan with 30 helpers.You can also have somebody with a simple life plan that has six helpers and somebody with a complicated life plan who has 30 helpers.It's to do with how they want to maintain that simplicity or that complexity and how they're moving from one point to another point to interact and interface with others who are part of that life plan. Sometimes a person has to have a really simple incarnation and be kept away from the possibility of gaining karma,because they're getting close to jumping from one frequency to another.They're getting close to having an evolutionary jump or even moving away from the need to incarnate.In that case these helpers and maybe even two guides are kept really close to the goal posts associated with the glide path that is their life plan,so they don't stray.They only need to do what they need to do and that's it. That's why they might have a lot of help.Otherwise,it could be that they have not got to the juncture where they're jumping a frequency, but the life plan is simple,so they don't need a lot of individuals. There's no correlation in terms of numbers of helpers or more than one guide vs.the complexity or simplicity of the life plan(11/2018). You said the more advanced an entity is,the more evolutionary content it can accrue and donate to guides and helpers.Is this one reason for a large number of guides and helpers? No,there is no correlation between the number of guides and helpers and the ability for a particular entity to accrue more evolutionary content than another,although their guide and helpers will benefit as well.The guides and helpers aren't part of the evolutionary cycle,so they don't accrue evolution themselves per se by the work they do. But they can accrue evolution by the grateful response of a particular entity giving them evolution.It's not like an "evolutionary tax"or paying for the service saying,"Thank you for helping me,here's some evolution!"It's simply a case of,"Well,I've accrued a lot of evolution here and maybe it's more than I expected,so you can have some as well."This happens a lot.So as a function of helping multiple wards the guides and helpers can evolve sometimes faster than an individual ward can(11/2018). Do Origin and the Source Entities have a guide to reason out their actions? The Origin and the Source Entities are autonomous.The Source Entities have full autonomy within the Origin,and the Origin has its own autonomy of its own.There are no guides for those levels of entity. The Origin also experiences its own parallel conditions,but there's no guide for the Origin.The Source Entities are asked to work on their own in an autonomous way within the environment of the Origin's polyomniscient sentient self-awareness without guides as well. We have guides,because we are the ones who are involved with investigating the lowest frequencies,so we do need guiding here. When we are in the energetic,we've got thousands of senses to work with.But when we're incarnate,we're reduced to the five physical senses,so it's like we've gone blind. We need guidance to be able to experience what we want to experience in the way it's supposed to be experienced in this environment whilst interacting with other individuals that we're supposed to interact with. You can understand that we do need guiding,when we've got loss of so many different senses(6/2018). In The Anne Dialogues you said that "aspiring guides"can allow their aspects to evolve in the projected state.I thought that the whole True Energetic Self with all its aspects must become guides? This is to do with a True Energetic Self that decides to move from the evolutionary cycle into being of service as a guide.It's difficult for us as human beings to understand how something can be one thing and still be something else,but they can.Most of the time,a True Energetic Self will be totally outside of the evolutionary cycle. But there are times when the TES move from the evolutionary cycle into the service side of things by being a guide,if they've reached the level of progression where they can do it.If there's a small part of themselves (like an aspect or a shard)that is still within the evolutionary cycle,they can allow that aspect to continue its evolutionary work and come back into communion with it later. Remember that all this is a linear understanding. From a linear perspective,it would appear that the TES goes into the service side outside of the evolutionary cycle and leaves a part of itself there,so it might take a period or a number of events to allow that particular aspect to continue that work in the evolutionary cycle.But because everything exists concurrently,it's already happened. Even though it appears to be linear and the one thing is happening before an another thing or one thing appears to be out of synchronization with something else,because everything happens concurrently anyway,it's already happened.When thinking about a TES going into service but leaving part of itself behind,it's not a case of how many lives has it got to do,how many incarnations has it got to do before it can go back into the TES.Or will that part of the TES not be able to be part of that TES,because the rest of it is in service?It doesn't happen that way. It has already done that work and come back into communion with that TES.Everything happens concurrently.We think in linear terms and think that things happen separately and in an individualized way, but it's not quite the case.Things can happen and do happen all at the same time.It's just that we can't understand (12/2018). In The Anne Dialogues you said that guides and helpers use the Akashic records to validate the optimaljunctures ofinsertion and the intensity ofintervention required.How? The Akashic records are simply a memory set within the Source Entity that's associated with only those souls or aspects of the True Energetic Selves that have incarnated in the human form.It's a function of memory and it has a location within Source as well and we can access that. We can also access the other memories or records associated with the other incarnate vehicles that we've used,such as Arcturians,Sirians or other higher frequency bodies that we can incarnate into.There are lots of other records or memory sets or locations within the overall sentience and energy that the Source has got. Think of it like a chunk of memory within a wider chunk of memory that is the Source that is specifically aligned to souls or aspects that incarnate into the human form and not just on Earth.Because everything exists concurrently,it can be used by the guide and helpers to see when the optimum time to incarnate into a particular body type or family is best achieved.Although we think that we've got this individualized free will in terms of when we incarnate,there are optimal times in which to incarnate. If we think that everything has already existed,then it's like looking at a series of individual images on a reel of film and we can choose when we want to go into that incarnation.We can say,"Well,in this reel of film for this particular individual's experience,I'm going to incarnate at that point there."Or we can "walk-in"to that experience in that point or we can"walk-out"of it in this point here. It's all about creating the opportunity for us.Because everything is existing concurrently,there is no start,finish and end,so we can experience that which we've experienced tomorrow or yesterday,if you think of it from a human perspective(5/2019). Many people say they can read Akashic records.What do they access? They can read the Akashic records,because they are the concurrent accumulation of everything that has,will be,has been or is right now.

Everything exists in the Now,so there is no past,present and future. They can read everything that every particular individual has experienced. Because it's always part of Source,part of the overall memory of Source,every aspect or every True Energetic Self can experience that which every other aspect or True Energetic Self has experienced as a function of incarnation into the human form in the physical universe (5/2019) Who oversees it?Dolores Cannon said Akashic records are held in a building.Was that metaphoric or simplified for us incarnates? It's overseen by the Source,because it's a function of Source.To say it's a "building"is a simplification.It's like saying it's a sector on a hard drive.If you have a hard drive,the first thing that a computer does is it reads the addresses of where everything is,so it knows which particular sector on the hard drive a particular piece of software is that it needs to load up to make the software work. This is a similar sort of thing to think about the Akashic records.The Akashic records all exist in the same place,but you can tap into it based upon a desire to experience something based upon human experience that a certain individual has experienced,for instance. If Dolores wants to call it a building or a repository of knowledge like a library,that's fine.It's actually a sector or a location within the total memory set of the Source that is specifically aligned to human experience or incarnating in the human vehicle. It's a location where everything that has happened,will happen,could happen,should happen,has happened,may happen,will happen is happening all concurrently.Everything is happening concurrently within event space,which is "holographic,"which means everything is in one place at the same time.It's all about creating the evolutionary opportunity for us who in our individualized state and a lower frequency body aren't able to see. It's a bit like understanding the maze and getting to the center of the maze and being able to get out again.Although we understand it and know it back to front,upside down,left and right,we forget about it. We have to interact with it by experiencing certain things,like bumping into people within the maze,asking them directions,getting lost,getting found,understanding certain junctures or junctions within the maze as well.It's a case of us trying to understand it and work with it without knowledge of it. How are the Akashic records categorized? As categories go,it's just experience.They are categorized in terms of what I,the individualized aspect of my True Energetic Self,have experienced in all the different parallel conditions,all the different pasts,the different presents,the different futures.There's some parallel possibilities of those different pasts,presents and futures. They'll be categorized in terms of us and Earth and what we've experienced from those particular experiences and what we've learned from it and how we've evolved as a result of that and how that evolution has helped our True Energetic Self(5/2019). Abraham-Hicks said regression is not accurate-you don't necessarily access your own records,you could access another entity in your group or other aspects.Is this correct? Yes,I'd say that Ms.Abraham-Hicks has got it accurate there.Unless you're super accurate in what you're wanting to get out of the Akashic records,you're simply accessing the total memory set of that which has been experienced from the incarnate human perspective.That is a really accurate way of describing it-to say that regression is not accurate-and accessing it without accurate questioning isn't going to be accurate either (3/2019). There are lots of occasions,where we experience something from the Akashic records and it's like we've experienced it ourselves.It's like we've been there ourselves,but actually we haven't.It helps us work or navigate through an incarnation based upon another aspect's experience in another existence in a similar condition in a similar environment. We can actually access that which we haven't experienced,but it's associated with us,because we've downloaded it (like a "soul imprint"). We can access other things associated with other aspects as well.So unless we exactly know what we're asking or want,we can put ourselves in a position where we're just accessing things randomly and Abraham Hicks is absolutely right there(5/2019). The use of the Akashic records is useful,but you have to take it with a pinch of salt,because you have to be super accurate in what your questions are and what your intended direction of what you want to experience through the Akashic is before you can get the correct experience.You also have to understand that the experience there is not specifically going to be aligned to you as the individual or somebody else you're working with or under therapy,for instance.It is a collective series of experiences that are particular to the incarnate human condition(3/2019). What is the best way to strengthen our relationships with our guides and assistant guides and helpers?And with our True Energetic Selves,our Source Entity and Origin? Basically,meditate and listen to what they're saying to us by using our intuition.If we get a feeling about not doing something or moving in a certain way in a circumstance or an environment we find ourselves in with individuals,then we need to pay attention to that rather than using logic. Logic is the ego,but intuition is using our higher functions.If we can listen to them by using the result of our intuitive response rather than our logical response,that's the best way to help cement the relationship with them(2/2020). It has been extremely helpful for me to know the name ofmy guide. It is nice to know a name,but don't forget that when we're in the energetic,we don't have a name per se.We have a signature that's based upon our total experience and evolutionary level,so we work with that. That's how we know when we've worked with somebody before. We go like this,"Oh,I feel comfortable working with this person."You feel like you've got some deja vu with them,because you have worked with them before.You don't get that through having a name.You get that through being in their space and that's the energetic signature (2/2020). Millions of souls are moving into and out of the Earth plane,which seems like a full time job for the helpers on the Other Side.Or are these transition no different than falling asleep at night and awakening in the morning? Don't forget that our guide and helpers operate with all the parallel versions of ourselves as well in different event spaces.There's a lot of entities working in support of us who incarnate. If you've got 8 billion people just on this planet and you use the average of 25 helpers and one guide per person,then you've got 26 x 8 billion= 208 billion guides and helpers in just one event space.Then if you have the parallel versions of that,it becomes much,much bigger.So there's a much bigger cohort of entities remaining in the energetic who are helping those of us who are in the evolutionary cycle. We are evolving and helping all the other entities that aren't in the evolutionary cycle to experience,learn and evolve as well.Basically, there are many more individuals supporting those that are incarnate than those that are disincarnate.That's because of the amount of work required to make sure that those incarnate individuals experience things according to their life plan and interact with those that they're supposed to at the right point in their life plans and gain the knowledge they're supposed to gain. Sometimes they don't,but sometimes they do the best they can.The guide and helpers and their parallelized versions do a massive amount of work,which we can't see or understand from our perspective here. But they are definitely capable of doing it in the higher frequencies of the multiverse.So it's more than a full time job from our perspective, it's a massive job(4/2020). In The Carators Source said that for each and every one of us in the incarnate state,there is at least a billion others working on our behalf.Is this really the case?It's mind boggling. It's a figure of speech.If you think in terms of the number of individuals,the guide and helpers and then all of the fractalized versions of yourself,different realities,different event spaces,etc.,this is where it all comes from.On top of that we have to also include those individuals who are working with us and their guides and helpers. They're looking after other incarnate souls or aspects that have an interaction with us,because that soul benefits from their interaction with us.Although they're primarily looking after that soul,their interaction with us is beneficial to us. They're working for us and they're working for them as well.Our guide and helpers are working for us and the other souls that we interact with as well.When you look at the fractalization of the individuals we interact with and who they interact with and their interactions interact with and the interactions who interact with the interactions they interact with,you start to see how it becomes a billion easily. This is how things create this large number.Then you have the different event spaces associated with it as well and the realities within the different event streams in the different event spaces.That's how it becomes like that (10/2020). When the Earth's population was 20 billion,did the same number of helpers exist? I'm being told that when we were higher frequency entities,there wasn't the same number of guides and helpers required in terms of the hands on interaction with the other guides and helpers and other aspects or souls that were incarnating.When the Earth was 20 billion, there was a logical increase in the number of guides and helpers,but the fractalization was not the same. For example,this is not a real example,but if we had 7.5 billion,then you wouldn't get that same increase.You wouldn't get 20 billion billion,but maybe 12 billion billion,because of the higher frequencies associated with those incarnates when the population was 20 billion. There's a lot of synergies associated with being in a higher frequency that affect us in a way that creates a level of efficiency that we don't normally experience at these lower levels(10/2020). When re-reading The Origin Syeaks,I realized that you don't have a guide.If you don't have any guides,how about your late wife (Anne) and partner Celia?Do they have guides? My partner Celia does,but my late wife Anne didn't have a guide, because Anne was from the same True Energetic Self as me.There's more about this in the book about the Om.The TES of an Om is transient. Generally,only those that are in the evolutionary cycle have a guide and helpers.Those that are outside of it are very far and few between. They tend to be those who are here to assist others.They are higher frequency and may just be here-not doing anything else,but a very mundane role,such as a garage mechanic,a cook or sweeping the streets,for example,even though they can be really high frequency individuals.They don't need to have a guide,because they're evolved enough not to get involved in any karmic interactions(7/2021). Have you met anyone who doesn't have a guide beside yourself?What sort of people tend to have no guides? It's usually those entities who are outside of the evolutionary cycle that don't have a guide.For example,those incarnate maintenance entities that work with the elementals who work on the gross physical and the astral aspects of this planet and other planets,they also don't have a guide,because they're not part of the evolutionary cycle.They're in service. Any entities who are in service don't have a guide.But those entities who are in the evolutionary cycle do have a guide,because they need help.Any entity that is in the evolutionary cycle and is incarnating into a different environment with a low frequency environment needs to have a guide and helpers to help them navigate through the choices they've got to make to allow them to get to the goal post associated with their life plan (7/2021). What is the best way to interact with one's guide and helpers?Can we ask for a new guide? The guides and helpers are entities that we work with over a number of different incarnations and they take us up to certain evolutionary levels.They hand us onto other guides and helpers that take us up to different levels as well.It's quite common for the helpers to move on with us and assist a new guide who takes us up to a different level. But in terms of asking for a new guide,we tend to get the new guide when we've moved up an energetic level.We can't ask for a new guide, because we have to work with that guide.We've worked with that guide in previous incarnations and the life plan is a combined decision process between our self and our True Energetic Self and the guide and helpers.To change guides midstream is not appropriate,it's unnecessary and pretty much impossible to do. There is the odd occasion where people have two guides,because one guide is handing over to another guide or one guide is working with another guide,so we may have two guides that way.There are the very, very rare occasions,when somebody has no guide or has no helpers. That's a totally different scenario. The best way to interact with our guide is through meditation.We see ourselves communicating with our guides,asking for assistance in terms of how we would like a particular problem to be solved or guidance on how we may interact in a particular circumstance (9/2021). If a blind man was walking down a road and there was a hole in the ground,would the invisible energetic beings allow the man to fall into the hole?Or would they try and stop or prevent this upcoming accident? That depends upon whether the falling in the hole was part of the experience that the aspect in the body that has no sight has decided to experience.If falling down the hole is part of the experience,then they will fall down the hole.If not,then something will happen to negate the possibility of them falling down the hole. It may well be that somebody else will come along and guide them out of the way.It may well be that their blind walking stick spots the hole in the ground and they stop and move to the left or move to avoid it.Or it may be that they change direction suddenly or the hole in the ground has a barrier there.Or somebody else comes along and helps them.So it depends upon whether it's part of their experience,as to whether they fall in the ground or whether they're guided around that hole(9/2021).

### Holographic Space 

Holographic space is something that is all pervading and structured in a coherent and efficient way.The holographic state means that everything exists in the same space concurrently. What is the space in between space? The space in between space is two things.One is the higher structure of the Source,which is part of the higher structure of the Origin.The other is the lower substructure within the physical universe,which we understand as the atomic structure,and the space in between that can be used to move from point A to B,not only in the physical universe but in the multiverse as well(3/2014). Does the space have to increase to allow higher complexity of structure? No,the space itself is stable sizewise,but the resolution within that space changes.Think of it like a memory stick with disk space.A few years ago,we had 120 MB memory sticks,but now we have 128 GB in the same device.The space doesn't increase,but the resolution does. Our limitation is the molecular structure of silicon-the level of etching to get more information in the same area.There are various ways to increase the amount of data that we can transmit in the same space,for instance,with our radio multiplexing,data encryption and digital technology. It's the same thing with our multiverse,which has simultaneous universes at various different frequency levels (from FB 1-408).The higher the frequency,the more data it can house in that condition or environment,because of its higher "finitude"(3/2014). What about the space between the Earth and the Sun that looks empty to us? Yes,it looks empty to us,but it's actually full of something at a higher frequency.It's a bit like turning up the layers of a drawing on a CAD design where all the levels are active in the design of a car,for instance. You can choose to view everything at once (e.g.the whole car with all the levels showing the exterior,interior,paint,motor,etc.)or you can turn off certain layers,so you only see one or more levels (e.g.only seats).The more levels you turn off,the less you see. The same thing happens in our physical universe.It's like we're only seeing the body of the car.The rest of the car is still there,but it's at different levels that are "turned off"to us,because we can't perceive them with our eyes or detect them with our devices at this frequency level. When we are ascending,we'll be able to perceive more.When we start to move beyond the limitations of our mind,which is based on the limitations of our body,we'll start to detect things that are currently invisible to us at a higher frequency. Think of a new building.Right now we're seeing the basic framework of the building with steel joists.That's all we're seeing.But the gaps in between will get built with bricks,floors,insulation,electrical, plumbing,glazing,roofs,desks,chairs,etc.By luck,we're starting to see some of the things that are in the space between space,because some of our digital cameras can detect things beyond our eyes. We are starting to pick up things like orbs,ghosts or other content of the physical universe,which exists in the frequencies detected by our physical eyes.So technology is starting to see these things,but we need to progress further with that to understand more about it,like a digital camera or other equipment that is more sensitive and detects 10K or a million above where we are now(3/2014). I would like you to explain what the term"holographic"means to you in the context of event space vs.the physical universe vs.the multiverse? Basically,the physical universe and the multiverse are one and the same thing,because the physical universe is part of the multiverse,it's just part of the lower frequency function of it.Event space pervades the multiverse-it pervades everything.It pervades us.It pervades the multiverse itself,it pervades the frequencies within the multiverse. It pervades the Source,and it pervades every part of the Origin as well, so it's everywhere.It really means that these things are one and the same thing,it's just that they're different functions of the same,let's call it“space,”so“holographic”is a metaphoric statement for all- encompassing and holistic (8/2017). You said event space is a spherical and "holographic"energetic functionality.Is this similar to the "holodeck"on Star Tre (a computer program designed by the individual)? We have to use sometimes baby language to explain these things.Event space itself is all-pervading."Holographic"is a way of saying it's everywhere,but"three-dimensional"describes something that we can see as being solid,having height,width and depth.It's not a function of the actual structure of what we are,because dimensions are much higher pieces of structure than frequencies.When we use the term "three-dimensional"to explain something,it just describes solidity,so to speak. Holographic is a way of saying that everything is within everything,so wherever we are,we are still within the same thing.Even if we have this idea of the rubber band ball theory,which describes event space where the ball is event space in total and it's like a three-dimensional ball,a solid ball,it uses this solidity or occupation of space. But if you think about each event being a rubber band within the rubber band ball and each rubber band is in direct contact with each other rubber band-either directly or indirectly through other rubber bands-then you find out that everything is in contact with everything else within the same space. It's not really a function similar to the holodeck in Star Trek.It's a use of space for everything.It's something that is everywhere but in the same space.It is very difficult to explain.I think the rubber band ball is the best way to explain it.Holographic is a way of saying it is everywhere,it pervades everything(8/2017). You said the fundamental particle of matter is the Anu,which link end-to-end to form strings or rope-like structures that create the "holographic"framework for the physical universe,which is a "hard structure."Please elaborate.

The "hard structure"is a function of low frequency that creates the ability for certain energies to stick together.The very lowest function of this is the particle called the Anu.Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater were able to perceive these particles through their meditation techniques.My late father-in-law(Dennis Milner)managed to capture them through his own modifications of Kirlian photography,as described in his book,Kosmos:An Evolutionary and Wholistic Account of Creation. The frequencies being so low allows energy to stick together to create a hard structure,the first part of which is called the Anu.It allows the creation of larger structures,such as the atom.There's six levels of quanta below the atom and the Anu is the lowest level of that.This hard structure isn't "hard"as such,it's still energetic.The multiverse is energetic and the physical universe within the multiverse is energetic. It's just that its frequency is so low that it creates this sticky energy that clumps together to create "physicality." The holographic function also includes everything that is part of the lower frequency function of energy that sticks together to create this hard or resistive structure called the physical universe.It's all the same thing still.It's just that the lower frequential state creates the different feel.This is why it's important for us to incarnate here,because it is a very difficult place to exist within.The low frequencies mean that we start to lose our connectivity with our True Energetic Selves.We have to experience this place and learn from it to evolve very quickly here (8/2017) You said our multiverse has 397 universes all convoluted and intertwined in the same "holographic"space.In The Curators you said the multiverse is a small structure in a huge bath of interlaced Bucky Balls.Is this the static structure that our Source created? The way we describe things changes,as we become more able to understand higher concepts.When we go from one concept to another concept,we are able to stretch ourselves and understand more.When we get to another concept,we are able to understand that higher concept.But we wouldn't have been able to understand that higher concept had we not understood the first level of concept to change It's like we change that paradigm every time we go through it. Sometimes we need to have these things explained in different ways. Saying that all the universes are convoluted and intertwined with each other at all angles is the same as the multiverse looks like a small structure in a huge bath of interlaced Bucky Balls.Everything is interlaced as well. If you look at the structure of a Bucky Ball,which is basically a UK football,not everything is equal.The geometry that holds them together changes and it has to change to maintain its ability to have this pentagon shape.So everything is interdependent and interlaced with each other and that allows it to be interconnecting at all levels and all conditions.(8/2017). Or is it part of the Origin's substructure throughout its body? Although the multiverse is created by our Source,it is only an individualization or a quarantined area or a separated out area of the energy that is the Origin.If you think of the Origin creating the Source Entities by individualizing some of its own sentience and assigning that to various different energies,those energies are a function of its own structure. When the Origin sentience and energy was individualized,it became a function of Origin with a different purpose and a different signature.It became an individualized function of the various Source Entities.But the structure of the Source Entity is still part of the Origin,because the Source Entities are within the Origin. Everything that is individualized as Source Entity or as our True Energetic Selves or as our aspects or as our shards is still a function of Origin.We are still part of that all-pervading holographic space that is Origin basically,because everything is existing within everything else. It's very difficult to explain this,but I think "pervasive"is a really good way of saying that everything is everywhere,because everything is in the same space,but it's at different levels or different layers of the same space. That means that the same space can be used by a lot of different functions of structure,but it's the interaction of that structure at those different levels that means that different things can exist at different levels within the same space. Another way to think about it is the computer-aided engineering,when a design is created for a motor car with layers of things.They put the body on one layer,the chassis on another layer and electrical harness on another layer.They put the trim on another layer,the lighting on another layer and the engine on another layer.You can turn off these different layers,so you can isolate only the body or the wiring harness or the power train or the engine.If you put all the layers together,you get the whole car. It's a little bit like that.If you think of holography of things,it's that whole car in a computer-aided design environment.When you turn off different layers,the different frequencies or subdimensions or full dimensions,then you get just one aspect of it,which could be the physical universe or another universe at a different frequency level. You start to see that everything is in the same space,but it occupies different aspects of that space(8/2017). Some Pleiadian channels say we are "holographic beings"at the Higher Self level.What happens to one aspect happens to all the aspects of you as well.When you resolve an issue on Earth,the information is sent holographically to other versions of you in other star systems to help them heal and grow from your experience.Is this how you see it? Yes,sort of.We have to think of us as our True Energetic Selves and not the smaller aspect projected into the physical form.Everything that we experience is experienced by our True Energetic Self. Ultimately,as each of our aspects go back into our True Energetic Self, they also experience the collective information gained and the experience,learning and evolution that's gained by each of the different aspects within the multiversal environment.The different parallel conditions that occur through event space are also understood and learned at the same time. So everything is passed back to the True Energetic Self-nothing is lost and even all fractalized versions are passed back as well.So all parts of us experience these things.We may not experience it whilst we are incarnate,but when we go back to the energetic,we definitely experience it,because we will enter into some form of communion with our True Energetic Self. It's a correct statement and the "holographic being"bit is basically saying that we are our True Energetic Self that exists on many levels. We are sentience given a body of energy,which is commandeered by ourselves.That body of energy isn't a "body"full stop,it's just some form of structure that our sentience uses to work with the environment that we're in.We are holographic within our True Energetic Self. When the soul or aspect is in communion with the True Energetic Self, it is everywhere at the same time within that space.We and everything else records everything else.This is how things are passed on within the Source,so the Source can experience this as well.Since we are smaller parts of the Source,when the Source experiences all of these things,then all those True Energetic Selves that haven't experienced what we are experiencing would experience it as well. For instance,if no other aspect within your True Energetic Self or no other aspect within any other True Energetic Self is experiencing what you are experiencing now,then as you're experiencing it,that information gets passed onto your True Energetic Self and Source. Then it's available for the other True Energetic Selves as well. Everything experiences everything concurrently.It's because we're all part of the same thing. In essence,we're all smaller parts of Source,but we're all smaller parts of Origin as well.Even if we're a shard,we're a smaller part of our aspect,which is a smaller part of our True Energetic Self,which is a smaller part of Source.As Source,we're a smaller part of Origin,so therefore,we're all smaller parts of Origin.Everything is part of everything else. That's one way of explaining "holographic"where everything is part of everything else.Everything is in contact with everything else. Everything is perceived or understood or experienced by everything else concurrently(8/2017). I've heard that this is a "holographic universe"and created based on math.If so,do prime numbers have a pattern or it is completely random? The physical universe is part of the multiversal environment,which is based upon a structure,which is a function of Source.Source has a structure that's a function of the Origin.With the Origin being omnipresent,you could use the word "holographic"to describe it. Holographic means within and without everywhere.These things can be described in a number of different ways.Mathematics is one small and inaccurate way to describe things,but nevertheless used by a number of different civilizations within the gross physical universe. Mathematics is one of the purer ways to describe things,but it can only go a certain way and then it fails to go any further.Prime numbers are a function of mathematics that are sort of recurring and pure. The function of 12 and those numbers,which can be divisible within the 12,such as 1,6,2,3 and 4 and 12 itself are all parts of that 12.This number 12 is part of the function and structure of the Origin,Source, True Energetic Selves and ourselves as well.Sometimes we have to use some functions of math associated with our structure to create what we need to create.Sometimes the mathematics explains it and sometimes it doesn't.Sometimes these numbers are used as part of a standard function of understanding-sometimes the math associated with it is accurate and sometimes it's inaccurate(11/2018). How do other alien races with higher technologies use prime numbers? Other alien races with higher technologies would move beyond these things.They would go into a different state of understanding of the structure associated with the environment or the frequency that they're incarnated into to be able to create that which is there. Once you start to work with moving with frequencies and energies to create things rather than basic manufacturing processes of cutting something or generating something,you start to use different functions above maths or what we consider a solid basic foundation of a level of understanding(11/2018). The man who asked this question is a cook,but we're very interested in physics.He would be delighted to know the answer. It's great that you're a cook and that you're interested in physics and metaphysics.Metaphysics is that which is beyond physical physics.You don't have to be an engineer or a scientist to want to understand and to understand the greater reality (11/2018). Do any of the invisible energetic beings directly interact with people at their request?Or are they all observers,such as angels,caretakers, sprites,etc.? You can add to these entities things like nature spirits,elementals, guides and helpers.Sometimes they do.Sometimes they manifest a form,which is very close to the gross physical.Some of us have had an instance when we've talked to somebody or been given guidance by somebody and we've turned around and that individual is gone.If it's something really important that we need to do or an important decision or a change of direction we need to do,then a guide will manifest or create something that makes us move direction or gives us the answer that we need or solves the problem that we need solving. They do directly interact at times,but sometimes that interaction is momentary and out of the corner of our eye as well.Some people actually feel something close to them,like the brush of air going past them or like somebody has put their hand on their shoulder and that makes them feel like there is somebody there.All of a sudden,they turn around and there's nobody there. There's stories of people who've suddenly been pulled back from walking across the road and a car or a bus has gone screeching around the corner and they look around and nobody's there.Those are the sorts of interactions you might experience(9/2021).
