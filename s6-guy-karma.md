Source Entity's Words of Wisdom to Avoid Karma About the Author

For my dear wife Anne Elizabeth Milner Now "Ascended" (10th April 1957-24th December 2012)

## Introduction 

The information within this book,given to me by the Source Entity,is specifically designed to make us,dear readers,think,and thus,to make us change our ways,to recognize who and what we truly are,and to come out of our incarnate slumber and ascend. However,to do this we need to be vigilant. This is not a large book;it was not meant to be large.It has fewer than 120 pages and could be easily read in a day.However,I urge you not to do so.I ask you to read each excerpt in isolation and work with it to the very best of your ability.Absorb that which is presented to you and become free of the constraints of the physical,shrugging off karma and ascending in the process.Read a maximum of two excerpts a week and create a personal commitment to follow that which is presented.Or,better still,read one a week and be robust in your application of the advice.Observe your performance and make corrections where necessary, doing so with love in your heart and leading by example. Love transcends karma;it is all about the multiverse. Karma is only a function of the physical universe,and our true energetic selves,when attracted to the lower frequencies associated with the physical universe,are linked to it. Hence the need to return to it to break the link,to break the karmic cycle.Once the link with the physical is broken,the need to incarnate is no longer necessary,and the true energetic self can ascend the frequencies and evolve in the process without needing to experience ever again those lower frequencies associated with the physical universe. Self-Love and the love of others is,therefore,a key to ascension,and when one has finished this book,one will be"In Love,""In Ascension"-avoiding karma in the process.

#### Reacting to Taunts 

The first stage in avoiding karma is not to react to the taunts and jibes of those we interface with but instead for us to see them as beings on an evolutionary path as we are. Looking beneath the words and actions of the accuser for the greater meaning,we must be the tolerant and benevolent observer,understanding the experience of the lessons we are offered by them and reacting with compassion and thanks.Thus,we evolve in the process.

#### Beware of the Digital Reality 

Karma is a function of attraction to the physical and also works in/with our interfacing with the digital reality because it is a function of the physical.As such,it is also a potential addiction,serving to anchor us to the physical.

#### Owning Only What We Need 

We are reminded to look at what we need in life versus what we want in life.If our need is less than our want,then we have a potential for accruing the lower frequencies or karma associated with the attraction to ownership of physical belongings.This is a function of karma,which is never satisfied,for the more we have,the more we seem to want.

Loving Our Enemies;for We Are One To love our enemies is to love ourselves,for our enemies are our "selves."Recognition of the fact that we are all "one"and one with God removes the need to identify others as our enemies.How can people truly be our enemies when they are just another part of us?! Recognition of this reality and taking action,based upon it,is a most powerful way of avoiding karma.

Being of Service We are here to be of service to those who need help and do so in a selfless way that does not demand reward.Being of service in general creates positive karma(attraction to the higher frequencies),but we must be careful not to get into the mindset that suggests that we will be rewarded at some time,for this creates negative karma(attraction to the lower frequencies).

Defining Our Motivation Standing back and considering the motivation behind our actions is necessary.Are we motivated based upon need or greed?Service or selfishness?Any actions that are based upon physical motivations are attractions to negative karma.

Avoiding Gossip When we avoid being pulled into gossip or starting gossip,we are using good judgment. Gossip is the most effective way to accrue the negative karma experienced by mankind. Gossip is a particularly insidious pastime as it drags us into the lower frequency energies of another,effectively boosting that person's energy.As more people join in the "gossip," the leader of the gossip becomes the center of a collective that is created by energies that are usually focused upon the derision of another.This is the creation of a collective and its synergetic effects for the wrong reason.This effectively links us as members of the collective to an energy sink that creates an "overlay"mentality that circumvents our personal [mentality/thinking]and destroys our free will. The antidote is for us to not get involved in gossip by finely tuning our "observer selves"- an observational tool that allows us to look from the perspective of an outsider of such discussions.If we see ourselves as already engaged in gossip,it is time for us to say we have no further comment and then walk away.

Shunning Judgment Judgment,both individual and collective,is a function of gossip and,therefore,provides a clear and direct path to low frequency existence,creating a downward spiral,frequency- wise. Judgment is,therefore,something that we should never enter into,for it is a function of personalized perception of the processes that led to a certain position,but not the actual ones that lead to "fact"and not"judgment."

Choosing Our Friends with Care Being of good cheer and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals whilst incarnate is wise.We should avoid those who drag us down by enticing us to be part of lower frequency actions.

Colluding to Gain False Friends A more insidious form of karma can be observed in the need to collude.Collusion is that which we do when we seek favor from others to be part of "the"team,"the"group,or to be with someone of influence whose association,we think,will benefit us in some social, business or egotistical way,thus,giving us the "upper hand." The need to collude is,therefore,based upon physical desires and,as such,attracts those lower frequencies associated with the more subtle aspects of physical existence.

Seeking Favors,a Form of Collusion Seeking favor with another is a form of collusion and results in an expectation of personal benefit from the favor.When we seek favor,we are ALWAYS looking for some sort of reward as a result of the favor,which when not given,results in our being disappointed,then thinking negatively,and having feelings of betrayal.When we require and receive a favor, we are in "favor debt"to the person giving us the favor.This results in negative anticipation of what the requested favor might be and whether we can support such a request to the expectations of the requester.As a result,the returned favor is always greater than that initially given. We should,therefore,not seek favors but should give freely as a gift that which is requested.Thus,we should expect nothing in return,except God's love because the reward of recognition of such a potential karmic loop is now broken.

Being Aware of Automatic Addictions It is important for us to stand back and look at what we do on a daily and automatic basis. How much of what we do is necessary for us to survive?How much is an addiction to physical "pleasure"that is based upon an automated action/response?If we give up our addictions,we will lose automatically generated karma.

Noticing Minor Addictions Being aware of minor addictions is necessary,especially the ones that we may consider to be not an addiction but more of a preference.Addictions of any type are a constant link to the low frequencies.Minor addictions are insidious and invisible to all but the most vigilant of truth seekers.

Being Addicted to Sex Our engaging in sex for procreation is both a necessity and a delight.However,engaging in sex for recreation can lead us down the path of addiction to the physical sensation associated with sex,which is a low frequency function.

Discerning Fears When we look at our fears,it is important to notice where they are anchored.Are they about work,relationships,possessions,appearance,personal credibility or money?Any of these are fears that are based in the physical environment and are nothing we would pay any attention to in the energetic.If we don't pay attention to these or any other types of fear in the energetic,then why should we pay attention to them whilst incarnate,for fear is a product of being in the lower frequencies associated with incarnate existence.

Choosing Love Love is the antidote to karma,so we must Love God; Love our neighbors; Love our enemies. Love our partners/our wives; Love ourselves;Love our mistakes; Love our successes; Love our current experiences; Love our planet; Love our teachers;and Love that which presents its "self"to offer us experience,learning and evolution. If we love all of these things in an unreserved way,we will surely avoid karma for life!

Being Calm Being of a calm demeanor and entering into everything we do in a calm and collected way, irrespective of the environment in which we find ourselves is so important.When we are confronted with adverse conditions,it is easy for us to become part of those conditions and be drawn into the lower frequencies that created them. By staying calm,we are able to rise above the drama,remain unaffected,and achieve an efficient response whilst staying within the high frequencies.In this way we can and do work with the physical whilst being "in"the physical without being "of"the physical.Thus, calmness is a state of mind that deflects the opportunity for gaining karmic content through spontaneous response. Remaining in calmness in all situations makes our "observer self"come into play.This ensures that the bigger picture is taken into account and allows us to respond in a respectful, thoughtful and knowledgeable way.Thus,we must strive to maintain calmness at all times.

Thinking Before Responding It is good practice the moment we wake up in the morning to think about what we can do to avoid attraction to the low frequency energies we call karma. Consciously avoiding karma takes significant practice until it is achieved on an automatic basis.If we think about everything we are doing or are about to do with a view toward the possibility of accruing karma and then think about how we can avoid it,we will make inroads into awareness of how to make this practice a regular part of our lives. Once we have established "karma-safe"responses,then we can do,say and react in those ways in preference to our former instantaneous and "off the cuff"responses and reactions. Once we get used to reacting and working in a karma-safe way,we will notice over a period of time that we are getting"lighter".This is the proof that we are attracting higher frequency energies,accruing positive karma and accelerating our evolutionary process.

Communing with God to Create Heaven When we are in the energetic,we are totally free and have instant communication with our peers and our Creator.We have no constraints and are not encumbered by a physical body, for then we are in our normal high frequency,high dimensional environment. When we are incarnate,we are trapped in extremely limited and slow bodies that decay,cut off our communication with our energetic peers and our Creator,and,are subject to pain, discomfort,illness and disease.In comparison to our normal energetic environment,it is hell.We can,however,alleviate the level of hellish experience by endeavoring to commune with the rest of us that is still in the energetic with our Creator,our Source Entity,our God. By communing with God and our true selves whilst incarnate,as well as living in a way that does not attract the lower frequencies associated with the physical (karma),we can experience in some limited way that which we experience whilst in the energetic- what we may refer to as "heaven."We can,therefore,through correct living and dedicated meditation,make "heaven"on Earth.To not do so and to go against this way of life,we can and do make our own hell on Earth!

Being Happy and Kind It is easy to always smile when we remember our knowledge of the greater reality.Saying "Good morning"to others,always replying in a positive manner,opening the door for the person behind us,and letting the other person have the parking spot or pull out into the queue before us is a natural part of that remembrance.Why wouldn't we provide help to those who need it,assist those in need of an escort across the road,and make a habit of being kind and doing "good"things? These small things increase our frequencies,as well as the frequencies of those around us. In doing these small things,we decrease our opportunities of accruing the lower frequencies associated with karma,not only for us but everyone else.This in itself is a great kindness and an even greater service as it increases joy in the world.

Addressing Our Responsibilities Just because we are seekers of the truth,know the greater reality,and commune with God on a daily basis,it doesn't mean that we are able ignore our roles and responsibilities whilst in the physical.We planned these responsibilities as part of our experiences,our learning, and our evolution.To ignore them means our incarnation is meaningless and will result in karma with the need for us to incarnate again to fulfill the experiences set out in our previous plan. We are here to know the greater reality,to know God and to deliver our earthly duties with skill and perfection,thus avoiding karma in the process.

Allowing Others to Have Their Beliefs We must never assume that as spiritual individuals devoted to knowing the greater reality; we can convert someone else who is not yet ready to know the truth. Forcing someone to accept another paradigm is doomed to failure and could strain or even end friendships,thus creating low frequency energy associations.Instead,it's important to love all for who they are and meditate on their liberation. When a person is ready to receive the truth,we will know.

Choosing Our Habits Wisely Habits can be good or bad,but the nature of a habit is such that it is an automatic "invisible function"that we do every day.As such,it is ignored by our "physical consciousness." Attention to what a habit is and what it is not,therefore,is a necessary prelude to success in the quest for attaining self-awareness and ultimate evolution.Such understanding helps us separate good habits from bad habits. Good habits are those that lead to higher frequency existence and are ultimately supported by good like-minded people surrounding us.Good habits let us exist"within"the physical without being "of"the physical. Bad habits keep our energies fixed within the low frequencies of the physical;therefore,they arrest our opportunities for evolution and perpetuate our need for incarnation.

Fulfilling Commitments Completing our commitments with joy in our hearts is important.If we have committed to do something by a certain time and/or degree to or for anyone or anything or even ourselves, we must follow through and deliver what we have committed to do. To not deliver our commitments is to relinquish responsibility for our thoughts,our intentions,our actions and our evolution.To not deliver our commitments makes that invisible commitment stay in the lower frequencies,thus,arresting our evolution.

Exercising Care To gain high frequencies,it is imperative for us to be caring in all circumstances.For example,we must do the following: Care about what we do; Care about what we say; Care about what we eat; Care about what we drink; Care about what we breathe; Care about how we exercise; Care about how we help; Care about how we feel; Care about our relationships;Care about how others feel; Care about our physical education; Care about our spiritual education; Care about those we love; Care about those we don't lovelove them,too! Care about our home; Care about our friends; Care about our country; Care about our planet; Care about our universe; Care about our relationship with God;and Care about EVERYONE and EVERYTHING because God cares about US!

Being Mindful Being mindful about what we say and do is imperative.We must do everything we can to ensure that whatever we say or do is constructive and not destructive,creative and not unimaginative,positive and not negative.Being mindful will help us make a difference.

Seeing the Light in All If we see the light in everyone,then everybody will see the light in us.By illustrating that we see the light in everyone and everything,we also illustrate that we see the good in everyone and everything. Illustrating that we see the light in everyone is a most positive step,for it is an addictive quality that breaks down barriers.

Following Source Entity's Ten Commandments 1.Covet not another's property.Why would we want to covet the property of another, especially if the means by which we live could not support it?Living the best we can by the means we have at hand and being content,as well as remembering we are doing the best we can with what we have and the situation we find yourself in will bring us peace.Also,it helps to remember that whatever we own is only transient because this ownership is no longer ours when our physical body passes away. 2.Covet not another's spouse.The reason we are with our current spouse could be because we have worked together before or because we have some issues to work out together now for mutual evolution.This is an interesting commandment,for it is often the root cause of so much karmic energy.Of course,it means anybody else's spouse other than our own. 3.Do unto others as they do unto you.Why do we pain ourselves so much by trying to get back at others for what they do to us?It is not a creative use of our energies.We must try to put ourselves in their position,understand their issues and give them our help and love whenever we can-even if we just don't like them.Assisting them will be a big help for them,especially if they receive it from someone whom they consider to be their enemy or adversary.Maybe if we see the good in them,they will,too.If we don't,we create frustration and karma when we should be in acceptance and move on with love in our heart. 4.Help others less able than ourselves.This is a fundamental rule,for it is the one that has the most opportunities attached to it to help us evolve.The point here is that we should give help to those who need it when the opportunity presents itself.We must remember we are all from the same spirit,the same Source.Why be selfish with our good health?Sharing it with others now opens the door for others to share theirs with us when our time comes to be less able-thus,coming full circle. 5.Help others less fortunate than yourself.As with #4 this is fundamental.Whereas #4 is aligned to the physical aspects of the human condition,this rule is closer to the situation that others find themselves in.Again,we are reminded to help others when the opportunity presents itself.The help can be as benign as shopping for them,servicing their car or buying them a meal when they need it. 6.The universe is yours forever.Why do we get hung up on ownership of physical things when the whole universe is ours for the taking when we take the time to realize it and work with it?As humanity we are hung up on ownership of the Earth,but no one owns the Earth. It is an entity in its own right.Once we realize that,we are able to go anywhere at any time and enjoy the universe and the earth in its entirety,so why would we want to pin ourselves down to a small section of it?Ownership of land and other physical things is okay as a comfort blanket,but in real terms when we are fully awakened to the reality that is around us,we really don't need to own or link ourselves to anything. 7.Worship not graven idols.This is relatively easy to follow in this day and age,for there is a greater level of understanding than there was a couple of thousand years ago.In essence this also works for churches as well,for they are a larger version of the graven idol.Why worship the physical when we can meditate upon gaining access to the energetic/spiritual?The initial use of an idol was to give the initiate (a student of the truth,real truth!)something to focus upon when engaging in deep meditation.It has since been taken completely out of context and is no longer a requirement in today's society. 8.Honor your parents.This is mainly due to the need to help our parents when their physical bodies decay to the point where they are no longer able to contribute to the community in the way they used to.This is especially relevant in the last few thousand years when the knowledge and command of the energies of the universe have been lost to most of those who are incarnate.The older generation has all the knowledge of the past to give us and our children.Without them we would not appreciate our roots and would lose the fundamentals.Without the fundamentals the house of knowledge is but a pack of cards arranged in the shape of a house.There have been many incarnate races that have been laid bare,exposed to the elements,and nowhere to go as a result of catastrophe because they no longer had sight of the basic fundamentals. 9.Do not tell lies about your neighbor.This is again another general issue that is a major opportunity to gain karmic energy and slow down our evolution by being dragged down the frequencies.Why would we want to tell lies anyway?If we have done something wrong,we must own up to it and accept that we are in an opportunity to experience something else in the physical that will be of benefit later.This also covers the terrible habit of gossiping about someone to try to gain favor with others around us.Eventually this backfires and costs us more karmic energy than we originally accrued.Worse still,it also "costs"those we gossiped about (unless they are more highly evolved)as they generally will want to "get one back"on us,which invokes karmic energy. 10.Steal not from your neighbor.Why steal at all?This is not necessary as what we have with us is all that we need to experience life in the physical according to the plan we laid out.The Lord/we shall provide,and we do.Everything is provided to ensure that our "sortie" on Earth in the lower frequencies is maintained at its most optimal evolutionary condition. This is another way to gain massive karmic energy because invariably we end up lying to cover ourselves if we steal.

Practicing Patience Being patient with everyone,everything,and especially ourselves is an excellent practice. Adopting a calm and patient demeanor attracts higher frequency energies and high frequency friends. When we are patient and calm,we provide an excellent example to others of how to live in the frantic world of the gross physical whilst avoiding lower frequency addictions associated with being restless.

Having No Expectation of Reward Expectation can be considered the opposite function of desire,specifically when we expect a reward for being of service.Doing so also ties us into the low frequency desires of the physical and,therefore,delivers a level of karma. Expectation is something to be avoided from a more personal perspective,especially when we "expect"a certain response or action from a friend or colleague. Expecting nothing,we will gain two things: 1.Freedom from the karmic link that expectation gives us;and 2.Joy when a friend or colleague responds in the correct or most spiritually desirable way.

Anticipating Nothing Anticipation is based upon expectation,therefore,it links us to a "desired"result.When we remove expectation,we will also remove anticipation,for the one creates the other. When we remove both conditions from our minds,we negate the opportunity for us to enter into the"closed loop"of continuous cause and effect that creates the one or the other.Thus, it is wise for us to leave anticipation and expectation to their own devices.

Accepting Divine Providence in All Situations When we anticipate an outcome,we paint a picture of what we desire,thus identifying that outcome as positive or a negative,based upon the outcome we anticipated. Anticipation of an outcome is a human condition that ultimately links us to the physical When we are able to be in the "now,"thereby removing the element of anticipation,we are working in acceptance that divine providence will prevail and bring the outcome that is the best for a particular situation.

Recognizing Situations as Opportunities for Evolution Anticipation is a limiting thought process that is based upon our expectation of a desired outcome with desire being defined as "a condition of specific focus on the material." Anticipation results from our expectation of a preferred outcome.In this case,our focus is on the outcome rather than the wider spiritual process that results in the outcome.Should the anticipated outcome not be that which we expected,then we become dissatisfied and/ or are disappointed.When we feel this way,it is as a result of our working with the smaller "incarnate picture"rather than observing the result or outcome from the larger spiritual perspective.We must remember that no matter what the outcome,what is experienced is designed to help us evolve. We should,therefore,accept situations presented in life as evolutionary opportunities rather than planning for certain "anticipated"outcomes and wasting time thinking about where and when the outcomes may happen and what they will be.

Accepting Frustration Frustration is a product of desire turning into anticipation and expectation.It is based upon our inability to wait for that which will come with divine providence at the correct juncture in our incarnate existence. Frustration is also borne from our inability to succeed in our plans.When we do this,it is the result of our not adapting to the learning opportunities that are presented to us to evolve;instead,we choose to overlay these experiences with preferred outcomes instead of the actual outcomes. Frustration can be avoided by expecting nothing whilst accepting everything and living in the product of the divine plan.

Being Impatient,a Predecessor to Frustration Impatience is a precursor to frustration and its associated emotional responses.It is a product of our being in the physical whilst retaining an energetic memory of working within the energetic.Whilst in the energetic,we are able to affect changes instantaneously through pure intention that creates thought and later action based upon that thought. In the low frequencies of the physical universe,this is not possible,but our memory of such function remains within us while incarnate-hence,our frustration when "things"do not happen.In this instance the antidote is to remain calm and wait patiently for the fruits of our work to come into fruition. Impatience begins with its link to low frequency thoughts and desire for "instant gratification,"a product of "modern times,"where we simply "cannot wait"for this or that to occur.This pulls down our frequencies and negates the higher frequency thoughts of calmness and the joy of waiting for that which has been manifest to come into fruition. We deprive ourselves of wondering in awe at the processes that work behind the scenes to finalize that which has been manifested through intention,thought and action.

Feeling Dissatisfied and Impatient We mustn't be impatient;we must watch out for impatience.It is a function of anticipative desire and is steeped in the expectation of that which may or may not happen. Impatience is created when we are dissatisfied with that which we have,are,or expect to be, or from a temporal perspective,expect to be or have earlier. As time does not exist in the energetic,impatience is,therefore,futile.We must trust that everything happens when it is supposed to happen to give us the correct level of experiential/learning content that will allow our flawless evolution to occur.

Experiencing Contentment as a Double-Edged Sword When we are content,we are ripe for working with the physical whilst being "in"the physical but not "of"the physical.We are not drawn to those lower frequency attractions of materialism that create a karmic link to the physical and arrest our personal ascension through the frequencies.We can soar above these lower frequencies and go ever onwards and upwards towards constant communion with our Creator. However,if we are content with our spiritual progress and happy where we are,doing what we're doing and experiencing communion with spirit,we will never progress beyond that which is really just localized spirit.We will not reach the dizzying heights required to ensure constant communion with our Creator.

Offering Unconditional Love Offering love-that is,unconditional love-is the most wonderful thing that we can give to one another.This should not be reserved for those that we know,love,trust,revere and respect,however.It should also be given to those that we "initially"don't know,fear,hate, loathe,dislike or distrust,for we are all part of the Source Entity.They are,therefore,part of us.Recognizing and experientially knowing this is a major step for us on the road to high frequency existence.

Sharing Kindness When we are kind or offer kindness to anyone,whatever the circumstances,we take a step on our road to high frequency existence,for being kind is a prelude to unconditional love of one and all.

Perpetuating Karma The universe does not run on karma.We as mankind create it through infatuation with the low frequencies associated with the physical.Why do we perpetuate that which does not naturally exist?

Evading a Competitive Mindset We must avoid being in competition with others on all levels,including spiritual levels. Competition occurs when we are enticed into trying to become like someone else-someone who seems to have spiritual skills or abilities that we feel we lack and desire to have.We see this person as being better than we are and strive to become better than this individual is. In circumstances like this,we forget that we are individual beings on our own paths.As such,we should and must concentrate on what we are doing in our own way and not try to be equal to or better than those around us.We need to just be ourselves and evolve by our own work in our own perfection and in our own time.

Being Complacent About Complacency Complacency is the right hand man of karma.It waits for us when we feel that we have addressed all the spiritual issues that we need to work on and now need to do no more. When we are convinced that the work is done,we are actually just about to start,for the task of working towards God and perfection is a lifetime's work,requiring constant diligence, introspection and re-calibration of spiritual achievement.

Accepting Everything Resistance to that which happens in life that we consider to be sub-optimal is resistance to learning from those opportunities presented to us as lessons in how to disassociate ourselves from certain events-those events borne in physicality. Our acceptance neutralizes resistance and negates our need to re-experience that which is experienced but resisted.When we neutralize resistance,acceptance can and does remove the opportunity for the karmic influence that resistance introduces.

Learning by Observation When we observe those around us who are not aware of the greater reality,we often note how they work for the good of themselves and not for the good of everyone else and their Creator. Although we will not be able to change them,they "gift"us a constant reminder of what we could become if we let ourselves slip back into the belief that physical existence is the only reality. With this in mind,we will continue to work hard at being of service,meditating on our Creator,and experiencing the greater reality.

Comparing Ourselves with Others We must avoid comparing ourselves with others.Once we embark upon the road of comparison with our friends,relatives,neighbors and peers,we run the risk of becoming dissatisfied with ourselves and our "transient"Earthly possessions. Dissatisfaction is an insidious link to physical existence and one that demands us to be vigilant.

Living as Transient Custodians It's imperative for us to remember that we are only custodians of that which we have around us whilst in the physical.We never actually own anything.Instead,we are only given the opportunity to work with,live with,and maintain that which we buy for the period of time we are incarnate.

Disconnecting the Physical from the Energetic Self Physical pain is a constant reminder that we are in a physical vehicle that is limited by the thought processes of being incarnate.“Limited”and“thought'"are the operative words here for when we are not“limited"by the "thought constraints"of being in physical form and are able to work with the greater reality of being "in"the physical but not "of"the physical,then we realize that the physical form is a transient condition.As such,it is used for transitory moments of experience whilst we are in the lower frequencies that are associated with the physical universe. When we realize-truly realize to the core of our being-this truth,we are able to disconnect our physical selves from our energetic selves and thus remove our mental link to the lower frequencies.In this way,by disconnecting our energetic selves from the function of pain in the physical vehicle we inhabit,we can live a pain-free physical existence and negate the karmic link in the process. Such mastery of the physical requires dedicated,continuous,unwavering,focused,robust and intention-based thought 24 hours a day 7 days a week

Being Vigilant of Addictive Sensations Physical pain is a constant reminder that we are in a physical vehicle.Likewise,sexual sensations and other bodily addictions are also a reminder that we are limited by the thought/experience processes of the vehicle we are incarnated within. Clearly some of the sensations we feel whilst incarnate are a joy to experience.Some, like sexual sensations,can be addictive.Others,such as touch,taste,smell and sight are sensations that are limited to our being incarnate.In the energetic we are above these sensations and,therefore,not affected by their potential additive qualities.In our need to be incarnate to aid our evolutionary commitment,we subsequently experience multiple sensations on a daily basis,some of which are a link to the low frequencies of the physical. We must be vigilant of sensations,for they can be insidious in their addictive qualities.
