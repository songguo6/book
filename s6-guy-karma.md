For my dear wife Anne Elizabeth Milner Now "Ascended" 

(10th April 1957 - 24th December 2012)

### Introduction 

**介绍**

The information within this book,given to me by the Source Entity,is specifically designed to make us,dear readers,think,and thus,to make us change our ways,to recognize who and what we truly are,and to come out of our incarnate slumber and ascend.  

这本书里的信息是源实体给我的，专门用来让我们亲爱的读者思考，从而让我们改变自己的方式，认识到我们真正是谁，我们是什么，并从化身的沉睡中走出来，获得扬升。

However,to do this we need to be vigilant.  

然而，要做到这一点，我们需要保持警惕。

This is not a large book;it was not meant to be large. It has fewer than 120 pages and could be easily read in a day. However,I urge you not to do so. I ask you to read each excerpt in isolation and work with it to the very best of your ability. Absorb that which is presented to you and become free of the constraints of the physical,shrugging off karma and ascending in the process. Read a maximum of two excerpts a week and create a personal commitment to follow that which is presented. Or,better still,read one a week and be robust in your application of the advice. Observe your performance and make corrections where necessary, doing so with love in your heart and leading by example.  

这不是一本大书，也不应该是一本大书，它只有不到120页，一天就能读完。然而，我劝你不要这么做，我要求你单独阅读每一个节选，并尽你所能吸收呈现在你面前的内容，摆脱肉体的束缚，摆脱业力，在这个过程中扬升。每周最多阅读两篇节选，并做出个人承诺，遵从节选内容。或者，更好的办法是每周阅读一篇，并积极应用建议。观察自己的表现，并在必要时做出修正，做到心中有爱，以身作则。

Love transcends karma;it is all about the multiverse.  

爱超越业力；爱是关于多维宇宙的。

Karma is only a function of the physical universe,and our true energetic selves,when attracted to the lower frequencies associated with the physical universe,are linked to it.  Hence the need to return to it to break the link,to break the karmic cycle. Once the link with the physical is broken,the need to incarnate is no longer necessary,and the true energetic self can ascend the frequencies and evolve in the process without needing to experience ever again those lower frequencies associated with the physical universe.  

业力只是物质宇宙的一种功能，我们真正的能量自我被与物质宇宙相关的低频所吸引时就会与物质宇宙联系在一起。一旦与物质宇宙的联系被打破，就不再需要化身，真正的能量自我就能提升频率，并在这个过程中不断进化，而无需再次体验与物质宇宙相关的低频。

Self-Love and the love of others is,therefore,a key to ascension,and when one has finished this book,one will be"In Love,""In Ascension"-avoiding karma in the process.  

因此，自爱和对他人的爱是扬升的关键。当一个人读完这本书，他将在爱中，在扬升中，在这个过程中避免业力。

### Reacting to Taunts 

**面对奚落的反应**

The first stage in avoiding karma is not to react to the taunts and jibes of those we interface with but instead for us to see them as beings on an evolutionary path as we are.  Looking beneath the words and actions of the accuser for the greater meaning,we must be the tolerant and benevolent observer,understanding the experience of the lessons we are offered by them and reacting with compassion and thanks. Thus,we evolve in the process. 

避免业力的第一阶段，是不对那些与我们打交道的人的奚落和嘲笑做出反应，而是把他们看作和我们一样走在进化道路上的人。从指责者的言行中寻找更深层次的意义，我们必须做一个宽容、仁慈的旁观者，理解他们为我们提供的经验和教训，并以慈悲和感恩的心作出反应。

### Beware of the Digital Reality

**当心虚拟现实**

Karma is a function of attraction to the physical and also works in/with our interfacing with the digital reality because it is a function of the physical. As such,it is also a potential addiction,serving to anchor us to the physical. 

业力是对物质的一种吸引，同时也与我们与数字化现实的互动有关，因为它是物质的一种功能。

### Owning Only What We Need 

**只拥有我们需要的东西**

We are reminded to look at what we need in life versus what we want in life. If our need is less than our want,then we have a potential for accruing the lower frequencies or karma associated with the attraction to ownership of physical belongings. This is a function of karma,which is never satisfied,for the more we have,the more we seem to want. 

如果我们的需求小于我们的愿望，那么我们就有可能累积与吸引我们拥有物质财富相关的低频或业力。这是业力的作用，它永远不会满足，因为我们拥有的越多，我们似乎想要的就越多。

### Loving Our Enemies;for We Are One 

**爱我们的敌人，因为我们本为一体**

To love our enemies is to love ourselves,for our enemies are our "selves. "Recognition of the fact that we are all "one"and one with God removes the need to identify others as our enemies. How can people truly be our enemies when they are just another part of us? ! Recognition of this reality and taking action,based upon it,is a most powerful way of avoiding karma. 

爱我们的敌人就是爱我们自己，因为我们的敌人就是我们的“自己”。认识到我们都是“一体”的，都是与上帝合一的，就没有必要把别人当作我们的敌人！认识到这一现实并据此采取行动，是避免业力的最有效方法。

### Being of Service 

**乐于服务** 

We are here to be of service to those who need help and do so in a selfless way that does not demand reward. Being of service in general creates positive karma(attraction to the higher frequencies),but we must be careful not to get into the mindset that suggests that we will be rewarded at some time,for this creates negative karma(attraction to the lower frequencies). 

我们在这里是为那些需要帮助的人提供服务的，而且是以一种无私的、不要求回报的方式提供服务。一般来说，提供服务会产生积极的业力（对较高频率的吸引），但我们必须小心，不要陷入那种认为我们总有一天会得到回报的心态，因为这会产生消极的业力（对较低频率的吸引）。

### Defining Our Motivation 

**定义我们的动机**

Standing back and considering the motivation behind our actions is necessary. Are we motivated based upon need or greed? Service or selfishness? Any actions that are based upon physical motivations are attractions to negative karma. 

我们的动机是需要还是贪婪，是服务还是自私？任何基于物质动机的行为都会招致负面的业力。

### Avoiding Gossip 

**避免制造流言蜚语** 

When we avoid being pulled into gossip or starting gossip,we are using good judgment.  Gossip is the most effective way to accrue the negative karma experienced by mankind.  

当我们避免被卷入流言蜚语或引发流言蜚语时，我们就是在运用良好的判断力。流言蜚语是累积人类负面业力的最有效方式。

Gossip is a particularly insidious pastime as it drags us into the lower frequency energies of another,effectively boosting that person's energy. As more people join in the "gossip," the leader of the gossip becomes the center of a collective that is created by energies that are usually focused upon the derision of another. This is the creation of a collective and its synergetic effects for the wrong reason. This effectively links us as members of the collective to an energy sink that creates an "overlay"mentality that circumvents our personal "mentality/thinking" and destroys our free will.  

流言蜚语是一种特别阴险的消遣方式，因为它把我们拖入他人的低频能量中，有效地提升了他人的能量。随着越来越多的人加入到“流言蜚语”中，流言蜚语的领导者就会成为一个集体的中心，而这个集体是由通常专注于嘲笑他人的能量所创造的。这实际上是将我们作为集体成员与一个能量池联系在一起，形成了一种“叠加”心态，绕过了我们个人的“心态/思维”，破坏了我们的自由意志。

The antidote is for us to not get involved in gossip by finely tuning our "observer selves"- an observational tool that allows us to look from the perspective of an outsider of such discussions. If we see ourselves as already engaged in gossip,it is time for us to say we have no further comment and then walk away. 

我们的解药是通过调整我们的“观察者自我”来避免卷入流言蜚语。这是一种观察工具，能让我们以局外人的视角来看待此类讨论。如果我们发现自己已经卷入了流言蜚语，那么我们就应该说“无可奉告”，然后走开。

### Shunning Judgment 

**避免评判**

Judgment,both individual and collective,is a function of gossip and,therefore,provides a clear and direct path to low frequency existence,creating a downward spiral,frequency-wise.  

无论是个人还是集体的评判，都是流言蜚语的一种功能，因此，它提供了一条通往低频率存在的清晰而直接的道路，造成了频率上的螺旋式下降。

Judgment is,therefore,something that we should never enter into,for it is a function of personalized perception of the processes that led to a certain position,but not the actual ones that lead to "fact"and not"judgment. "

因此，评判是我们永远不应该进入的东西，因为它是对导致某种立场的过程的个人化感知，而不是导致“事实”而非“判断”的实际过程。

### Choosing Our Friends with Care 

**善择吾友**

Being of good cheer and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals whilst incarnate is wise. We should avoid those who drag us down by enticing us to be part of lower frequency actions. 

在化身为人时，保持良好的心态并与志同道合的人为伍是明智之举。我们应该避免那些引诱我们参与低频行动，从而拖累我们的人。

### Colluding to Gain False Friends

**通过勾结而获得的虚假朋友**

A more insidious form of karma can be observed in the need to collude. Collusion is that which we do when we seek favor from others to be part of "the"team,"the"group,or to be with someone of influence whose association,we think,will benefit us in some social, business or egotistical way,thus,giving us the "upper hand. " 

一种更隐蔽的业力形式可以从勾结的需要中观察到。勾结是指我们寻求他人的帮助，以成为团队、团体的一员，或与某个有影响力的人在一起，我们认为与他的交往会使我们在社交、商业或自我方面受益，从而使我们“占上风”。

The need to collude is,therefore,based upon physical desires and,as such,attracts those lower frequencies associated with the more subtle aspects of physical existence. 

勾结的需要是基于肉体的欲望，因此会吸引那些与肉体存在的更微妙方面相关的较低频率。

### Seeking Favors,a Form of Collusion 

**拉关系，一种勾结的形式**

Seeking favor with another is a form of collusion and results in an expectation of personal benefit from the favor. When we seek favor,we are ALWAYS looking for some sort of reward as a result of the favor,which when not given,results in our being disappointed,then thinking negatively,and having feelings of betrayal. When we require and receive a favor, we are in "favor debt"to the person giving us the favor. This results in negative anticipation of what the requested favor might be and whether we can support such a request to the expectations of the requester. As a result,the returned favor is always greater than that initially given.  

We should,therefore,not seek favors but should give freely as a gift that which is requested. Thus,we should expect nothing in return,except God's love because the reward of recognition of such a potential karmic loop is now broken. 

### Being Aware of Automatic Addictions 

**觉察“自动成瘾”**

It is important for us to stand back and look at what we do on a daily and automatic basis.  

How much of what we do is necessary for us to survive? How much is an addiction to physical "pleasure"that is based upon an automated action/response? If we give up our addictions,we will lose automatically generated karma. 

对我们来说，重要的是退后一步，看看我们每天自动做的事情。

在我们所做的事情中，有多少是我们生存所必需的？有多少是对基于自动行动/反应的身体“快感”的上瘾？如果我们放弃我们的瘾，我们就会失去自动产生的业力。

### Noticing Minor Addictions 

**注意轻微的上瘾** 

Being aware of minor addictions is necessary,especially the ones that we may consider to be not an addiction but more of a preference. Addictions of any type are a constant link to the low frequencies. Minor addictions are insidious and invisible to all but the most vigilant of truth seekers. 

意识到轻微的成瘾是必要的，尤其是那些我们可能认为不是成瘾，而更像是一种偏好的成瘾。任何类型的成瘾都是与低频的持续联系。轻微的成瘾是隐蔽的，除了最警觉的真相探索者之外，其他人都看不到。

### Being Addicted to Sex 

**沉迷于性**

Our engaging in sex for procreation is both a necessity and a delight. However,engaging in sex for recreation can lead us down the path of addiction to the physical sensation associated with sex,which is a low frequency function. 

我们为生育而进行性生活既是一种需要，也是一种享受。然而，为了消遣而进行性生活会让我们沉迷于与性生活相关的身体感觉，这是一种低频功能。

### Discerning Fears 

**辨识恐惧** 

When we look at our fears,it is important to notice where they are anchored. Are they about work,relationships,possessions,appearance,personal credibility or money? Any of these are fears that are based in the physical environment and are nothing we would pay any attention to in the energetic. If we don't pay attention to these or any other types of fear in the energetic,then why should we pay attention to them whilst incarnate,for fear is a product of being in the lower frequencies associated with incarnate existence. 

当我们审视自己的恐惧时，重要的是要注意到它们的根源所在：它们是关于工作、人际关系、财产、外表、个人信誉还是金钱？如果我们在能量中不关注这些或任何其他类型的恐惧，那么当我们化身为人时，为什么还要关注它们，因为恐惧是与化身存在相关的低频的产物。

### Choosing Love 

**选择爱** 

Love is the antidote to karma,so we must 

- Love God; 
- Love our neighbors; 
- Love our enemies;
- Love our partners/our wives; 
- Love ourselves;
- Love our mistakes; 
- Love our successes; 
- Love our current experiences; 
- Love our planet; 
- Love our teachers;
- Love that which presents its "self"to offer us experience,learning and evolution.  

If we love all of these things in an unreserved way,we will surely avoid karma for life!

爱是业力的解药，因此我们必须 

- 爱上帝； 
- 爱我们的邻居； 
- 爱我们的敌人；
- 爱我们的伴侣/妻子； 
- 爱我们自己；
- 爱我们的错误； 
- 爱我们的成功； 
- 爱我们当前的经历； 
- 爱我们的地球； 
- 爱我们的老师；
- 爱那些为我们提供经验、学习和进化的“自我”。

如果我们毫无保留地爱所有这些事物，我们就一定能避免一生的业力！

### Being Calm 

**保持冷静** 

Being of a calm demeanor and entering into everything we do in a calm and collected way, irrespective of the environment in which we find ourselves is so important. When we are confronted with adverse conditions,it is easy for us to become part of those conditions and be drawn into the lower frequencies that created them.  

无论我们身处何种环境，保持冷静的态度，沉着冷静地做每一件事都是非常重要的。当我们面对不利条件时，很容易成为这些条件的一部分，并被卷入造成这些条件的低频中。

By staying calm,we are able to rise above the drama,remain unaffected,and achieve an efficient response whilst staying within the high frequencies. In this way we can and do work with the physical whilst being "in"the physical without being "of"the physical. Thus, calmness is a state of mind that deflects the opportunity for gaining karmic content through spontaneous response.  

通过保持冷静，我们能够超越剧情，不受影响，并在高频范围内做出有效反应。这样，我们就能在身处物质之中又不属于物质的情况下与物质打交道。因此，平静是一种心境，它能转移通过自发反应获得业力内容的机会。

Remaining in calmness in all situations makes our "observer self"come into play. This ensures that the bigger picture is taken into account and allows us to respond in a respectful, thoughtful and knowledgeable way. Thus,we must strive to maintain calmness at all times. 

在任何情况下，保持冷静都会让我们的“观察者自我”发挥作用。这能确保我们考虑到大局，并以尊重、深思熟虑和知识渊博的方式做出反应。因此，我们必须时刻保持冷静。

### Thinking Before Responding 

**三思而后行** 

It is good practice the moment we wake up in the morning to think about what we can do to avoid attraction to the low frequency energies we call karma.  

从早上醒来的那一刻起，我们就应该思考如何避免被低频能量吸引，我们称之为业力。

Consciously avoiding karma takes significant practice until it is achieved on an automatic basis. If we think about everything we are doing or are about to do with a view toward the possibility of accruing karma and then think about how we can avoid it,we will make inroads into awareness of how to make this practice a regular part of our lives.  

有意识地避免业力需要大量的练习，直到自动实现。如果我们在思考自己正在做或将要做的每一件事时，都考虑到可能会累积业力，然后再思考如何避免业力，我们就会逐渐意识到如何让这种做法成为我们生活的一部分。

Once we have established "karma-safe"responses,then we can do,say and react in those ways in preference to our former instantaneous and "off the cuff"responses and reactions.  Once we get used to reacting and working in a karma-safe way,we will notice over a period of time that we are getting"lighter". This is the proof that we are attracting higher frequency energies,accruing positive karma and accelerating our evolutionary process. 

一旦我们建立了“业力安全”的反应，我们就能以这种方式去做、去说、去反应，而不是像以前那样“随心所欲”地做出反应。 一旦我们习惯了以“业力安全”的方式做出反应和工作，我们就会在一段时间内发现自己越来越轻盈。这证明我们正在吸引更高频率的能量，积累积极的业力，加速我们的进化进程。

### Communing with God to Create Heaven

**与“神”连接并创造天堂** 

When we are in the energetic,we are totally free and have instant communication with our peers and our Creator. We have no constraints and are not encumbered by a physical body, for then we are in our normal high frequency,high dimensional environment.  

当我们处于能量状态时，我们是完全自由的，可以与我们的同伴和造物主进行即时交流。我们没有任何束缚，也不受肉身的束缚，因为此时我们处于正常的高频率、高维度环境中。

When we are incarnate,we are trapped in extremely limited and slow bodies that decay,cut off our communication with our energetic peers and our Creator,and,are subject to pain, discomfort,illness and disease. In comparison to our normal energetic environment,it is hell. We can,however,alleviate the level of hellish experience by endeavoring to commune with the rest of us that is still in the energetic with our Creator,our Source Entity,our God.  

当我们化身为肉身时，我们被困在极其有限和缓慢的身体里，这些身体会衰变，切断我们与能量同伴和造物主的交流，并遭受痛苦、不适、疾病的折磨。与我们正常的能量环境相比，这简直就是地狱。然而，我们可以通过努力与我们的造物主、我们的源实体、我们的上帝交流，来减轻地狱般的体验。

By communing with God and our true selves whilst incarnate,as well as living in a way that does not attract the lower frequencies associated with the physical (karma),we can experience in some limited way that which we experience whilst in the energetic- what we may refer to as "heaven. "We can,therefore,through correct living and dedicated meditation,make "heaven"on Earth. To not do so and to go against this way of life,we can and do make our own hell on Earth!

通过在化身时与上帝和真正的自我交流，以及以不吸引与肉体（业力）相关的较低频率的方式生活，我们可以以某种有限的方式体验我们在能量中的经历——我们可以称之为“天堂”。因此，通过正确的生活和专注的冥想，我们可以在地球上创造天堂。如果不这样做，违背这种生活方式，我们就会在人间制造自己的地狱！

### Being Happy and Kind 

**快乐一些，善良一些**

It is easy to always smile when we remember our knowledge of the greater reality. Saying "Good morning"to others,always replying in a positive manner,opening the door for the person behind us,and letting the other person have the parking spot or pull out into the queue before us is a natural part of that remembrance. Why wouldn't we provide help to those who need it,assist those in need of an escort across the road,and make a habit of being kind and doing "good"things?  

当我们记住自己对更大现实的认识时，就很容易始终保持微笑。对别人说“早上好”，总是以积极的态度回答，为后面的人开门，让别人占到停车位或在我们之前把车停到队列里，这些都是这种记忆的自然组成部分。我们为什么不向那些需要帮助的人提供帮助，帮助那些需要护送过马路的人，养成善良和做“好事”的习惯呢？

These small things increase our frequencies,as well as the frequencies of those around us.  In doing these small things,we decrease our opportunities of accruing the lower frequencies associated with karma,not only for us but everyone else. This in itself is a great kindness and an even greater service as it increases joy in the world. 

这些小事能提高我们的频率，也能提高周围人的频率。在做这些小事的过程中，我们减少了与业力相关的较低频率的累积机会，不仅对我们自己如此，对其他人也是如此。这本身就是一种伟大的善举，更是一种伟大的服务，因为它增加了世界的快乐。

### Addressing Our Responsibilities 

**面对我们的责任**

Just because we are seekers of the truth,know the greater reality,and commune with God on a daily basis,it doesn't mean that we are able ignore our roles and responsibilities whilst in the physical. We planned these responsibilities as part of our experiences,our learning, and our evolution. To ignore them means our incarnation is meaningless and will result in karma with the need for us to incarnate again to fulfill the experiences set out in our previous plan.  

虽然我们是真理的追寻者，了解更伟大的现实，每天与神交流，但这并不意味着我们可以忽视我们在肉身中的角色和责任。我们计划将这些责任作为我们经历、学习和进化的一部分。忽视这些责任意味着我们的化身毫无意义，并将导致业力，使我们需要再次化身来完成之前计划中的经历。

We are here to know the greater reality,to know God and to deliver our earthly duties with skill and perfection,thus avoiding karma in the process. 

我们在这里是为了认识更伟大的现实，认识上帝，并以娴熟的技巧完美地履行我们在尘世的职责，从而在此过程中避免业力。

### Allowing Others to Have Their Beliefs 

**允许其他人拥有他们的信仰**

We must never assume that as spiritual individuals devoted to knowing the greater reality; we can convert someone else who is not yet ready to know the truth.  

我们绝不能假定，作为致力于了解更伟大现实的灵性个体，我们可以让尚未准备好了解真相的其他人改变信仰。

Forcing someone to accept another paradigm is doomed to failure and could strain or even end friendships,thus creating low frequency energy associations. Instead,it's important to love all for who they are and meditate on their liberation.  

强迫别人接受另一种模式注定会失败，而且可能会使友谊变得紧张甚至终结，从而产生低频能量关联。相反，重要的是要爱所有的人，爱他们的本来面目，冥想他们的解脱。

When a person is ready to receive the truth,we will know. 

当一个人准备好接受真相时，我们就会知道。

### Choosing Our Habits Wisely 

**明智地培养我们的习惯** 

Habits can be good or bad,but the nature of a habit is such that it is an automatic "invisible function"that we do every day. As such,it is ignored by our "physical consciousness. " 

习惯可以是好的，也可以是坏的，但习惯的本质是我们每天都在做的一种自动的“无形功能”。因此，它被我们的“生理意识”所忽略。

Attention to what a habit is and what it is not,therefore,is a necessary prelude to success in the quest for attaining self-awareness and ultimate evolution. Such understanding helps us separate good habits from bad habits.  

因此，关注习惯是什么，它不是什么，是成功实现自我意识和最终进化的必要前奏。这种理解有助于我们区分好习惯和坏习惯。

Good habits are those that lead to higher frequency existence and are ultimately supported by good like-minded people surrounding us. Good habits let us exist"within"the physical without being "of"the physical.  

好习惯是那些能带来更高频率存在的习惯，并最终得到周围志同道合的人的支持。好习惯让我们“存在于”物质之中，而不“属于”物质。

Bad habits keep our energies fixed within the low frequencies of the physical;therefore,they arrest our opportunities for evolution and perpetuate our need for incarnation. 

坏习惯让我们的能量固定在低频的物质环境中，因此，它们阻碍了我们进化的机会，让我们永远需要化身。

### Fulfilling Commitments 

**履行承诺**

Completing our commitments with joy in our hearts is important. If we have committed to do something by a certain time and/or degree to or for anyone or anything or even ourselves, we must follow through and deliver what we have committed to do.  

怀着喜悦的心情完成承诺非常重要。如果我们承诺在某个时间和/或程度之前为任何人或事，甚至为我们自己做某件事情，我们就必须坚持到底，兑现我们的承诺。

To not deliver our commitments is to relinquish responsibility for our thoughts,our intentions,our actions and our evolution. To not deliver our commitments makes that invisible commitment stay in the lower frequencies,thus,arresting our evolution. 

不兑现承诺，就等于放弃了对我们的思想、意图、行动和进化的责任。不兑现承诺会让无形的承诺停留在较低的频率上，从而阻碍我们的进化。

### Exercising Care 

**实践关爱** 

To gain high frequencies,it is imperative for us to be caring in all circumstances. For example,we must do the following: 

- Care about what we do; 
- Care about what we say; 
- Care about what we eat; 
- Care about what we drink; 
- Care about what we breathe; 
- Care about how we exercise; 
- Care about how we help; 
- Care about how we feel; 
- Care about our relationships;
- Care about how others feel; 
- Care about our physical education; 
- Care about our spiritual education; 
- Care about those we love; 
- Care about those we don't love & love them,too! 
- Care about our home; 
- Care about our friends; 
- Care about our country; 
- Care about our planet; 
- Care about our universe; 
- Care about our relationship with God;
- Care about EVERYONE and EVERYTHING because God cares about US!

要想获得高频率，我们必须在任何情况下都充满爱心。例如，我们必须做到以下几点： 

- 关心我们所做的事； 
- 关心我们所说的话； 
- 关心我们吃什么； 
- 关心我们喝什么； 
- 关心我们的呼吸； 
- 关心我们如何锻炼； 
- 关心我们如何帮助他人； 
- 关心我们的感受； 
- 关心我们的人际关系；
- 关心他人的感受； 
- 关心我们的体育； 
- 关心我们的精神教育； 
- 关心我们所爱的人； 
- 关心我们不爱的人，也爱他们！
- 关心我们的家； 
- 关心我们的朋友；
- 关心我们的国家； 
- 关心我们的地球； 
- 关心我们的宇宙； 
- 关心我们与上帝的关系；
- 关心所有人和所有事，因为上帝关心我们！

### Being Mindful 

**保持细心**

Being mindful about what we say and do is imperative. We must do everything we can to ensure that whatever we say or do is constructive and not destructive,creative and not unimaginative,positive and not negative. Being mindful will help us make a difference. 

我们必须注意自己的言行。我们必须竭尽所能，确保我们的一言一行都是建设性的，而不是破坏性的；都是创造性的，而不是缺乏想象力的；都是积极的，而不是消极的。保持清醒的头脑将有助于我们有所作为。

### Seeing the Light in All 

**看到所有人的光**

If we see the light in everyone,then everybody will see the light in us. By illustrating that we see the light in everyone and everything,we also illustrate that we see the good in everyone and everything.  

如果我们能看到每个人身上的闪光点，那么每个人也会看到我们身上的闪光点。通过说明我们在每个人和每件事物中都看到了光，我们也说明了我们在每个人和每件事物中都看到了善。

Illustrating that we see the light in everyone is a most positive step,for it is an addictive quality that breaks down barriers. 

说明我们看到了每个人身上的闪光点，这是最积极的一步，因为它是一种令人上瘾的品质，能够打破隔阂。

### Following Source Entity's Ten Commandments 

**遵循源实体的十诫**

1.Covet not another's property. Why would we want to covet the property of another, especially if the means by which we live could not support it? Living the best we can by the means we have at hand and being content,as well as remembering we are doing the best we can with what we have and the situation we find yourself in will bring us peace. Also,it helps to remember that whatever we own is only transient because this ownership is no longer ours when our physical body passes away.  

1.不要贪图他人的财产。我们为什么要觊觎他人的财产，尤其是在我们的生活来源无法支撑的情况下？用我们手头的资源尽力生活，知足常乐，并记住我们是在用我们所拥有的和我们所处的环境尽力而为，这将给我们带来平静。此外，记住我们所拥有的一切都只是短暂的，因为当我们的肉体逝去时，这种所有权就不再属于我们了。 

2.Covet not another's spouse. The reason we are with our current spouse could be because we have worked together before or because we have some issues to work out together now for mutual evolution. This is an interesting commandment,for it is often the root cause of so much karmic energy. Of course,it means anybody else's spouse other than our own.  

2.不要贪恋他人的配偶。我们之所以和现在的配偶在一起，可能是因为我们曾经共事过，也可能是因为我们现在有一些问题需要一起解决，以促进彼此的发展。这是一条有趣的戒律，因为它往往是许多业力的根源。当然，这是指除了我们自己的配偶之外，其他人的配偶。 

3.Do unto others as they do unto you. Why do we pain ourselves so much by trying to get back at others for what they do to us? It is not a creative use of our energies. We must try to put ourselves in their position,understand their issues and give them our help and love whenever we can-even if we just don't like them. Assisting them will be a big help for them,especially if they receive it from someone whom they consider to be their enemy or adversary. Maybe if we see the good in them,they will,too. If we don't,we create frustration and karma when we should be in acceptance and move on with love in our heart.  

3.己所不欲，勿施于人。为什么我们会因为别人对我们做了什么而试图报复别人，从而让自己如此痛苦呢？这不是对我们精力的创造性利用。我们必须试着设身处地地为他们着想，理解他们的问题，并尽可能地给予他们帮助和关爱——即使我们只是不喜欢他们。帮助他们会给他们带来很大的帮助，尤其是当他们从他们认为是敌人或对手的人那里得到帮助时。如果我们看到他们身上的优点，也许他们也会看到。如果我们不这样做，我们就会产生挫折感和业力，而此时我们应该怀着爱去接受和继续前进。

4.Help others less able than ourselves. This is a fundamental rule,for it is the one that has the most opportunities attached to it to help us evolve. The point here is that we should give help to those who need it when the opportunity presents itself. We must remember we are all from the same spirit,the same Source. Why be selfish with our good health? Sharing it with others now opens the door for others to share theirs with us when our time comes to be less able-thus,coming full circle.  

4.帮助能力不如自己的人。这是一条最基本的规则，因为它为我们的发展提供了最多的机会。这里的重点是，当机会来临时，我们应该帮助那些需要帮助的人。我们必须记住，我们都来自同一个精神，同一个源泉。为什么要自私地对待我们的健康呢？现在与他人分享健康，就为他人打开了一扇门，当我们的能力减弱时，他人也可以与我们分享他们的健康--这就是一个完整的循环。 

5.Help others less fortunate than yourself. As with #4 this is fundamental. Whereas #4 is aligned to the physical aspects of the human condition,this rule is closer to the situation that others find themselves in. Again,we are reminded to help others when the opportunity presents itself. The help can be as benign as shopping for them,servicing their car or buying them a meal when they need it. 

5.帮助比自己不幸的人。与 #4 一样，这也是最基本的。第4条与人类的物质条件相一致，而这条规则更接近于他人所处的境况。我们再次被提醒要在机会出现时帮助他人。这种帮助可以是善意的，比如帮他们购物、维修他们的汽车，或者在他们需要的时候请他们吃一顿饭。 

6.The universe is yours forever. Why do we get hung up on ownership of physical things when the whole universe is ours for the taking when we take the time to realize it and work with it? As humanity we are hung up on ownership of the Earth,but no one owns the Earth.  It is an entity in its own right. Once we realize that,we are able to go anywhere at any time and enjoy the universe and the earth in its entirety,so why would we want to pin ourselves down to a small section of it? Ownership of land and other physical things is okay as a comfort blanket,but in real terms when we are fully awakened to the reality that is around us,we really don't need to own or link ourselves to anything.  

6.宇宙永远属于你。当我们花时间去认识它并与之合作时，整个宇宙都是我们的，为什么我们还要纠结于对物质的所有权呢？作为人类，我们对地球的所有权耿耿于怀，但没有人拥有地球。 它本身就是一个实体。一旦我们意识到这一点，我们就能随时随地享受宇宙和地球的全部，为什么我们要把自己局限于地球的一小部分呢？对土地和其他有形事物的所有权可以作为一种安慰，但实际上，当我们对周围的现实完全觉醒时，我们真的不需要拥有任何东西，也不需要把自己与任何东西联系在一起。

7.Worship not graven idols. This is relatively easy to follow in this day and age,for there is a greater level of understanding than there was a couple of thousand years ago. In essence this also works for churches as well,for they are a larger version of the graven idol. Why worship the physical when we can meditate upon gaining access to the energetic/spiritual? The initial use of an idol was to give the initiate (a student of the truth,real truth!)something to focus upon when engaging in deep meditation. It has since been taken completely out of context and is no longer a requirement in today's society.  

7.不崇拜人造偶像。在当今时代，这一点相对容易遵循，因为人们的理解水平比几千年前更高了。从本质上讲，这也适用于教会，因为它们是更大版本的偶像。既然我们可以冥想获得能量/灵性，为什么还要崇拜物质呢？偶像的最初用途是让入门者（真理的学生，真正的真理！）在进行深度冥想时有所侧重。后来它被完全断章取义，不再是当今社会的要求。 

8.Honor your parents. This is mainly due to the need to help our parents when their physical bodies decay to the point where they are no longer able to contribute to the community in the way they used to. This is especially relevant in the last few thousand years when the knowledge and command of the energies of the universe have been lost to most of those who are incarnate. The older generation has all the knowledge of the past to give us and our children. Without them we would not appreciate our roots and would lose the fundamentals. Without the fundamentals the house of knowledge is but a pack of cards arranged in the shape of a house. There have been many incarnate races that have been laid bare,exposed to the elements,and nowhere to go as a result of catastrophe because they no longer had sight of the basic fundamentals.  

8.孝敬父母。这主要是因为当我们的父母身体衰弱到无法再像以前那样为社会做出贡献时，我们需要帮助他们。在过去的几千年里，这一点尤为重要，因为大多数化身为人的人已经失去了对宇宙能量的了解和掌控。老一代人拥有过去的所有知识，可以传授给我们和我们的后代。没有他们，我们就不会珍惜我们的根，就会失去根本。没有基础知识，知识的殿堂也不过是一堆摆成房子形状的纸牌。曾经有许多化身为人的种族，因为不再关注基本要素，而在灾难中变得赤裸裸、风吹日晒、无处可去。

9.Do not tell lies about your neighbor. This is again another general issue that is a major opportunity to gain karmic energy and slow down our evolution by being dragged down the frequencies. Why would we want to tell lies anyway? If we have done something wrong,we must own up to it and accept that we are in an opportunity to experience something else in the physical that will be of benefit later. This also covers the terrible habit of gossiping about someone to try to gain favor with others around us. Eventually this backfires and costs us more karmic energy than we originally accrued. Worse still,it also "costs"those we gossiped about (unless they are more highly evolved)as they generally will want to "get one back"on us,which invokes karmic energy.  

9.不要对你的邻居撒谎。这也是另一个普遍问题，它是获得业力的重要机会，也会拖累我们的进化频率。我们为什么要撒谎呢？如果我们做错了什么，我们必须承认错误，并接受我们正处于一个体验其他物质的机会中，这将在以后对我们有益。这也包括我们为了博得周围人的好感而说别人闲话的坏习惯。最终，这种做法会适得其反，让我们付出比最初积累的更多的业力。更糟糕的是，这也会让那些被我们说闲话的人（除非他们的进化程度更高）“付出代价”，因为他们通常会想要“报复”我们，这也会招致业力。

10.Steal not from your neighbor. Why steal at all? This is not necessary as what we have with us is all that we need to experience life in the physical according to the plan we laid out. The Lord/we shall provide,and we do. Everything is provided to ensure that our "sortie" on Earth in the lower frequencies is maintained at its most optimal evolutionary condition.  This is another way to gain massive karmic energy because invariably we end up lying to cover ourselves if we steal. 

10.不要偷邻居的东西。为什么要偷呢？这没有必要，因为根据我们制定的计划，我们所拥有的东西就是我们体验物质生活所需的一切。主/我们会提供，而且我们确实提供了。我们所提供的一切，都是为了确保我们在地球上的低频“飞行”能保持在最佳进化状态。 这是另一种获得巨大业力能量的方式，因为如果我们偷窃，最终总会以撒谎来掩饰自己。

### Practicing Patience 

**锻炼耐心**

Being patient with everyone,everything,and especially ourselves is an excellent practice.  Adopting a calm and patient demeanor attracts higher frequency energies and high frequency friends.  

对每个人、每件事，尤其是对我们自己保持耐心是一种极好的修炼方法。采取冷静和耐心的态度会吸引更高频率的能量和高频率的朋友。 

When we are patient and calm,we provide an excellent example to others of how to live in the frantic world of the gross physical whilst avoiding lower frequency addictions associated with being restless. 

当我们保持耐心和冷静时，我们就为他人树立了一个很好的榜样，告诉他们如何在疯狂的物质世界中生活，同时避免因焦躁不安而导致的低频上瘾。

### Having No Expectation of Reward 

**不执着于对回报的预期**

Expectation can be considered the opposite function of desire,specifically when we expect a reward for being of service. Doing so also ties us into the low frequency desires of the physical and,therefore,delivers a level of karma.  

期望可以说是欲望的相反功能，特别是当我们期望通过服务获得回报时。这样做也会把我们与低频的物质欲望联系在一起，因此会造成一定程度的业力。 

Expectation is something to be avoided from a more personal perspective,especially when we "expect"a certain response or action from a friend or colleague.  

从更个人的角度来看，期望是应该避免的，尤其是当我们“期望”朋友或同事做出某种反应或行动时。 

Expecting nothing,we will gain two things: 

如果不抱任何期望，我们将获得两样东西： 

1.Freedom from the karmic link that expectation gives us;

1.摆脱期望给我们带来的业力联系；

2.Joy when a friend or colleague responds in the correct or most spiritually desirable way. 

2.当朋友或同事以正确或精神上最理想的方式做出回应时，我们会感到喜悦。

### Anticipating Nothing 

**不期待任何事** 

Anticipation is based upon expectation,therefore,it links us to a "desired"result. When we remove expectation,we will also remove anticipation,for the one creates the other.  

预期是建立在期望之上的，因此，它将我们与“期望”的结果联系在一起。当我们消除期望时，也就消除了预期，因为两者相辅相成。 

When we remove both conditions from our minds,we negate the opportunity for us to enter into the"closed loop"of continuous cause and effect that creates the one or the other. Thus, it is wise for us to leave anticipation and expectation to their own devices. 

当我们把这两个条件都从头脑中去除时，我们就失去了进入闭环的机会，因为闭环中的连续因果关系会产生这样或那样的结果。因此，让期待和预期自生自灭才是明智之举。

### Accepting Divine Providence in All Situations 

**在所有情况下接受神圣的安排**

When we anticipate an outcome,we paint a picture of what we desire,thus identifying that outcome as positive or a negative,based upon the outcome we anticipated.  

当我们预期一个结果时，我们就会描绘出一幅我们所期望的画面，从而根据我们预期的结果来确定这个结果是积极的还是消极的。 

Anticipation of an outcome is a human condition that ultimately links us to the physical.  

对结果的预期是人类的一种状态，它最终将我们与物质联系在一起。 

When we are able to be in the "now,"thereby removing the element of anticipation,we are working in acceptance that divine providence will prevail and bring the outcome that is the best for a particular situation. 

当我们能够置身于当下，从而消除预期因素时，我们就会接受神的旨意将占上风，并带来最适合特定情况的结果。

### Recognizing Situations as Opportunities for Evolution 

**认识到某些情形是进化的机会**

Anticipation is a limiting thought process that is based upon our expectation of a desired outcome with desire being defined as "a condition of specific focus on the material. " 

预期是一种限制性思维过程，它建立在我们对预期结果的期望之上。

Anticipation results from our expectation of a preferred outcome. In this case,our focus is on the outcome rather than the wider spiritual process that results in the outcome. Should the anticipated outcome not be that which we expected,then we become dissatisfied and/ or are disappointed. When we feel this way,it is as a result of our working with the smaller "incarnate picture"rather than observing the result or outcome from the larger spiritual perspective. We must remember that no matter what the outcome,what is experienced is designed to help us evolve.  

期待源于我们对理想结果的期望。在这种情况下，我们关注的是结果，而不是产生结果的更广泛的精神过程。如果预期的结果不符合我们的期望，我们就会感到不满和/或失望。当我们有这种感觉时，是因为我们只关注了较小的“化身图景”，而没有从更大的灵性角度来观察结果或成果。我们必须记住，无论结果如何，所经历的一切都是为了帮助我们进化。 

We should,therefore,accept situations presented in life as evolutionary opportunities rather than planning for certain "anticipated"outcomes and wasting time thinking about where and when the outcomes may happen and what they will be. 

因此，我们应该把生活中出现的情况当作进化的机会来接受，而不是为某些预期的结果做计划，浪费时间去思考这些结果可能会在何时何地发生，会是什么样子。

### Accepting Frustration 

**接受挫折** 

Frustration is a product of desire turning into anticipation and expectation. It is based upon our inability to wait for that which will come with divine providence at the correct juncture in our incarnate existence. 

挫败感是欲望转化为期待和期望的产物。它的基础是我们无法在我们化身存在的正确时刻等待神的旨意。 

Frustration is also borne from our inability to succeed in our plans. When we do this,it is the result of our not adapting to the learning opportunities that are presented to us to evolve;instead,we choose to overlay these experiences with preferred outcomes instead of the actual outcomes.  

挫败感也源于我们的计划无法成功。当我们这样做的时候，是因为我们没有适应为我们提供的学习机会，而是选择将这些经验与我们希望的结果而不是实际结果叠加在一起。 

Frustration can be avoided by expecting nothing whilst accepting everything and living in the product of the divine plan. 

只要我们不抱任何期望，同时接受一切，活在神圣计划的产物中，就能避免挫败感。

### Being Impatient,a Predecessor to Frustration 

**不耐烦是挫折的前奏**

Impatience is a precursor to frustration and its associated emotional responses. It is a product of our being in the physical whilst retaining an energetic memory of working within the energetic. Whilst in the energetic,we are able to affect changes instantaneously through pure intention that creates thought and later action based upon that thought.  

不耐烦是挫折感及其相关情绪反应的先兆。它是我们在物质世界中的产物，同时保留着在能量世界中工作的能量记忆。在能量状态下，我们能够通过纯粹的意念瞬间影响变化，这种意念会产生思想，随后根据思想采取行动。 

In the low frequencies of the physical universe,this is not possible,but our memory of such function remains within us while incarnate-hence,our frustration when "things"do not happen. In this instance the antidote is to remain calm and wait patiently for the fruits of our work to come into fruition.  

在低频的物理宇宙中，这是不可能实现的，但我们对这种功能的记忆在我们化身为人时仍然存在，因此，当事情没有发生时，我们会感到沮丧。在这种情况下，解药就是保持冷静，耐心等待我们的工作取得成果。 

Impatience begins with its link to low frequency thoughts and desire for "instant gratification,"a product of "modern times,"where we simply "cannot wait"for this or that to occur. This pulls down our frequencies and negates the higher frequency thoughts of calmness and the joy of waiting for that which has been manifest to come into fruition.  We deprive ourselves of wondering in awe at the processes that work behind the scenes to finalize that which has been manifested through intention,thought and action.

不耐烦首先与低频思想和即时满足的欲望有关，这是现代的产物，我们根本等不及发生这样或那样的事情。这降低了我们的频率，抵消了平静的高频思想和等待已显现的事物实现的喜悦。我们无法以敬畏的心情去感叹那些通过意念、思维和行动最终实现的幕后过程。

### Feeling Dissatisfied and Impatient 

**不满意和不耐烦**

We mustn't be impatient;we must watch out for impatience. It is a function of anticipative desire and is steeped in the expectation of that which may or may not happen.  

我们不能急躁，我们必须警惕急躁。急躁是一种预期欲望的作用，沉浸在对可能发生或可能不发生的事情的期待中。 

Impatience is created when we are dissatisfied with that which we have,are,or expect to be, or from a temporal perspective,expect to be or have earlier.  

当我们对我们所拥有的、正在拥有的或期望拥有的感到不满时，或者从时间的角度来看，期望更早拥有或拥有时，就会产生急躁。 

As time does not exist in the energetic,impatience is,therefore,futile. We must trust that everything happens when it is supposed to happen to give us the correct level of experiential/learning content that will allow our flawless evolution to occur. 

由于时间并不存在于能量中，因此不耐烦是徒劳的。我们必须相信，一切都会在它应该发生的时候发生，给我们提供正确的体验/学习内容，让我们完美无瑕地进化。

### Experiencing Contentment as a Double-Edged Sword 

**“体验满足”是把双刃剑**

When we are content,we are ripe for working with the physical whilst being "in"the physical but not "of"the physical. We are not drawn to those lower frequency attractions of materialism that create a karmic link to the physical and arrest our personal ascension through the frequencies. We can soar above these lower frequencies and go ever onwards and upwards towards constant communion with our Creator. 

当我们满足的时候，我们就可以与物质打交道了，我们在物质中，但不属于物质。我们不会被那些低频的物质主义所吸引，因为它们会造成与物质的业力联系，阻碍我们通过频率的提升。我们可以超越这些较低的频率，不断向上，不断与造物主交流。 

However,if we are content with our spiritual progress and happy where we are,doing what we're doing and experiencing communion with spirit,we will never progress beyond that which is really just localized spirit. We will not reach the dizzying heights required to ensure constant communion with our Creator. 

然而，如果我们满足于自己的精神进步，满足于自己的现状，满足于做自己正在做的事情，满足于体验与精神的交流，那么我们就永远不会超越那实际上只是局部精神的进步。我们将无法达到确保与造物主不断交流所需的令人眩晕的高度。

### Offering Unconditional Love 

**给予无条件的爱**

Offering love-that is,unconditional love-is the most wonderful thing that we can give to one another. This should not be reserved for those that we know,love,trust,revere and respect,however. It should also be given to those that we "initially"don't know,fear,hate, loathe,dislike or distrust,for we are all part of the Source Entity. They are,therefore,part of us. Recognizing and experientially knowing this is a major step for us on the road to high frequency existence. 

给予爱——即无条件的爱——是我们能够给予彼此的最美好的东西。然而，这种爱不应该只给予那些我们认识、热爱、信任、尊敬和尊重的人。它也应该给予那些我们最初不了解、恐惧、憎恨、厌恶、不喜欢或不信任的人，因为我们都是源实体的一部分。因此，他们也是我们的一部分。认识并体验到这一点，是我们在通往高频率存在的道路上迈出的重要一步。

### Sharing Kindness 

**分享善良**

When we are kind or offer kindness to anyone,whatever the circumstances,we take a step on our road to high frequency existence,for being kind is a prelude to unconditional love of one and all. 

无论在什么情况下，当我们善待或善待任何人时，我们就在通往高频率存在的道路上迈出了一步，因为善待是无条件地爱所有人的前奏。

### Perpetuating Karma 

**延续业力**

The universe does not run on karma. We as mankind create it through infatuation with the low frequencies associated with the physical. Why do we perpetuate that which does not naturally exist? 

宇宙不是靠业力运转的。我们人类通过迷恋与物质相关的低频来创造业力。我们为什么要延续那些并非自然存在的东西呢？

### Evading a Competitive Mindset 

**回避竞争心态** 

We must avoid being in competition with others on all levels,including spiritual levels.  Competition occurs when we are enticed into trying to become like someone else-someone who seems to have spiritual skills or abilities that we feel we lack and desire to have. We see this person as being better than we are and strive to become better than this individual is.  

我们必须避免在各个层面（包括精神层面）与他人竞争。 当我们被引诱去努力变得像别人——某个人似乎拥有我们觉得自己缺乏并渴望拥有的灵性技能或能力时，竞争就出现了。在我们看来，这个人比我们更优秀，因此我们会努力变得比这个人更优秀。 

In circumstances like this,we forget that we are individual beings on our own paths. As such,we should and must concentrate on what we are doing in our own way and not try to be equal to or better than those around us. We need to just be ourselves and evolve by our own work in our own perfection and in our own time. 

在这种情况下，我们会忘记自己是走在自己人生道路上的个体。因此，我们应该也必须专注于我们自己正在做的事情，而不是试图与周围的人平起平坐或比他们更好。我们只需要做我们自己，在我们自己的时间里，通过我们自己的工作，在我们自己的完美中不断进步。

### Being Complacent About Complacency 

**落入自满**

Complacency is the right hand man of karma. It waits for us when we feel that we have addressed all the spiritual issues that we need to work on and now need to do no more.  

自满是业力的得力助手。当我们觉得自己已经解决了所有需要解决的精神问题，现在不需要再做什么时，它就在等着我们。 

When we are convinced that the work is done,we are actually just about to start,for the task of working towards God and perfection is a lifetime's work,requiring constant diligence, introspection and re-calibration of spiritual achievement. 

当我们确信工作已经完成时，实际上我们才刚刚开始，因为向上帝和完美迈进是一项终生的工作，需要不断地勤奋、反省和重新调整精神成就。

### Accepting Everything 

**接受一切**

Resistance to that which happens in life that we consider to be sub-optimal is resistance to learning from those opportunities presented to us as lessons in how to disassociate ourselves from certain events-those events borne in physicality.  

抵制生活中发生的、我们认为不理想的事情，就是抵制从这些机会中学习，学习如何将自己与某些事件——那些在实体中发生的事件——分离开来。 

Our acceptance neutralizes resistance and negates our need to re-experience that which is experienced but resisted. When we neutralize resistance,acceptance can and does remove the opportunity for the karmic influence that resistance introduces. 

我们的接受中和了阻力，并否定了我们重新体验已经历过但被抵制的事物的需要。当我们中和了阻力，接受就能消除阻力带来的业力影响。

### Learning by Observation 

**从观察中学习**

When we observe those around us who are not aware of the greater reality,we often note how they work for the good of themselves and not for the good of everyone else and their Creator.  

当我们观察周围那些没有意识到更大现实的人时，我们常常会注意到他们是如何为自己的利益而工作，而不是为其他人和造物主的利益而工作。 

Although we will not be able to change them,they "gift"us a constant reminder of what we could become if we let ourselves slip back into the belief that physical existence is the only reality.  

虽然我们无法改变他们，但他们“赠予”我们的礼物时刻提醒着我们，如果我们让自己重新陷入“物质存在是唯一现实”的信念中，我们会变成什么样。 

With this in mind,we will continue to work hard at being of service,meditating on our Creator,and experiencing the greater reality. 

有鉴于此，我们将继续努力为人类服务，冥想造物主，体验更伟大的现实。

### Comparing Ourselves with Others 

**将自己与他人进行比较**

We must avoid comparing ourselves with others. Once we embark upon the road of comparison with our friends,relatives,neighbors and peers,we run the risk of becoming dissatisfied with ourselves and our "transient"Earthly possessions.  

我们必须避免与他人比较。一旦我们走上与朋友、亲戚、邻居和同龄人比较的道路，我们就有可能对自己和短暂的尘世财产感到不满。 

Dissatisfaction is an insidious link to physical existence and one that demands us to be vigilant. 

不满意是与物质存在的一种隐性联系，需要我们保持警惕。

### Living as Transient Custodians

**作为临时监护人来生活** 

It's imperative for us to remember that we are only custodians of that which we have around us whilst in the physical. We never actually own anything. Instead,we are only given the opportunity to work with,live with,and maintain that which we buy for the period of time we are incarnate. 

我们必须记住，我们只是我们周围物质的保管人。我们从未真正拥有过任何东西。相反，我们只是有机会在我们化身为人的这段时间里，与我们所购买的东西一起工作、一起生活、一起维护。

### Disconnecting the Physical from the Energetic Self 

**断开物质形态与能量本我的联系**

Physical pain is a constant reminder that we are in a physical vehicle that is limited by the thought processes of being incarnate. 

身体上的疼痛时刻提醒着我们，我们所处的身体载体受到了化身为人的思维过程的限制。

“Limited”and“thought'"are the operative words here for when we are not“limited"by the "thought constraints"of being in physical form and are able to work with the greater reality of being "in"the physical but not "of"the physical,then we realize that the physical form is a transient condition. As such,it is used for transitory moments of experience whilst we are in the lower frequencies that are associated with the physical universe.  

这里的“限制”和“思维”是关键字，因为当我们不再受肉身思维约束的限制，并能以“在”肉身而非“于”肉身的更大现实来工作时，我们就会意识到肉身只是一种短暂的状态。因此，当我们处于与物质宇宙相关的较低频率时，它是用来获得短暂体验的。 

When we realize-truly realize to the core of our being-this truth,we are able to disconnect our physical selves from our energetic selves and thus remove our mental link to the lower frequencies. In this way,by disconnecting our energetic selves from the function of pain in the physical vehicle we inhabit,we can live a pain-free physical existence and negate the karmic link in the process.  

当我们意识到——真正意识到我们存在的核心——这一真理时，我们就能够将我们的物质自我与我们的能量自我断开，从而消除我们与低频的精神联系。这样，通过切断我们的能量自我与我们所居住的物质载体的疼痛功能，我们就能过上无痛的物质生活，并在这一过程中消除业力联系。 

Such mastery of the physical requires dedicated,continuous,unwavering,focused,robust and intention-based thought 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

这种对身体的掌控需要每周7天、每天24小时的专注、持续、坚定、集中、有力和以意图为基础的思考。

### Being Vigilant of Addictive Sensations 

**警惕上瘾的快感**

Physical pain is a constant reminder that we are in a physical vehicle. Likewise,sexual sensations and other bodily addictions are also a reminder that we are limited by the thought/experience processes of the vehicle we are incarnated within.  

身体上的疼痛会不断提醒我们，我们是在一个物质载体中。同样，性感觉和其他身体上的瘾也在提醒我们，我们受限于我们所化身的载体的思维/体验过程。 

Clearly some of the sensations we feel whilst incarnate are a joy to experience. Some, like sexual sensations,can be addictive. Others,such as touch,taste,smell and sight are sensations that are limited to our being incarnate. In the energetic we are above these sensations and,therefore,not affected by their potential additive qualities. In our need to be incarnate to aid our evolutionary commitment,we subsequently experience multiple sensations on a daily basis,some of which are a link to the low frequencies of the physical.  We must be vigilant of sensations,for they can be insidious in their addictive qualities. 

显然，我们化身为人时所感受到的一些感觉是一种快乐的体验。有些感觉，比如性感觉，会让人上瘾。其他感觉，如触觉、味觉、嗅觉和视觉，则仅限于我们的化身。在能量中，我们凌驾于这些感觉之上，因此不会受到它们潜在的附加品质的影响。由于我们需要化身来帮助我们实现进化的承诺，因此我们每天都会体验到多种感觉，其中一些感觉与物质的低频有关。我们必须对这些感觉保持警惕，因为它们可能会使人上瘾。

### Using Desire with Care 

**谨慎运用愿望**

It's important for us to be aware of our desires,for they are a route to the lower frequencies.  If our desires are relative to things of the physical,then they will anchor us to the physical. If our desire is to commune with our Creator,our Source Entity-God,then our desire will be a route towards the higher frequencies and bring positive karma to us. 

我们必须意识到自己的欲望，因为它们是通往低频的途径。 如果我们的欲望与物质有关，那么它们就会把我们固定在物质上。如果我们的愿望是与我们的造物主、我们的源头实体——神交流，那么我们的愿望就会成为通往较高频率的途径，并给我们带来积极的业力。

### Being in Debt 

**负债**

In our earthly incarnate form,we must avoid indebtedness to anyone and anything either financially,materially,or in any other form. Debt is a control factor that leaves us under the control of the debtor. Debt of any kind links us to the physical. It ties us into the commitment of paying back the debt with interest,thereby compounding the debt and creating low frequency thoughts,such as resentment and anger,towards the debtor.  

我们在尘世中化身为人，必须避免在经济、物质或其他任何形式上欠任何人和任何事的债。债务是一种控制因素，使我们处于债务人的控制之下。任何形式的债务都将我们与物质联系在一起。它将我们与连本带利偿还债务的承诺联系在一起，从而使债务复杂化，并产生对债务人的低频想法，如怨恨和愤怒。 

We should only have and recognize one debt,the one we all sign up to experience during our incarnation. We agree to experience,learn,evolve and share this evolutionary content,this debt of creation,with our Creator whilst maintaining this evolutionary content ourselves.  This is not a physical debt,linking us to the low frequencies of the physical;instead,it is a debt of pleasure,of joy,of delight,of love,and of desire to help our Creator evolve by our individual efforts.  

我们应该只拥有并认识到一种债务，那就是我们每个人在化身过程中都要经历的债务。我们同意体验、学习、进化，并与造物主分享这种进化内容，这种创造之债，同时我们自己也要保持这种进化内容。这不是一种将我们与低频的物质联系在一起的物质债务；相反，这是一种快乐、喜悦、喜悦、爱的债务，以及通过我们的个人努力帮助造物主进化的愿望。 

In this instance the best way for us to move forward is not to protect ourselves from the low energies associated with such thoughts but more to be in acceptance that we have placed ourselves in that position. We can,therefore,elevate our frequencies when we recognize the opportunity for personal growth from such a situation. We then work in joy at the prospect of paying back with interest that which is owed as a thank you to the debtor for helping us out when required. We do this without resenting ourselves for being in the situation or for the debtor charging interest-thereby,we break a karmic link. 

在这种情况下，我们向前迈进的最佳方式不是保护自己免受与这种想法相关的低能量的影响，而是接受我们将自己置于这种境地的事实。因此，当我们意识到这种情况为个人成长提供了机会时，我们就能提升自己的频率。然后，我们就会满怀喜悦地偿还所欠债务，并支付利息，以感谢债务人在需要时对我们的帮助。这样做时，我们不会因为自己处于这种境地或债务人收取利息而怨恨自己，从而打破了业力联系。

### Feeling Betrayal

**感受背叛** 

Betrayal is an emotion we feel when our expectations of reward and recognition are not manifested. Indeed,betrayal is even more profound when we work for another,and the fruits of our hard work and the recognition we seek or expect is claimed by another. Betrayal can and ultimately does cause resentment,especially if we do not recognize and neutralize it by seeking higher advice or accessing higher knowledge on the need and requirement of the betrayer to commit the act of betrayal.  

当我们对回报和认可的期望落空时，我们就会产生背叛的情绪。事实上，当我们为他人工作，而我们辛勤工作的成果和我们所寻求或期望的认可却被他人夺走时，背叛感会更加强烈。背叛可能而且最终确实会引起怨恨，尤其是如果我们没有通过寻求更高的建议或获取更高的知识来认识和中和背叛者实施背叛行为的必要性和要求的话。 

When we are betrayed in some way,we must use that opportunity as a chance to gain evolutionary content. It is important for us to take the position of the "observer self"and look at the reasons for the betrayer's need to deceive us. We have the opportunity to take true pity on this individual and freely give that which was taken without asking. When we do this,we re-direct the energies of betrayal to the energies of being in service-in service to the betrayer. We can then love this person and be in total and instantaneous forgiveness because this individual has given us the opportunity to take the function of betrayal and use it to increase our personal frequencies by acknowledging this as a chance to add to our growth experiences so we can learn and evolve instead of projecting anger,hatred and/or resentment at the betrayer. 

当我们以某种方式遭到背叛时，我们必须利用这个机会获得进化的内容。我们必须站在“观察者自我”的立场上，审视背叛者欺骗我们的原因。我们有机会真正地同情这个人，并无偿地给予他不问自取的东西。当我们这样做时，我们就会把背叛的能量重新引导到为背叛者服务的能量上。这样，我们就能爱这个人，并立即完全原谅他，因为这个人给了我们机会，让我们利用背叛的功能，通过承认这是一个增加我们成长经历的机会，从而提高我们的个人频率，这样我们就能学习和发展，而不是对背叛者投射愤怒、仇恨和/或怨恨。

### Accepting Rather Than Resenting 

**接受而非怨恨** 

Resentment,a particularly low frequency response,is a function of betrayal,expectation, personal comparison,and non-acceptance. Although it is a secondary function,caused by those other low frequency responses just noted,it masks the primary reasons for its existence and,therefore,masks its existence per se. When we are locked in the downward spiral of resentment,we place ourselves in the "poor me"and "why them"category of individual thought processes.  

怨恨是一种特别低频的反应，是背叛、期望、个人比较和不接受的功能。虽然它是由其他低频反应引起的次要功能，但它掩盖了其存在的主要原因，因此也掩盖了它本身的存在。当我们陷入怨恨的恶性循环时，我们就会把自己置于“我真可怜”和“为什么是他们”的个人思维过程中。 

The antidote to resentment is our total acceptance of that which caused the primary function to come into existence. This is achieved by our using the detached "observer self" function,which allows us to recognize the processes and events that led us to be in this mental condition. In so doing,we should then forgive ourselves for taking such a route and forgive,accept and love those whose personal positions we have observed and considered to be better than our own. Even if they do appear to receive something for nothing and always be in the right place at the right time,we need to recognize that this is what they have agreed to experience whilst in the low frequencies of the physical universe,and this will enable them to experience,learn and evolve as all other incarnates do-in their own way. 

怨恨的解药是我们完全接受导致主要功能产生的原因。要做到这一点，我们需要使用超脱的“观察自我”功能，它能让我们认识到导致我们陷入这种心理状态的过程和事件。在这样做的同时，我们应该原谅自己走了这样一条路，并原谅、接受和爱那些我们观察到并认为其个人立场比自己好的人。即使他们看起来不劳而获，总是在正确的时间出现在正确的地点，我们也要认识到，这是他们在低频的物质宇宙中同意经历的，这将使他们能够像所有其他化身一样，以自己的方式经历、学习和进化。

### Refusing to Ignore a Request for Help 

**拒绝忽视求助之声**

Have you ever noticed that sometimes we ignore a fellow incarnate that needs help? We do this in myriad situations as we move quickly past the person in need lest we become involved,such as a beggar in the street,someone in a car accident,or a person in an abusive situation. After we've done this,we feel ill at ease. This is the feeling of energy being sent from the person "in need"to us,requesting our help and being ignored. This causes disharmony. If we get the feeling that we SHOULD help another,then we MUST help.  

你有没有注意到有时我们忽略了需要帮助的同类？在无数情况下，我们会这样做，因为我们快速地从需要帮助的人身边走过，以免卷入其中，比如街上的乞丐，车祸中的人，或处于虐待境地中的人。我们这样做之后，我们感到不安。这是“需要帮助”的人向我们发出的能量，请求我们的帮助，却被我们忽略的感觉。这导致了不和谐。如果我们感到我们应该帮助别人，那么我们必须帮助。

The discomfort felt in ignoring the request for help is also an indication that there is a need to help,based upon a pre-incarnation commitment between the person in need and us to work with each other. Notice how the common thought,"I should have helped there-but I didn't"lingers for a long time.  This is our opportunity to turn back and be the help that is requested.  It's also wise to remember that this may be an opportunity for clearing karma. Ignoring that feeling may create more karma or re-enforce the existing karmic link. Why take that risk when we can help the person and go home with a song in our heart? 

忽略求助请求所感到的不适也表明了有必要提供帮助，基于需要帮助的人和我们之间在投生前相互合作的承诺。注意这个共同的想法是如何萦绕很长时间的，“我应该帮助那里的，但我没有”。这是我们回头并成为被要求的帮助的机会。记住这可能是清理业力的机会也是明智的。忽略这种感觉可能会创造更多的业力或重新加强现有的业力联系。当我们可以帮助别人，并带着心中的一首歌回家时，为什么要冒这个险呢？

### Tuning into Others 

**“调谐收听”他人**

When we "tune in"to the greater reality of others who need help,we gain a higher level of understanding and ultimately validate their needs or not as the case may be,for our help-our service.  

当我们“调谐”到需要帮助的其他人的更大现实中时，我们获得更高层次的理解，并最终根据情况来确定他们是否需要我们的帮助——我们的服务。

If we "tune in"and feel that it is not necessary for us to be their liberator-and this is not a "way out"of being of service-then we can move on because there is no karmic link between us. However,we must ensure that the "tuning in"takes into account the possibility of creating karma-even if no karmic link was initially apparent.  

如果我们“调谐”并感到我们没有必要成为他们的解放者——这不是服务的一个“出路”——那么我们可以继续前进，因为我们之间没有业力联系。然而，我们必须确保“调谐”考虑到创造业力的可能性——即使最初没有明显的业力联系。

Just because there is no link between us and someone else,it does not mean that a link cannot be created through neglecting the opportunity to be of service.  

仅仅因为我们和别人之间没有联系，并不意味着通过忽视服务的机会就不能创造联系。

Those who request help but do not need it run the risk of creating their own karma-hence, the need for us to "tune in"first. In this instance when we gracefully decline helping the individuals,we are helping to ensure that they do not accrue karma linked to us through false requests. Thus it is that we are being of greater service in this instance. 

那些请求帮助但并不需要它的人冒着创造他们自己的业力的风险——因此，我们需要首先“调谐”。在这种情况下，当我们优雅地拒绝帮助个人时，我们正在帮助确保他们不会通过虚假的请求积累与我们相关的业力。因此，在这种情况下，我们正在提供更大的服务。

### Taking One Day at a Time 

**过好每一天**

What if we were to start every day as if it was a new day,as if it was our first day on earth?  We would have no troubles,we would have no enemies,we would have no worries,and we would have no concerns.  

如果我们开始每一天，就好像它是新的一天，就好像它是我们来到这个世界上的第一天，会怎么样？ 我们就没有麻烦，没有敌人，没有烦恼，没有忧虑。

What if we considered that those things we have to do are a joy to do,that they are a challenge to be enjoyed,that those whom we meet are also a joy to meet for it is the first time we have met them,and it is the first time they have met us? We could ask what we could do for them without the need for reward.  

如果我们认为那些我们必须做的事情是一件愉快的事情，是值得享受的挑战，我们遇到的人也是一件愉快的事情，因为这是我们第一次遇到他们，也是他们第一次遇到我们。我们可以问问我们能为他们做些什么，而不要求回报。

What if we considered that the area we exist within is a joy to be in,an opportunity for improvement,an opportunity for positivity,and we could be in the now and work in the now?  

如果我们认为我们生存的地方是一件愉快的事情，是提高的机会，是积极向上的机会，我们可以活在当下，活在此刻，会怎么样？

In this state of mind we have no prejudices,no preconceptions,no fears,no insurmountable actions that are impossible to complete-just the joy of being here,of being able to participate and be of service. We are at peace. 

在这种心态下，我们没有偏见，没有先入之见，没有恐惧，没有无法完成的不可克服的行动——只有活在这里的快乐，能够参与并为他人服务的快乐。我们是和平的。

### Respecting Our Environment and Ourselves 

**尊重我们的环境和我们自己** 

When we respect our environment,the land,the trees,the sea and the animals,we respect ourselves.  

当我们尊重我们的环境，土地，树木，海洋和动物，我们尊重自己。

Living in respect ensures that we are living in a higher frequency than that into which we incarnated.  

生活在尊重中确保我们生活在一个比我们投生的更高的频率。

When we recognize that we are all one with our fellow incarnates and with our Creator, our Source Entity,our God,then we should also realize that we are one with the rest of our Source's creations. This includes the multiverse,the physical universe,the galaxies and planets,the nebulae and stars,the earth,and its flora and fauna. In recognizing this,we will naturally respect everything in accord with how we treat ourselves-with respect,with kindness,with love,with wisdom and with oneness. 

当我们认识到我们都是与我们的同胞和我们的造物主，我们的源实体，我们的上帝一体时，我们也应该认识到我们是与我们源头的其他创造物一体的。这包括多维宇宙，物质宇宙，银河系和行星，星云和恒星，地球，以及它的动植物。认识到这一点，我们将自然地尊重一切与我们如何对待自己一致——尊重，善良，爱，智慧和合一。

### Being a Good Spiritual Example 

**成为一个好的灵性榜样** 

When we ignore the needs of our siblings or children in terms of providing love,care, and wisdom,it is similar to ignoring our "self. "Moreover,in terms of providing a spiritual education when our children or younger siblings are at their most impressionable,if we ignore them,it is tantamount to actively"denying"them the opportunity to receive a chance to better themselves early in their incarnation. They may then drift into "habits"within the material world that result in the accumulation of lower frequency existence.  

当我们忽视了我们的兄弟姐妹或孩子在提供爱、关心和智慧方面的需要时，这类似于忽视了我们的“自我”。此外，当我们的孩子或弟弟妹妹处于他们最易受影响的时期，如果我们忽视了他们，就等于主动“否认”了他们在他们投生之初获得改善自己的机会。他们可能会在物质世界里陷入“习惯”，导致低频率存在的积累。

We must not force such teachings but rather teach by example. A child that is surrounded by individuals of "good"spiritual habits will naturally accrue these habits,allowing them to survive exposure to bad habits and maintain their good habits. However,a child surrounded by individuals with bad habits will generally not be affected by exposure to good habits because of the intoxicating effect of those lower frequency bad habits.  

我们不应该强迫这样的教导，而是以身作则。一个被具有“良好”精神习惯的人包围的孩子会自然地积累这些习惯，使他们能够在暴露于坏习惯中生存下来并保持他们的好习惯。然而，一个被具有坏习惯的人包围的孩子通常不会受到暴露于好习惯的影响，因为那些低频率的坏习惯的陶醉效果。

When we ignore opportunities to demonstrate to children how to live and exist in a high frequency manner in a material world,we deny them a much needed spiritual education.  This is a double-edged karmic sword. If we effectively expose them to intoxicating low frequencies or karma that results from our promotion of or non-correction of their bad habits,we also expose ourselves to lower frequency thought processes through not caring or loving them enough. Ultimately,we create karma for ourselves as well. 

当我们忽视了向孩子们展示如何在物质世界以高频率的方式生活和存在的机会时，我们否认了他们非常需要的精神教育。这是一把双刃的业力之剑。如果我们让他们沉迷于低频或者因我们对他们坏习惯的鼓励或不改正而产生的业力，我们也因为不够关心或爱他们而使自己陷入低频的思想过程，最终，我们也为自己创造了业力。

### Being True to Ourselves 

**忠于自己** 

Being true to ourselves should not be avoided,specifically when we are under external pressure to change.  

我们不应该避免忠于自己，特别是当我们处于外部压力而改变的时候。

When we are forced to be that which we are not in order to fit into another's paradigm,we are fulfilling the requirements of the other rather than ourselves. Serving the requirements of the self is just as important as serving the requirements of another,but not if it's to the detriment of the self.  

当我们被迫成为我们不是为了适应别人的范例，我们是满足别人的要求而不是我们自己的。服务于自我的需求是一样的重要的服务于他人的需求，但如果这是对自我的损害。

We must stay true to our own beliefs,ethos,plans and personality even when others try to make us into something that we are not. This will insure that we work with them from the highest level. When we work from the level of truth and integrity,we negate the opportunity for exposure to and participation in low frequency activities whilst also being of service. 

我们必须忠于自己的信仰，精神，计划和个性，即使别人试图让我们成为我们不是的东西。这将确保我们从最高层次与他们合作。当我们从真理和正直的层次上工作时，我们否定了接触和参与低频率活动的机会，同时还提供服务。

### Eradicating Self-Doubt 

**消除自我怀疑** 

Self-doubt is an important aspect of karma to recognize and is even more important for us to remove from our experiential vocabulary.  

自我怀疑是业力的一个重要方面，要认识到这一点，对我们来说更重要的是从我们的经验词汇中删除它。

Doubt is a function of our remaining in a low frequency existence,being in the physical,and having limiting thoughts. These limiting thoughts are programmed into us the moment we incarnate,ensuring we work within certain guidelines and rules that deny us our heritage and our remembrance that we are an aspect of the divine-incarnate.  

怀疑是我们留在低频率存在中的一个功能，存在于物质世界，有有限的想法。这些有限的想法在我们投生之时就被编程到我们身上，确保我们在某些指导方针和规则中工作，这些指导方针和规则否认我们的遗产和我们的记忆，我们是神圣化身的一部分。

As an incarnate aspect of the divine,we are unlimited in this respect and when we recognize this fact,self-doubt dissolves and is unknown. 

作为神圣化身的一部分，我们在这方面是无限的，当我们认识到这个事实时，自我怀疑就会消失，变得无从知晓。

### Limiting Thoughts 

**限制性思维**

Limiting thoughts are a function of self-doubt,low self-esteem and a "frustrated"low frequency existence. The frustration is a function of the underlying knowledge that we can and should be capable of a higher level of existence. The limitations to our thoughts can be a product of our inability to think at a level above that which we are currently experiencing It may also be the result of our being immersed in the low frequency thoughts surrounding others of a low frequency existence that we may "naturally"gravitate toward in order to create a feeling of oneness or togetherness.  

局限性的想法是自我怀疑、低自尊和“沮丧”低频率的存在。沮丧是一种潜在的知识的功能，我们可以，应该能够一个更高层次的存在。我们的思想的局限性可能是我们无法思考在我们目前正在经历的水平以上的一个产品。 它也可能是我们沉浸在低频率的想法周围的低频率存在的结果，我们可能会“自然”地被吸引到为了创造一种统一或在一起的感觉。

Instead,it is essential that we surround ourselves with those people who are always pushing the boundaries of their experiences through unlimited spiritually aware thoughts. Doing so will and does result in our creating higher thoughts of unlimited content and thus raising our frequencies. 

相反，我们周围的人是至关重要的，他们总是通过无限的精神意识想法来推动他们的经验的边界。这样做将导致我们创造无限内容的更高的思想，从而提高我们的频率。

### Attracting Lower Frequencies Through Jealousy 

**嫉妒吸引低频**

Jealousy is a rather invisible method of attracting the lower frequencies as it acts in several ways: 

嫉妒是一种相当隐蔽的吸引低频的方法，因为它以几种方式起作用：

- Firstly,we can be jealous about what another "owns. "When we desire the possession of others,we create an association with the physical.  
- Secondly,we can be jealous about what someone has "made"of himself in this physical existence. When we do this,we create a link to the lower frequencies in an indirect method by desiring to be that which someone "is. " 
- Thirdly,both of these jealousy-based methods of attracting lower frequencies are augmented by the inevitable self-generated competition we have with those who have that which we desire. 

- 首先，我们可以嫉妒别人“拥有”的东西。当我们渴望占有别人时，我们就创造了一个与物质的联系。
- 其次，我们可以嫉妒别人在这个物质存在中“成就”了什么。当我们这样做时，我们就通过渴望成为别人“是”的那种人，以间接的方式创造了一个与低频的联系。
- 第三，这两种基于嫉妒的吸引低频的方法，都被我们与那些拥有我们所渴望的东西的人不可避免的自我产生的竞争所增强。

### Maintaining a Healthy Physical Body 

**保持健康的身体**

It's imperative that we look after our physical bodies. We must keep them well-exercised, well-nourished,well-hydrated and well-rested-both mentally and physically.  

我们必须照顾好自己的身体。我们必须让他们得到充分的锻炼，营养充足，水分充足，休息充足——精神上和身体上都如此。

Although attractions to the lower frequencies of the physical are normally attributed to the actions resulting from dysfunctional thought processes that cause the addictions and habits that anchor us to these low frequencies,a poorly maintained physical vehicle can act as an attraction with equal effectiveness. This is due to the mental focus we have on the aches and pains,tiredness,slowness,and a lack of power if we are overweight and unfit. Ultimately,this results in mental and physical lethargy and a feeling of "giving up"because it's TOO HARD TO CHANGE! 

虽然对身体低频的吸引通常归因于功能失调的思维过程导致的上瘾和习惯，这些上瘾和习惯将我们锚定在这些低频上，但一辆保养不善的汽车也可以起到同样的作用。这是由于我们的精神集中在疼痛、疲劳、缓慢，以及如果我们超重和不健康时缺乏动力。最终，这会导致精神和身体的倦怠，以及一种“放弃”的感觉，因为改变太难了！

Like attracts like,and if we are in the doldrums of the lower frequencies of the physical,then we will attract similar energies and the people associated with them.  

爱会吸引爱，如果我们处于身体低频的低潮中，那么我们会吸引类似的能量和与之相关的人。

And so it is that we must look after our bodies and stay bright and healthy as a result-thus, we create positive "high frequency"thought processes.  When we attract positive thoughts and high frequency responses,we will attract individuals of "like-minded thoughts. "In turn,we will boost our frequencies,sever any attachments to low frequency functionality,and avoid karma. 

因此，我们必须照顾好自己的身体，保持明亮和健康——因此，我们创造积极的“高频”思维过程。当我们吸引积极的想法和高频反应时，我们会吸引“志同道合”的人。反过来，我们会提升我们的频率，切断任何与低频功能的联系，避免业力。

### Walking Our "Good Living"Talk 

**践行我们自己的“美好生活”**

When we put into practice the theory of good living,we avoid negative karma. Thus,we can enjoy the reality of living this way,for we are breaking the karmic cycle. 

当我们实践善行理论时，我们避免了负面业力，因此，我们可以享受这种生活的现实，因为我们打破了业力轮回。

### Examining Oneness 

**检视真正的“合一”**

Since all are one,we are reminded of that oneness when we associate with like-minded individuals who are working together in "metaconcert"for a single focused cause for the good of all. An example of doing this is a group meditation that focuses on sending love and light and remembrance to all that is as opposed to a group meditation focused on potential individualized gain.  

因为一切都是一体，当我们与志同道合的个人联系在一起时，我们会想起那种合一，他们在“超能共鸣”中为所有人的利益而共同努力。这样做的例子是，一个团体冥想，专注于向所有人发送爱、光和记忆，而不是专注于潜在的个人利益的团体冥想。

False oneness is achieved via association of like-minded individuals working together to be part of the crowd in order to not be left out. This is oneness for the ultimate benefit of self and is a function of being in the physical. 

虚假的合一是通过志同道合的个人的联系来实现的，他们一起努力成为人群的一部分，以免被排除在外。这是自我最终利益的合一，是存在于物质世界的功能。

### Being Beholden to Another 

**蒙恩于他人** 

Another way for us to avoid attaining karma is to avoid being "in beholden"to another in any way,shape,or form offered outside of "service. "This could take the form of finances, favors,assistance,or direction.  

我们避免业力的另一种方式是避免以任何方式、形式或形式在“服务”之外“蒙恩”他人。这可以采取财政、恩惠、援助或指导的形式。

When we are held "in beholden"to someone who gives us help outside of "service,"that individual/"helper"gains control over us,the receivers of the help. Thus that person is able to hold us in ransom until we render a "certain"and usually "unknown"level of help in return.  

当我们“蒙恩”于在“服务”之外给我们帮助的人时，那个人/“帮助者”获得了对我们(帮助的接受者)的控制。因此，那个人能够控制我们，直到我们提供“某种”和通常“未知”的程度的帮助作为回报。

The most difficult type of help to repay that is given outside of "service"is "favor"or "assistance"that leads to or provides significant benefit to us as recipients. This can result in our being"in beholden"to that individual for the rest of our incarnate existence with our repeatedly receiving reminders of the level of help given us in the past. In this way we are kept under control and in misery.  

最难回报的“服务”之外的帮助是“恩惠”或“援助”，导致或为作为接受者的我们提供重大利益。这可能导致我们在我们余下的轮回生活中“蒙恩”于那个人，我们不断地收到过去给予我们的帮助程度的提醒。这样，我们被控制在痛苦之中。

Thus,the only way we should give help is in "service"and receive help when the helper is providing us help under the pretext of being in service to us. This ensures that we are not"in beholden"to the helper,nor is the helper "in beholding"to us. Both are free to exist without the need to "give"in return. 

因此，我们应该给予帮助的唯一方式是在“服务”中，当帮助者以为我们服务为借口提供帮助时，我们也接受帮助。这确保了我们没有“蒙恩”于帮助者，帮助者也没有“看重”我们。两者都可以自由地存在，而不需要“给予”回报。

### Creating Self-Generated Karma 

**创造“自生业力”** 

The ego is our "on-board"method of creating self-generated karma. We must beware of the ego and avoid its ways of creating karma while we are working within the physical environment. This includes working with those who are also incarnate.  

自我是我们创造自我产生的业力的“上船”方法。当我们在物质环境中工作时，我们必须小心自我，避免它创造业力的方式。这包括与那些也转世投胎的人一起工作。

Our ego was created during our incarnation process and is a transient condition that dissolves when this incarnation ends. As such,our ego does its best to perpetuate its own existence in ignorance of the fact that it cannot ultimately curtail its inevitable demise. In its ignorance,however,it perpetuates itself by luring us into a false sense of innocence that makes us negate its existence by attracting us to materialistic thoughts,actions and habits that make us "feel good"about our "self"through falsehoods. We must be vigilant and notice the conditions that make us "feel good"so we are not misled by the ego.  Some of these are position,status,appearance,belongings,influence and credibility with others. Clearly we generate some of these through "good living"as well whilst also being aware of karma;however,this can only be achieved if they are generated outside of ego's influence and are received in humility. 

我们的自我是在我们的转世过程中创造的，是一个短暂的条件，当这个转世结束时就会消失。因此，我们的自我尽其所能地延续自己的存在，却忽视了它最终无法阻止其不可避免的灭亡这一事实。然而，在它的无知中，它通过诱惑我们进入一种虚假的无辜感来延续自己，这种无辜感使我们通过吸引我们到物质主义的思想、行为和习惯来否定它的存在，使我们通过谎言对我们的“自我”感到“感觉良好”。我们必须警惕并注意使我们“感觉良好”的条件，以免被自我误导。其中一些是职位、地位、外表、财产、影响力和与他人的信誉。显然，我们通过“美好的生活”也产生了一些，同时还意识到业力；然而，这只能在它们不受自我影响的情况下产生，并在谦卑中获得。

### Being in Fear 

**活在恐惧中** 

Without doubt,fear is a low frequency emotion. We can be in fear of something without even recognizing it as fear or,indeed,a low frequency emotion per se. While incarnate,we often focus on that associated with our physical existence rather than remembering that we are very high frequency energetic entities momentarily incarnating in physical forms for evolutionary purposes.  

毫无疑问，恐惧是一种低频率的情感。我们可以对某事感到恐惧，而甚至没有意识到它是一种恐惧，或者，事实上，它本身是一种低频率的情感。在投生时，我们经常专注于与我们的物质存在相关的事情，而不是记住我们是高频率的能量实体，为了进化的目的暂时投生到物质形态中。

As we become absorbed by fear,we are attracted to the lower frequencies by default. As such,our evolutionary progression is held back until we recognize and are able to resolve our attachment to fear and its low frequency energy. We can only achieve this by dedicated meditation on attaining full and direct communion with our Creator. This will lead us to recognition of our divinity,oneness with our Creator,and subsequent infinite longevity or immortality as an individualized unit of our Creator God. 

当我们被恐惧所吸引时，我们默认地被吸引到较低的频率。因此，我们的进化进程被阻碍了，直到我们认识到并能够解决我们对恐惧及其低频率能量的依恋。我们只能通过专注于冥想来实现与我们的造物主充分和直接的沟通。这将引导我们认识到我们的神性，与我们的造物主的合一，以及随后作为造物主上帝的一个个性化的单位的无限长寿或不朽。

### Generating Karma Due to Boredom 

**“无聊”产生的业力**

From an evolutionary perspective when we create self-generated karma,it is like shooting ourselves in the foot. Self-generated karma,in essence,encompasses everything that is identified in this guide. Much of our karmic debt is a result of being "drawn into"various different situations by others,such as gossip,blame,crime,etc. ;however,we can also create karma whilst totally isolated,both in location and in interactions with others.  

从进化论的角度来看，当我们创造自我产生的业力时，就像是在自己脚下开枪。自我产生的业力，本质上，涵盖了本指南中所确定的一切。我们的许多业债是由于被他人“拉入”各种不同的情境，如八卦、指责、犯罪等； 然而，我们也可以在完全孤立的情况下创造业力，无论是在位置上还是在与他人的互动中。

Self-generated karma is,therefore,created by the attraction to and intoxication of low frequency thoughts,activities and habits. This happens when we are in a state of boredom and is created by the ego's need to maintain control of the so-called "conscious self. "In this instance,the antidote is for us to use the time available (free time that results in boredom) to meditate on "just being"or contacting our Creator God,thereby using spare time in a most productive way. 

因此，自我产生的业力是由低频思想、活动和习惯的吸引和陶醉所创造的。当我们处于一种无聊的状态时，就会发生这种情况，这是由自我维持对所谓的“有意识的自我”控制的需求所创造的。在这种情况下，对我们来说，解药是我们使用可用的时间(导致无聊的空闲时间)来冥想“只是存在”或与我们的造物主上帝联系，从而以最富有成效的方式利用空闲时间。

### Avoiding Coercion 

**避免胁迫** 

Coercion is generated by persuading others to do our bidding rather than doing things ourselves. It is a practice we must shun at all costs if we are to avoid karma. Whereas persuasion is based upon our presentation of compelling evidence to encourage individuals to change the direction of their thought processes,coercion is insidious because it is brought into play to support the demands of the coercer through devious means,like threats to an individual's business or social position,family,and/or person or is favor-based.  

强制是通过说服别人去做我们的命令而不是自己做事情。如果我们要避免业力，我们必须不惜一切代价避免这种做法。然而，劝说是基于我们提出的令人信服的证据，鼓励个人改变他们的思维过程的方向，强制是阴险的，因为它是通过不正当的手段来支持强制者的要求，比如威胁一个人的生意或社会地位，家庭，和/或个人或以帮助为基础。

To avoid karma resulting from the use of coercion,we must observe the methods we use to negotiate when negotiation is required. We must ensure that we employ only pure thoughts and true evidence in the negotiation process and not personality-and/or position-based persuasion or coercion.  

为了避免因使用强制而导致的业力，当需要谈判时，我们必须观察我们用来谈判的方法。我们必须确保我们在谈判过程中只使用纯粹的想法和真实的证据，而不是基于个性和/或地位的劝说或强制。

If someone requests or we see that someone needs a favor,we should freely give it "in service"and not as a means of coercion. 

如果有人要求或我们看到有人需要帮助，我们应该自愿地“在服务中”给予，而不是作为一种强制手段。

### Apportioning Blame on Others 

**归咎于人** 

If we apportion blame on another as a disguise for our shortcomings,we are disowning our actions and the results of those actions. Moreover,if we accept the accolades of success in tandem with apportioning blame to others,whether or not they are responsible,we are taking advantage of them in a most blatant and profiteering way. Thus,if we select so-called desired outcomes and discard undesired outcomes and then apportion the results of undesired outcomes upon those who may not be able to defend themselves,we are acting in a most irresponsible manner. In so doing,we are missing an opportunity for learning from that experience and evolving.  

如果我们把责任推卸给别人来掩饰我们的缺点，我们就是在否认我们的行为和这些行为的结果。此外，如果我们接受成功的荣誉的同时又把责任推卸给别人，不管他们是否对此负责，我们就是在以最明目张胆和牟利的方式利用他们。因此，如果我们选择所谓的期望结果，抛弃不期望的结果，然后把不期望的结果的结果推卸给那些可能无法保护自己的人，我们就是在以最不负责任的方式行事。这样做，我们错失了一个从经验中学习和进化的机会。

Apportioning blame is a double edged sword,for it not only adds karma but also negates the opportunity for evolutionary progression. 

责怪是一把双刃剑，因为它不仅增加了业力，而且否定了进化进步的机会。

### Using Others for Self-Gain 

**利用他人牟取私利**

To use others for self-gain,a form of coercion,is a particularly effective way to accrue karma.  It can be addictive,specifically if we are successful in the use of a particular individual and easily gain that which we desire. Through using others for self-gain,low frequency behavior is perpetuated and augmented as more and more success is achieved. Indeed,as an individual gains confidence in using others for self-gain,the use of others increases accordingly. Unfortunately so does the attraction to low frequency behavior. Additionally, because the level of confidence derived through expected success and improved coercive skill increases,there is further temptation to "use"others to the point of its becoming normal behavior for that individual.  

为了个人利益而利用他人，是一种强制性行为，是一种特别有效的积累业力的方式。它可以让人上瘾，特别是当我们成功地利用某个特定的人并轻易地获得我们所渴望的东西时。通过利用他人来获取个人利益，低频率行为会随着越来越多的成功而得以延续和增强。事实上，当一个人在利用他人来获取个人利益方面获得信心时，对他人的利用也会相应地增加。不幸的是，低频率行为的吸引力也会随之增加。此外，由于通过预期的成功和提高强制性技巧而获得的信心水平会增加，“利用”他人的诱惑会进一步增强，直到它成为该个人的正常行为。

The antidote is wonderfully simple in this instance. It is applied by doing ourselves that which we would use others to do. Thus,we achieve that which we gain through "our own hard work"and can justify the pleasures,satisfaction,and accolades bestowed upon us,for we will have not received them off the backs of others. 

在这种情况下，解药非常简单。我们会让别人做的事情，我们自己也应该去做。这样，我们就能通过“我们自己的努力”来实现我们所获得的，并能证明我们所获得的快乐、满足和嘉奖是合理的，因为我们不会从别人的背上得到它们。

### Committing Crime 

**犯罪**  

Crime of any sort creates karma. If we know what is right and what is wrong according to the law and choose to do wrong,we have created karma.  

任何种类的犯罪都会创造业力。如果我们知道根据法律什么是对什么是错，但却选择去做错事，我们就创造了业力。

Although it is recognized in many spiritual circles that there is no right or wrong,no positive or negative,and that there is only experience,it is a very wise incarnate that knows that there are certain paths that we must take in order to maximize evolutionary opportunities whilst within the lower frequencies of the universe,the Earth plane. As incarnate entities, we must recognize that there is a need to reduce the number of incarnations necessary for us to ascend beyond the need for incarnation-based evolution.  

尽管在许多灵界中都承认没有对或错，没有积极或消极，只有经验，但一个非常明智的化身知道，在宇宙的低频率，地球层级内，为了最大化进化机会，我们必须采取某些特定的路径。作为化身实体，我们必须认识到，为了超越基于化身的进化需求，我们必须减少必要的化身数量。

Committing a crime in this instance is not only an effective way of creating karma,it is also an effective way to reduce and even stop our evolutionary growth. Stopping or reducing our evolutionary growth opportunities is,therefore,a crime in itself-one that perpetuates karma. 

在这种情况下犯下罪行，不仅是一种创造业力的有效方式，它也是减少甚至停止我们进化成长的有效方式。因此，停止或减少我们的进化成长机会本身就是一种罪行——一种使业力永久化的存在。

### Causing Physical Harm 

**造成身体伤害** 

Knowingly and deliberately doing physical harm to our "human"incarnate vehicle is defiling the very temple that we reside within-even though our residence is on a temporary basis.  

有意识地、故意地对我们的“人类”化身工具进行物理伤害，就是玷污我们居住的神庙——即使我们的居住是暂时的。

Knowingly and deliberately doing physical harm to another's "human"incarnate vehicle is not the behavior of an evolved individual and invokes tremendous karma and low frequency attachment,especially when the act of "doing harm"brings pleasure.  

有意识地、故意地对他人的“人类”化身工具进行物理伤害，不是进化个体的行为，会引发巨大的业力和低频连线，特别是当“伤害”行为带来快乐时。

Clearly we can and do have accidents when embarking upon experiential work as incarnates,and this is accepted. It is accepted because it is the "experiential content,"the learning and subsequent evolutionary aspect of experience that results from accidental damage of our human vehicle,for this is ultimately part of our life plan.  

很明显，当我们作为化身开始体验工作时，我们可以而且确实会有意外，这是可以接受的。这是可以接受的，因为这是“体验内容”，学习和随后的进化方面的体验，这些体验来自我们人类工具的意外伤害，因为这最终是我们生命计划的一部分。

Deliberately damaging the incarnate vehicle in some way to perpetuate its existence in general,such as with amputation,surgery,etc. ,is acceptable though. This is because the reasons for such actions are understood and recognized as part of the plan.  

然而，以某种方式故意破坏化身工具以使其普遍存在，例如截肢、手术等，是可以接受的。这是因为这些行为的原因是被理解和认识为计划的一部分。

The antidote in all instances is to respect,maintain and nurture the human vehicle and recognize its true worth,importance and longevity. In this way we also respect the "vehicles"of others whilst also recognizing the necessity for the evolutionary growth of the incumbent spirits. 

在所有情况下，解毒剂是尊重、维护和培育人类工具，并认识到其真正的价值、重要性和寿命。这样，我们也尊重其他人的“工具”，同时认识到在职精神进化发展的必要性。

### Harming an Animal Body 

**伤害动物** 

As with the incarnate human vehicle,knowingly and deliberately doing physical harm to an "animal"incarnate vehicle is not the behavior of an evolved "incarnate"individual and invokes tremendous karma and low frequency attachment. This is especially true when the act of doing harm brings pleasure.  

与化身人类载体一样，有意识和故意地对“动物”化身载体造成身体伤害，不是进化“化身”个体的行为，并唤起巨大的业力和低频连线。当伤害行为带来快乐时，尤其如此。

We should recognize that spirits that incarnate as animals are very special gifts to us at this level of frequency,for they provide much needed unconditional love and company.  

我们应该认识到，在这个频率水平上，化身为动物的灵魂对我们来说是非常特殊的礼物，因为它们提供了非常需要的无条件的爱和陪伴。

Although not the same energetically as those who incarnate in the human vehicle,animal spirits are also on the evolutionary ladder and respond positively in this respect from human love,care,and happiness. They are also individualized units of our Source Entity,our God.  

尽管与那些在人类载体中化身的灵魂在能量上不相同，但动物灵魂也在进化阶梯上，并从人类的爱、关心和幸福方面做出积极的回应。它们也是我们源头实体的个性化单位，我们的上帝。

In many cases animal spirits take on heavy burdens for us in our daily striving for survival in the physical universe,including being an essential component of the ecosphere. As such,the animal incarnate vehicle must be respected and maintained in the same fashion as we look after our own human incarnate vehicles.  

在许多情况下，动物灵魂在我们每天在物质宇宙中为生存而奋斗的过程中，为我们承担了沉重的负担，包括成为生态圈的基本组成部分。因此，动物化身载体必须得到尊重和维护，就像我们照顾自己的人类化身载体一样。

We invoke the antidote to accruing low frequency energy when we recognize the true nature of animals as being "one with God"and,therefore,created in equality with our energetic selves. In essence,however,they have a higher level of purity when incarnate,for they are fully aware of the fact that they in most cases are dependent upon incarnate mankind's good will for their evolutionary progress. This level of purity is something incarnate mankind should aspire to. 

当我们认识到动物的真正本性是“与上帝合一”，因此，与我们充满活力的自我平等创造时，我们就调用积累低频能量的解毒剂。然而，本质上，当他们化身时，他们拥有更高层次的纯净，因为他们完全意识到，在大多数情况下，他们依赖于化身人类的善意来推动他们的进化进程。这种纯净的层次是化身人类应该渴望的。

### Harming Flora 

**伤害植物** 

Knowingly and deliberately doing physical harm to a tree,plant or vegetable is an act of violence against an aspect of our physical environment,nature,and,therefore,our Creator, The Source Entity. Committing flora-related violence,therefore,creates flora-related karma.  

有意识地故意对一棵树、植物或蔬菜造成身体伤害，是对我们物质环境、自然界，以及我们的造物主、源头实体的一种暴力行为。因此，犯下与植物群落相关的暴力行为，就会创造与植物群落相关的业力。

Although perceived by incarnate humanity as a lower life form,the kingdom of flora is extremely important from both a gross physical and energetic perspective to the perpetuation of the environment that supports the human physical form.  

尽管被化身人类视为一种较低的生命形式，但从总体的物质和能量角度来看，植物王国对维持支持人类物质形态的环境极为重要。

Clearly we have the authority to use nature to feed,clothe and house us,and this is accepted as essential for our well-being. We incur flora-related karma when we abuse this authority for personal or corporate greed or misdirected desire and destroy or fail to maintain those aspects of nature that are available to help us perpetuate our incarnate vehicles.  

显然，我们有权使用自然来为我们提供食物、衣服和住房，这被认为是我们幸福的必要条件。当我们为了个人或集体的贪婪或错误的欲望而滥用这种权力，破坏或未能维护那些可以帮助我们延续化身工具的大自然方面时，我们就会招致与植物群落相关的业力。

It is just as important to clear flora-related karma as normally accrued karma because both are functions of low frequency actions.  

清除与植物群落相关的业力与清除通常积累的业力一样重要，因为两者都是低频率行为的功能。

The antidote in this instance is to be "in joy"of that flora which surrounds us. We must nurture it,tend to its needs,and maintain it whilst recognizing how we can maximize nature's potential for evolution,for it can and does evolve as we live in harmony with it. 

在这种情况下，解毒剂就是“在我们周围的植物群落中快乐”。我们必须培养它，满足它的需要，维护它，同时认识到我们如何才能最大限度地发挥自然进化的潜力，因为当我们与自然和谐相处时，它可以而且确实在进化。

### Wasting Natural Resources

**浪费自然资源** 

The minerals that we use to create metals,ceramics,fuels and other materials are a gift to us from the earth. The earth in its sentience recognizes that our incarnate "human"vehicles are the tools we use for accelerating our evolution,and,as such,it supports that which we do with its minerals provided we use them for a high frequency existence that results in an increase in evolutionary content.  

我们用来制造金属、陶瓷、燃料和其他材料的矿物是地球给我们的礼物。地球在它的感知中认识到我们化身的“人类”工具是我们用来加速进化的工具，因此，它支持我们用它的矿物所做的，只要我们把它们用于高频的存在，从而导致进化内容的增加。

When we abuse this gift through inappropriate mining,extraction and refinement techniques due to personal and corporate greed,the earth suffers as a result,and we gain“earth-based"karma.  

当我们由于个人和集体的贪婪而通过不适当的采矿、提取和提炼技术滥用这份礼物时，地球就会因此遭受痛苦，而我们就会获得“基于地球的”业力。

Inappropriate mineral extraction causes an imbalance in the ecosphere that affects the stability of the earth's crust as well as its magnetic properties,atmosphere,and weather systems. This creates further imbalance and ultimately adversely affects incarnate mankind's ability to work with the earth and attract evolutionary content.  When we realize that the earth is our benefactor and work with her in a high frequency harmonious way,we help maximize Earth's evolutionary content and as a result,negate karmic links with the earth. 

不适当的矿物提取会导致生态圈的不平衡，影响地壳的稳定性以及它的磁性、大气和天气系统。这会造成进一步的不平衡，并最终对化身人类与地球合作和吸引进化内容的能力产生不利影响。当我们意识到地球是我们的恩人，并以高频率和谐的方式与她合作时，我们就帮助最大化地球的进化内容，因此，消灭了与地球的业力联系。

### Making Comparisons 

**执着于比较** 

When we make comparisons of any sort,it breeds discontent within us that breeds further comparison that leads to minor depression. Minor depression is fueled by comparison-generated discontent which creates a descending spiral-based loop that leads to major depression. Such a downward spiral is extremely difficult for us to recognize within ourselves and is even more difficult to reverse.  

当我们进行任何形式的比较时，它在我们内心滋生不满，滋生进一步的比较，导致轻度抑郁。轻度抑郁是由比较产生的不满所加剧的，它创造了一个下降的螺旋环，导致重度抑郁。这种向下的螺旋对于我们来说是非常难以识别的，甚至更难逆转。

However,comparison can also be used as an antidote or can even negate the potential start of this condition if we use it properly and with observational care. If done correctly, comparing where we are in lieu of where we were can provide a spiritual function.  Therefore,by observing what we have personally attained and thus comparing ourselves with ourselves,we can create a level of contentment and happiness.  

然而，如果我们正确地使用它，并以观察的谨慎，比较也可以被用作一种解毒剂，甚至可以否定这种情况的潜在开始。如果做得正确，比较我们在哪里，而不是我们在哪里可以提供一种精神功能。因此，通过观察我们个人所取得的成就，从而与我们自己比较，我们可以创造一种满足和幸福的水平。

When we are happy and content with what we have achieved,it brings a warm glow to us that illuminates the darkness and raises our frequencies as a result. Thus,it creates an ascending spiral-based loop that results in enlightened function and repeated frequential ascension. 

当我们对我们所取得的成就感到快乐和满足时，它给我们带来了温暖的光芒，照亮了黑暗，提高了我们的频率。因此，它创造了一个上升的螺旋环，导致启蒙功能和重复频率提升。

### Complaining:a Low Frequency Intoxication 

**抱怨，一种低频中毒症状** 

Complaining about our position,status,situation,lack of ability,lack of help,health,or even that we feel we have been given a raw deal in some way is a function of low frequency intoxication.  

抱怨我们的职位、地位、处境、缺乏能力、缺乏帮助、健康，甚至我们觉得我们被以某种方式对待是不公平的，这是低频中毒的功能。

Low frequency intoxication is a karmic function that results in our being so engrossed with physical existence that we forget that we are here to experience,learn and evolve. It makes us forget that this existence is an illusion,a VERY temporary illusion at best. 

低频中毒是一种业力功能，导致我们如此专注于物质存在，以至于我们忘记了我们在这里是为了体验、学习和进化。它让我们忘记了这个存在是一种幻觉，充其量是一种非常短暂的幻觉。

We are "incarnate"here to experience low frequency thoughts and/or feelings and learn to be victorious over them and thus evolve in the process.  

我们“化身”在这里是为了体验低频的想法和/或感觉，并学会战胜它们，从而在这个过程中进化。

When we can adopt the very useful tool of the "observer self,"we can identify the early occurrence of such thoughts and recognize them for what they are-signs of low frequency intoxication. When we recognize this,then we will be able to succeed in the face of low frequency adversity. 

当我们能够采用“观察者自我”这个非常有用的工具时，我们可以识别这种想法的早期发生，并认识到它们是什么——低频中毒的迹象。当我们认识到这一点时，我们就能够在低频逆境中取得成功。

### Needing to Be in Control 

**对“掌控”的需要** 

Being "in control"is like colluding with a false friend. Although control is useful in situations that require us to control ourselves and others,such as in emergencies or situations of crisis,it is detrimental outside those contexts. Control is detrimental when we apply it inappropriately to ourselves and/or a third party.  

处于“控制”中就像与一个虚伪的朋友勾结。尽管在需要我们控制自己和他人的情况下，控制是有用的，比如在紧急情况或危机的情况下，但在这些情境之外，控制是有害的。当我们不适当地将它应用于自己和/或第三方时，控制是有害的。

When we apply unnecessary control to ourselves during our everyday existence,we run the risk of missing those spontaneous responses required to support "out of the blue" opportunities for us to experience something new. These types of opportunities are usually examples of circumstances given to us by our spiritual guide/s and helpers because we either need to change or need a change. This is called "going with the flow,"which cannot happen if we are too self-controlled or always need to be "in control. "In this instance,our being in self-control limits our abilities to access higher frequency information and keeps us in the lower frequencies,which is a function of karma.  

当我们在日常生活中对自己施加不必要的控制时，我们冒着失去那些自发反应的风险，这些自发反应是支持我们体验新事物的“意外”机会所必需的。这些类型的机会通常是我们的精神导师和帮助者给我们的环境的例子，因为我们要么需要改变，要么需要改变。这被称为“随波逐流”，如果我们过于自我控制或总是需要“控制”，这将不会发生。在这种情况下，我们的自我控制限制了我们获取更高频率信息的能力，并使我们处于较低的频率，这是业力的功能。

When we are in control of others (third parties),we are tempted to use those under our control for the benefit of ourselves and not for their benefit. Even though we feel justified or even delighted or joyful being in control,the feeling of justification/joy in this instance is that aspect of control that tells us it is a false friend-for we should not be joyful or able to justify being in control of others. 

当我们控制他人(第三方)时，我们试图利用那些在我们控制之下的人来为自己谋利，而不是为他们谋利。即使我们感到理所当然，甚至高兴或快乐的控制，在这种情况下，理由/快乐的感觉是控制的方面告诉我们，这是一个错误的朋友，因为我们不应该快乐或能够证明控制别人。

### Comparing and Contrasting 

**比较和对比** 

Contrast is a little known and mostly ignored function of comparison. When we compare and contrast our situations in relation to others'situations,we judge the differences and draw conclusions about the acceptability of these differences. We do this in the light of our newly acquired "standard"of a potentially better situation for us to be in even though it might not be.  ，

对比是比较中一个鲜为人知且常被忽略的功能。当我们比较和对比我们与他人处境的关系时，我们判断这些差异并得出关于这些差异可接受性的结论。我们这样做是基于我们新获得的潜在的更好的处境的“标准”，即使它可能不是。

If,however,we were to use contrast as a means of establishing where we can help others who are less able to provide for themselves,then we could turn this potential opportunity for accruing low frequency karma into an opportunity to gain high frequency karma and the relative evolutionary content. This is specifically pertinent when we are looking to use "contrast"as a means of establishing what we can provide to a group of individuals whose living conditions are poor in contrast to our own.  

然而，如果我们将使用对比作为一种建立我们可以帮助那些无法提供给自己的人的手段，那么我们就可以将这种积累低频业的机会转化为获得高频业和相关进化内容的机会。当我们希望使用“对比”作为一种建立我们可以为一群生活条件与我们自己的相比很差的人提供什么的手段时，这是特别相关的。

In this instance we are activating the evolutionary content aligned with our being of service instead of falling down the slippery frequential slope of dissatisfaction with our current situation in contrast to a higher standard-one which may or may not be appropriate. 

在这种情况下，我们正在激活与我们服务相一致的进化内容，而不是跌落到与更高标准相对的对我们当前处境不满的滑坡上，而这个更高标准可能合适，也可能不合适。

### Attracting Positive Karma via Joy 

**通过快乐吸引积极的业力** 

Experiencing joy in our incarnate life is touching the very nerve of high frequency existence.  

在我们的化身生活中体验快乐触动了高频率存在的神经。

When we "en-joy,"we are "in-joy. "When we are "in-joy,"we are in tune with all things and all things are in tune with us. This feeling is a sign that we are experiencing the high frequencies of spirit whilst incarnate.  

当我们“享受快乐”时，我们是“在快乐中”。当我们“在快乐中”时，我们与万物协调，万物与我们协调。这种感觉是当我们化身时体验到高频率精神的标志。

It is important for us to try to hold onto situations where we are "in-joy,"remember them, and then take them and that feeling with us wherever we go. We build upon them by adding other times and situations where we were "in-joy. "In this way,we create a complete picture of joy and what we enjoy.  

对我们来说，重要的是努力抓住我们“在快乐中”的情形，记住它们，然后把它们和那种感觉带到我们去的任何地方。我们通过添加我们“在快乐中”的其他时间和情形来建立它们。以这种方式，我们创造了快乐和我们喜欢的一幅完整的画面。

When we know and seek that which brings joy and are in a continuous state of joy,we automatically raise our base frequencies. Doing so allows us to experience new joy,ever new joy every time we are in joy.  

当我们知道和寻找什么带来快乐，并处于持续的快乐状态时，我们自动提高我们的基本频率。这样做让我们体验新的快乐，每次我们都体验新的快乐。

As we experience higher and ever higher frequencies,we negate the influence of lower frequencies,no matter how hard they try to bring us down. In this process we ascend from the influence of karma. In this way we become closer to our Creator and experience the ultimate joy of being one with God. 

当我们体验越来越高的频率时，我们否定了低频率的影响，无论它们如何努力地让我们倒下。在这个过程中，我们从业力的影响中提升。以这种方式，我们变得更接近我们的造物主，并体验到与上帝合一的终极快乐。

### Being Happy 

**保持开心** 

Happiness is a product of joy and is an visible example of a state of joyful existence,thinking and being.  

幸福是喜悦的产物，是喜悦存在、思考和存在的可见例子。

Personal happiness is the long term effect of being "in joy"and bridges the gaps between joyful experiences. The "joy-happiness-joy-happiness-joy"cycle is a profoundly efficient way of increasing our frequencies,especially when the experience ofjoy and the subsequent production of happiness is the result of spiritual activity.  

个人幸福是处于“喜悦”中的长期效果，并弥补了喜悦体验之间的差距。“喜悦-幸福-喜悦-幸福-喜悦”循环是提高我们频率的深刻有效方式，特别是当喜悦的体验和随后的幸福产生是精神活动的结果时。

In this way we can accelerate our evolutionary content whilst enjoying the process of gaining evolution and being happy with the outcome and lasting effects of such gains.  

这样，我们可以加快我们的进化内容，同时享受获得进化的过程，并对这种收获的结果和持久效果感到快乐。

In essence,when we have the "joy-happiness-joy-happiness-joy"cycle fully established,we are capable of ever new joy and ever new happiness without gaps or loss of associated frequency. As a result,we can and do increase our base frequencies and ascend in the process. 

本质上，当我们完全建立起“喜悦-幸福-喜悦-幸福-喜悦”循环时，我们能够获得新的喜悦和新的幸福，而不会有关联频率的间断或损失。因此，我们可以并确实增加了我们的基本频率，并在过程中提升。

### Being in True Love 

**怀抱真爱之心** 

Love is the true antidote for all karmic influences. When we are"in love,"we are in peace and harmony with everything and everyone. 

爱是所有业力影响的真正解药。当我们“坠入爱河”时，我们与一切事物和每个人都处于和平与和谐之中。

This is not love in the human sense but in the spiritual or energetic sense. Human love is based upon physical attraction whereas spiritual/energetic love is based upon an understanding and full appreciation of the interconnectedness of everything that "is." 

这不是人类意义上的爱，而是精神或能量意义上的爱。人类的爱基于身体吸引，而精神/能量的爱则基于对“存在”的一切事物的相互联系的理解和充分欣赏。

When we experience "true love,"we understand the underlying reasons for everything that happens around us. Everything that is done by everything and everyone has a purpose and a meaning. When this is recognized and understood as such,even so-called "wrong doing" is recognized as having a purpose. This purpose is our need to experience,learn from that experience,and subsequently gain evolutionary content.  

当我们体验“真爱”时，我们理解发生在我们周围的一切事情的潜在原因。一切事物和每个人所做的一切都有目的和意义。当这被认识到并被理解为如此时，即使所谓的“错误行为”也被认为是有目的的。这个目的是我们需要经历，从经验中学习，并随后获得进化的内容。

Being in "true love"then allows us to be in complete understanding of the process of incarnate existence. It allows us to see the beauty in everything and everyone,forgive wrong-doings even before they happen,and have no enemies. It is then that we realize all are fellow incarnates who are striving to evolve in the way we are with everything being in divine order.  

处于“真爱”中，我们可以完全理解化身存在的进程。它让我们看到一切事物和每个人身上的美，原谅甚至在发生之前就发生的错误行为，没有敌人。那时我们才意识到，所有的人都是同胞，他们都在努力以我们的方式进化，一切都遵循神圣的秩序。

When we are in "true love,"we bear no ill feelings,do nothing to attract low frequency thoughts,and help everything and everyone in all circumstances. In the process we do not incur karma. 

当我们处于“真爱”中时，我们不怀有恶念，不做任何吸引低频思想的事情，在任何情况下都帮助一切事物和每个人。在这个过程中我们不会招致业力。

### Committing Suicide 

**自杀行为** 

Suicide is a method of gaining massive instant karma. Karma accrued as a result of suicide is gained in two ways: 

自杀是一种获得大量即时业力的方法。自杀所累积的业力有两种方式：

Firstly,for terminally defiling the gift of the physical vehicle because these are in short supply in comparison with the huge number of energetic entities requesting incarnate existence;

首先，最终玷污了物质载体的礼物，因为与要求化身存在的大量能量实体相比，物质载体的供应不足；

Secondly,not as a result of the act of suicide but as a result of the association with the lower frequencies that resulted in the desire to commit the act of suicide.  

其次，不是自杀行为的结果，而是与低频率的关联导致了自杀行为的欲望。

In essence the first way of gaining suicide-based karma is a result of the second way. 

本质上，获得自杀业力的第一种方式是第二种方式的结果。

### Recognizing Instant Karma 

**觉察即时业力** 

If we create any kind of suffering for another person and then receive back that which we gave that person or if we receive it back from another person,this is an example of "instant karma"or“divine retribution. ”

如果我们为别人制造了任何一种痛苦，然后我们收到了我们给那个人的痛苦，或者我们从另一个人那里收到了痛苦，这就是“即时业力”或“神圣报应”的一个例子。

It can be helpful to receive instant karma for two reasons:(1)we are not tied to the karmic cycle as a result of the delivery of that which incurred the instant karma because we receive an equal action in return;and (2)we are able to learn from the mistake and correct it very quickly if we are observant enough to recognize the situation as a function of instant karma.  

收到即时业是有帮助的，有两个原因：(1)由于我们收到了同样的回报，因此我们不会因产生即时业而被束缚于业轮中；(2)如果我们足够善于观察，能够认识到这种情况是即时业的功能，我们能够从错误中学习，并很快改正它。

Instant karma,also classified as divine retribution,occurs when an additional function is being performed that is invisible to the person who caused someone to suffer (the dealer of the suffering to another),the person who suffered from the incident caused by another (second party "sufferer"),and the third party "dealer"who returns that suffering to the individual who was initially hurt. This function is the underlying ability of the third party to settle up previous and similar karma with the first party,which then clears that particular karmic link.  

即时业力，也被归类为神圣报应，当一个额外的功能正在执行时，就会发生，这个功能对造成别人痛苦的人(给别人带来痛苦的人)、从别人引起的事件中受苦的人(第二方“受苦者”)和将痛苦返回给最初受伤害的人的第三方“经销商”是无形的。这个功能是第三方与第一方结算以前和类似的业的基础能力，然后清除特定的业联系。

As with all that we do when incarnate,this relies on a significant level of logistics being performed behind the spiritual scenes with our guides and helpers working hard to assist us and those with whom we interface so we can experience,learn,evolve,and clear karma along the way. This is,indeed,a divine method of clearing karma. 

当我们投生时所做的一切，这依赖于在灵性场景背后的后勤工作，我们的向导和帮助者努力工作来协助我们和那些我们接触的人，这样我们就可以体验、学习、进化，并沿途清理业力。 这确实是一种神圣的清理业力的方法。

### Choosing Our Friends 

**选择朋友**

It is important for us to beware of false friends-those that steer us towards low frequency pleasures,such as physical sensations or any form of materialism or gossip,for they are only helping us gain an addiction to low frequency existence.  

对我们来说，重要的是要警惕虚假的朋友-那些引导我们走向低频率快乐的人，比如身体感觉或任何形式的物质主义或八卦，因为他们只是帮助我们获得对低频率存在的沉迷。

A true friend is one that works toward spiritual advancement and avoids anything that does not focus on that goal.  

一个真正的朋友是一个朝着精神进步而努力并避免任何不专注于这个目标的人。

A true friend is one that looks for the very simple pleasures in incarnate existence,those gained through correct living and meditation on the greater reality instead of the instant gratification that physicality offers and demands from others. 

一个真正的朋友是一个在化身的存在中寻找非常简单的快乐的人，那些通过正确的生活和冥想在更大的现实中获得的快乐，而不是身体提供和从他人那里要求的即时满足。

### Avoiding Attachment 

**避免依恋** 

Attachment in the human sense-that is,attachment to another person-is also a very effective way to remain in low frequency existence. In this instance,attachment is not love but the "need"to be near or within the "presence of"a certain individual or individual's physicality.  

人类意义上的依恋——即对另一个人的依恋——也是保持低频率存在的非常有效的方式。在这种情况下，依恋不是爱，而是靠近或在某个人或个人的身体“存在”的“需要”。

Attachment is,therefore,a form of materialism,but because it is relative to the need for "personal presence,"it is not easily recognized as such.  

因此，依恋是一种物质主义形式，但因为它与“个人存在”的需求有关，所以不容易被这样认识。

Attachment affects both the "initiator"of the attachment and the "focus"of the attachment as a result of an energetic link between the two. Keeping the "initiator"and "focus"linked to the frequencies associated with their physicality,which is a karmic function,retards the ability of both "initiator"and "focus"to ascend the frequencies,thus,creating a karmic cycle.  

由于两者之间的能量连接，依恋既影响了依恋的“发起者”又影响了依恋的“焦点”。保持“发起者”和“焦点”与与他们的身体相关的频率相连，这是一种业力功能，阻碍了“发起者”和“焦点”提升频率的能力，因此，创造了一个业力循环。

Clearly we create attachments to loved ones during our incarnation,but we should not hold onto them and remain attached when they are in the process of finishing their incarnations, for this holds both the "initiator"and the "focus"in the lower frequencies.  

很明显，我们在化身期间对所爱的人创造了依恋，但当他们在完成化身的过程中，我们不应该抓住他们并保持依恋，因为这将把“发起者”和“焦点”都保持在较低的频率中。

We plan our exit from the physical in the way that maximizes our experiential and subsequent evolutionary opportunity within a known incarnate timeframe. Unfortunately, this may not be to the liking of the one who has initiated or created the attachment. In this instance,we must accept that the exit method is pre-chosen and,therefore,respect and honor it. It is the time to send them true "non-attached"love,cognizant that in not having or actively removing attachment,we are helping them evolve and not holding them back in the lower frequencies of the physical. 

我们计划从物质层退出，以最大化我们的经验和随后在已知的化身时间框架内进化的机会。不幸的是，这可能不符合发起或创造了依附的人的喜好。在这种情况下，我们必须接受退出方法是预先选择的，因此，尊重和尊重它。是时候给他们真正的“无依恋”的爱，认识到在没有或积极地移除依附中，我们正在帮助他们进化，而不是把他们留在物质层的低频率中。

### Being in Divine Love 

**处于神圣的爱中** 

Infatuation is a significantly stronger form of attachment. It is to be totally engrossed in the physicality of another to the point of almost perfect distraction. In this situation,we ignore our need to service the activities that we are responsible for,specifically when we are in the physical presence of the focus of our infatuation.  

迷恋是一种明显更强烈的依恋形式。它完全专注于另一个人的身体，几乎完全分心。在这种情况下，我们忽略了我们需要为我们负责的活动服务的需求，特别是当我们身处我们迷恋的焦点的身体存在时。

Infatuation can be and often is disguised by love. When we feel that we are in love and not in infatuation,we are blind to its damaging effects. The only antidote in this instance is to first and foremost be in divine love and not human love;in doing so,we transcend the attraction to the physical condition and remove the opportunity for attracting karma.  

迷恋可以，而且经常被爱伪装。当我们感觉我们在爱中，而不是在迷恋中，我们对它的破坏性影响是盲目的。在这种情况下，唯一的解药是首先在神圣的爱中，而不是在人类的爱中； 这样做，我们超越了对身体条件的吸引，消除了吸引业力的机会。

Neither attachment nor infatuation can be sustained when we are in divine love,for when we are in divine love,we are in tune with all things,and all things are in tune with us. When we are in divine love,we realize the transient state of the physical with all its attractions and addictions and are,therefore,unaffected by such low frequency lures. 

当我们在神圣的爱中时，无论是依恋还是迷恋都不能持续，因为当我们在神圣的爱中时，我们与万物协调，万物与我们协调。当我们在神圣的爱中时，我们意识到身体的短暂状态以及它的所有吸引力和成瘾性，因此，我们不受这些低频诱惑的影响。

### Achieving Detachment 

**实现超然** 

Detachment can be both a help and a hindrance when it comes to low frequency attraction.  

当涉及到低频吸引时，分离既是一种帮助，也是一种阻碍。

If we detach ourselves from higher frequency existence as a result of some form of distraction that makes us think that the gross physical is "all there is,"then we become entrapped and succumb to the low frequency stimuli offered by the gross physical environment. This unfortunate process results in "reality blindness"as we focus on all forms of materialism.  

如果我们因为某种形式的分心而使我们认为粗糙的物质是“一切”，从而使我们从更高的频率存在中分离出来，那么我们就会陷入陷阱，屈服于粗糙的物质环境提供的低频刺激。当我们专注于各种形式的物质主义时，这一不幸的过程会导致“现实盲视”。

If we detach ourselves from the lower frequency distractions of the gross physical that occur on a regular basis,then we can maintain our high frequency existence whilst incarnate.  We grow as we experience these distractions,recognize them,learn from them,and act correctly. Subsequently,we evolve as a result of their transient effect. Though the effect is transient,it is beneficial in this instance because we recognize what it is,a function of low frequency existence. It is an opportunity for us as incarnate entities to recognize that which affects us. When we "see,feel and know"the reason for its existence and take the correct path,we negate its influence and turn it into positive karma that allows us to ascend in frequency as a result. 

如果我们把自己从常规发生的粗糙物质的低频分心中分离出来，那么我们就可以在化身时保持我们的高频存在。当我们经历这些分心时，我们成长，认识到它们，从中学习，并正确行事。随后，我们由于它们短暂的影响而进化。尽管这种影响是短暂的，但在这种情况下它是有益的，因为我们认识到它是什么，一个低频存在的功能。作为化身的实体，这是一个机会来认识到影响我们的是什么。当我们“看到、感觉到、知道”它存在的理由，并走上正确的道路，我们就否定了它的影响，并把它变成了正面的业力，结果让我们在频率上提升。

### Feeling Divine Love 

**感受神圣的爱** 

Divine love is all around us. It pervades the multiverse and is,therefore,part of our very being.  

神圣的爱围绕着我们。它遍布于多维宇宙，因此，它是我们存在的一部分。

However,if divine love pervades everything,then why is it not felt by everyone and everything all of the time?  The reason for our not being able to feel divine love is because we get engrossed in the day- to-day function of existence in the gross physical.  

然而，如果神圣的爱遍布一切，那么为什么每个人和每件事物都没有感受到它？ 我们无法感受到神圣的爱的原因是因为我们全神贯注于在粗糙的物质中存在的日常功能。

We are here to experience the minute details of incarnate life,but they are often such major distractions. If we are able to take a regular break from our day to day commitments and give time for meditation and appreciation of all that surrounds us,then we can link into the energies that are the basis of the gross physical universe and,therefore,the multiverse.  

我们在这里体验化身生活的细微细节，但它们往往是如此主要的干扰。如果我们能够从我们的日常承诺中抽出时间，给时间冥想和欣赏我们周围的一切，那么我们就可以连接到作为粗糙的物质宇宙的基础的能量，和多维宇宙。

These energies were used by the Source in the creation of the multiverse by giving up part of Itself. The Source is divine love and loves everyone and everything It created. We are one with the Source,and the Source is one with us. WE ARE THE SOURCE,and we are,therefore, in love,divine love,all of the time.  

这些能量被源头用于创造多维宇宙，通过放弃自己的一部分。源头是神圣的爱，爱它创造的每个人和每件事物。我们与源头是一体的，源头与我们是一体的。我们是源头，因此，我们一直处于爱中，神圣的爱中。

All we have to do is recognize this by opening our hearts during meditation and accepting everything that is. This will allow us to see past the physical,link in with everyone and everything,and recognize that we are all one-all one in divine love. 

我们所要做的就是在冥想中打开我们的心，接受一切。这将允许我们看穿物质，与每个人和每件事物连接，并认识到我们都是一体的——在神圣的爱中都是一体的。

### Aligning Ourselves with Divine Knowledge 

**校准吾身以对齐神圣知识**

When we align ourselves with divine or cosmic knowledge,we remove ourselves from the inaccuracies presented by the lower frequencies of the physical universe. When we are in alignment with the divine,we see through the facade of the physical,viewing it for what it is:a mode of experience designed to accelerate our evolution through hardships.  

当我们与神圣或宇宙知识保持一致时，我们从物理宇宙低频率所呈现的不准确中移除自己。当我们与神圣保持一致时，我们看穿了物质的表面，看到它是什么：一种经历模式，旨在通过艰辛加速我们的进化。

When we are aligned to divine knowledge,we can work with the challenges that are presented to us in the full awareness of that which we are experiencing and why we are experiencing it at a particular juncture in our incarnate existence. This allows us to make the best of situations and negates our need to experience the same thing through lack of learning the "lesson"the first time around.  

当我们与神圣知识保持一致时，我们可以与呈现给我们的挑战一起工作，我们对我们正在经历的事情以及我们为什么在我们化身存在的特定时刻经历它有充分的认识。这使我们能够充分利用情况，并否定我们需要通过第一次没有学习“课程”来经历同样的事情。

To become aligned with divine knowledge,we must be diligent in setting aside an un- negotiable time to meditate with an open heart and an empty mind. Doing so allows the greater reality of divine knowledge to overcome the transient "little reality"of personal knowledge we create whilst incarnate.  

为了与神圣知识保持一致，我们必须勤奋地留出一个不可谈判的时间来以开放的心和空虚的头脑冥想。这样做可以让神圣知识的更大现实来克服我们化身时创造的短暂的“小现实”。

We can only become aligned to the divine knowledge through dedication to knowing the truth and devotion to the ways necessary to allow us to open the door to the truth. It's a lifetime's work,but it's more than worth it. 

当我们与神圣知识保持一致时，我们看穿了物质的表面，看到它是什么：一种经历模式，旨在通过艰辛加速我们的进化。我们只有通过致力于了解真相，致力于让我们打开通往真相之门的必要方式，才能与神圣知识保持一致。这是一辈子的工作，但它非常值得。

### Accruing Retrospective Karma 

**累积回顾型业力**

Retrospective karma is based upon our being pulled back into discussions or arguments about that which occurred in the past or previous event spaces(times). When we are drawn into gossip about that which happened in the past,we are not only attracted to those low frequency existences based upon that event space but also those low frequency events that were in action in the previous event spaces leading up to the low frequencies. This results in a"total immersion-based"recollection of that experienced frequentially.  

回顾型业力是基于我们被拉回到过去或以前事件空间(时间)发生的讨论或争论中。当我们被拉进关于过去发生的八卦时，我们不仅被吸引到基于那个事件空间的那些低频存在，而且还被吸引到那些在以前事件空间中导致低频的低频事件。这导致了频繁经历的“完全沉浸式”回忆。

Thus,karma accrues in two ways:(1)that which we accrue currently;and (2)that which we accrue by living in the past-retrospectively.  

因此，业力以两种方式累积：(1)我们当前累积的业力； (2)我们通过回顾生活在过去而累积的业力。

We exist in event space,not time,and as such event space has no boundaries. Event space exists concurrently. As a result,all that is related to what we call time (past,present and future)exists simultaneously in different "spheres"of events in specific areas of space which pervade the multiverse and beyond. Because event space is always with us,it is easy for us to accrue karma retrospectively,and,many incarnates attract karma in this way.  

我们存在于事件空间，而不是时间，因此事件空间没有边界。事件空间同时存在。因此，所有与我们称之为时间(过去、现在和未来)相关的事物同时存在于遍布多维宇宙和超越的特定空间区域的不同“领域”的事件中。由于事件空间总是与我们在一起，我们很容易回顾性地累积业力，许多化身以这种方式吸引业力。

The only antidote is for us to live in the moment and refuse to be drawn into discussions about previous bad events or what bad event could happen in the future,based upon current trends. To do this,we should offer thanks to the antagonists and bid them good day,seeking instead good spiritually aware company. 

对我们来说，唯一的解药就是活在当下，拒绝被卷入过去的坏事或基于当前趋势的未来可能发生的坏事的讨论中。为了做到这一点，我们应该向对手表示感谢，祝他们好运，而不是寻找精神上好的伙伴。

### Existing in a Two-Year Sphere 

**困于“两年球体”中**

As incarnate beings,we exist in a two-year sphere where we only relate to that which occurred in event spaces up to the previous twelve months and those event spaces which relate to our plans within the next/upcoming twelve months. When we exist in this way, we are in constant exposure to similar or the same experiences unless we are capable of applying the content from lessons learnt in previous and similar experiences.  

作为转世存有，我们存在于一个两年的领域，我们只与发生在过去十二个月事件空间中的事情相关，以及那些与我们未来十二个月计划相关的事件空间。当我们以这种方式存在时，我们不断地暴露在类似或相同的经历中，除非我们能够应用从以前和类似经历中学习的内容。

It is only when we have an event that causes us to re-focus,such as an accident,health problem or employment issue,that we bring in events from previous "related"event spaces outside the two-year sphere to assist us in resolving the problem or introducing the processes required to re-focus. In these instances we exit the current physical reality and encompass the inclusive "greater reality"which includes past,present and future events.  Future events are only available to those with certain evolutionary content and subsequent base frequential aspects to support clairvoyance,clairaudience,and clairsentience,etc.  

只有当我们有一个事件，使我们重新聚焦，例如事故、健康问题或就业问题，我们才会从两年的领域之外的以前“相关”事件空间中带来事件，以帮助我们解决问题或引入重新聚焦所需的过程。在这些情况下，我们退出当前的物理现实，并包括包容性的“更大的现实”，包括过去、现在和未来的事件。未来的事件只对那些具有某些进化内容和随后的基本频率方面，以支持超视力、超听觉和超感知等的人可用。

Pulling in experiences from event spaces outside the two-year sphere is a clear advantage because then we are able to recognize opportunities for not making mistakes similar to those previously made and thus not incur cyclic karma. Thus the antidote is our ability to exist within the two-year sphere,living in the moment as much as possible while drawing upon experiences from events outside the two-year sphere as much as possible. Learning the lesson once and applying that learning to our current experiences is preferable to experiencing and dealing with that experience as if it was the first time. 

从两年外的空间中吸取经验是一个明显的优势，因为这样我们就能认识到不犯类似于以前所犯错误的机会，从而避免循环业力。因此，解药是我们存在于两年内的能力，尽可能地活在当下，同时尽可能地从两年外的空间中吸取经验。学习一次经验并将所学应用于我们当前的经验，比起像第一次那样去经历和处理经验，是更可取的。

### Recognizing Previous Actions/Reactions 

**认出从前的行为或反应**

Cyclic karma repeats itself in a known cyclic fashion when we have not quite learnt a specific lesson well enough to ensure that our repeated exposure to it will result in our choosing the correct "educated"action. Its function is twofold:(1)to expose us to similar experiences that achieve the same karmic result if the original is not recognized,and (2)to check if we have learned the process that made the karmic link in the first place.  

当我们还没有完全学到一个具体的教训时，循环业力就会以一种已知的循环方式重复它自己，以确保我们重复接触它将导致我们选择正确的“受教育的”行为。它的功能是双重的：(1)如果原始的教训没有被认识到，它会让我们接触到类似的经历，从而达到同样的业力结果，(2)检查我们是否已经学会了最初形成业力联系的过程。

When we recognize the processes that result in same or similar experiences,then we can act to ensure that we make the correct response/s whenever we are exposed to these experiences. In this way,we break the cycle of cyclic karma.  In this instance the antidote is for us to be vigilant,looking out for that which repeats itself and noting how we respond. Our goal is to endeavor not to repeat the responses that resulted in our lesson not being fully learnt and the karmic link being repeated. 

当我们认识到导致相同或类似经历的过程时，我们就可以采取行动，以确保我们在面对这些经历时做出正确的反应。这样，我们就打破了循环业力的循环。在这种情况下，对我们来说，解药是警惕，留意那些重复出现的事情，并注意我们的反应。我们的目标是努力不重复导致我们没有完全学到教训和重复业力联系的反应。

### Avoiding Cyclic Karma 

**避免循环业力**

Downward spiraling karma is repetitive (cyclic)karma that results in a gradual but ever increasing attraction to lower frequency existence with additionally increasing severity.  In this instance our accrued karma attracts more karma (lower frequencies)the more we ignore repeated learning opportunities and actively choose to avoid the corrective action necessary to arrest their development.  

螺旋式恶业是重复(循环)的业力，导致逐渐但不断增加的低频存在吸引力，并伴随着不断增加的严重性。在这种情况下，我们积累的业力吸引更多的业力(低频)，我们越忽视重复学习的机会，并积极选择避免采取必要的纠正行动来阻止它们的发展。

When we are caught in the clutches of downwardly spiraling karma,it is extremely difficult, if not impossible,for us to reverse the trend on our own-unless,of course,this is part of our life plan. In this instance we need to be in acceptance of the observations and comments of those around us who can see the downward spiral occurring and accept the help they offer us. This takes humility on our part,which is a difficult personal thought process for us to adopt when we are "in the middle"of the spiral. It also needs true "resilient"friends to be our helpers when we are stuck in this type of karma,for they will encounter many episodes of resistance where they are not thanked for their help. 

当我们被捕捉到螺旋式恶业的爪子时，我们很难，如果不是不可能的话，靠我们自己来扭转趋势——当然，除非这是我们生命计划的一部分。在这种情况下，我们需要接受周围那些看到螺旋式恶化发生的人的观察和评论，并接受他们提供的帮助。这需要我们谦卑，当我们处于螺旋的“中间”时，这是一个困难的个人思考过程。当我们陷入这种类型的业力时，还需要真正“有弹性”的朋友来帮助我们，因为他们会遇到许多抗拒的插曲，因为他们的帮助没有得到感谢。

### Grieving 

**悲伤** 

Grieving is an essential part of our experiential existence in the physical;however,if it is taken too far,it can become a trap of the physical leading to karma.  

悲伤是我们在物质层体验存在的必要部分； 然而，如果它走得太远，它会成为导致业力的物质陷阱。

Grieving itself focuses on our personal losses which are augmented by the passage of a multitude of shared experiences based upon the physical presence of an individual.  

悲伤本身聚焦于我们个人的损失，这被基于个人物质存在而通过大量共享经验的传递而放大。

Grieving brings us great sorrow,which is not a true reflection of the experiences we've enjoyed;therefore,it distorts and dominates the memories of the joys previously experienced.  

悲伤带给我们巨大的悲痛，这不是我们所享受的体验的真实反映；因此，它扭曲并支配了以前经历的快乐的记忆。

Although it can be difficult,the antidote is to change the focus from the immediate loss and reflect on the years of joy experienced in the presence of the incarnate that has now departed the physical form and ascended back into the natural frequencies of domicile. We must not dwell in the past(previous event spaces),for this is another form of karma. Instead,it is wise to wistfully remember that our incarnate life together was such an adventure and plan the next. 

虽然这可能很难，但解药是改变焦点，从眼前的损失，并反思在现在已经离开物质形态并提升回居住地的自然频率的化身存在下经历的快乐岁月。我们不应停留在过去(以前的事件空间)，因为这是业力的另一种形式。相反，明智的做法是渴望地记住我们一起的化身生活是这样一个冒险，并计划下一个。

### Living in the Past 

**活在过去** 

Living in the past is a trap of the physical leading to karma. It leads us to comparison, dissatisfaction,negative reflection and inability to be in the present. The objective of being in the present and not the past is for us to take that which was experienced in the past and use it to affect correct responses to challenges that are presented to us in the"now. " 

活在过去是一个陷阱，会导致业力。它会导致我们比较、不满、消极的反思和无法活在当下。活在当下而不是过去的目标是让我们接受过去的经历，并利用它来正确应对“现在”摆在我们面前的挑战。

Saying that we could have done better when reflecting on actions we made in the past,based upon what we knew at the time or thinking/stating that "things"were better in the past, only creates dissatisfaction with our past performance. This creates a continuous regime of negative reflection.  

当我们回想过去的行为时，基于我们当时所知道的，或者认为/陈述“事情”在过去更好时，我们说我们本可以做得更好，这只会让我们对过去的表现感到不满。这会导致一个持续的消极反思。

We act and react based upon our experience and ability to deal with that presented to us.  How we determine the "quality of an event"is how we deal with that presented to us using the tools of ability and prior experience. Accepting that how we reacted and acted was the best that we could have achieved in those circumstances is called "living in the now. " When we recognize this,it negates our need to constantly refer to the past in comparison to the "near present"or "now. "This then allows us to move forward in our evolutionary growth rather than turning that achieved into a function of karma,based upon physical performance.  

我们基于我们的经验和处理摆在我们面前的事情的能力来行动和反应。我们如何决定“事件的质量”是我们如何使用能力和先前经验的工具来处理摆在我们面前的事情。接受我们如何反应和行动是我们在那些情况下可以达到的最好结果，这被称为“活在当下”。当我们认识到这一点时，它否定了我们不断地与“最近”或“现在”相比，参考过去的需要。这让我们在进化中前进，而不是把它变成业力的功能，基于身体表现。

This does not negate the need to learn from our mistakes,but it does negate the need to chastise ourselves when we spot our "mistakes"retrospectively. 

这并不否定从错误中学习的必要性，但它否定了当我们回顾自己的“错误”时惩罚自己的必要性。

### Being Grateful 

**心怀感激**

When we show gratitude for a good deed someone extends to us,it encourages further good deeds. We can extend gratitude when we personally receive a good deed,as well as when someone else receives one. Indeed,our expressing gratitude is a mark of recognition not only for the deed itself and its importance but also for the thoughtfulness of the giver in seeing our needs or those of others.  

当我们对他人为我们做的好事表示感激时，这会鼓励更多的好事发生。当我们自己受到善举时，以及当别人受到善举时，我们都可以表达感激之情。事实上，我们表达感激不仅仅是对善举本身及其重要性的认可，也是对施予者看到我们或他人需求的体贴的认可。

We must not,however,give false gratitude that merely acknowledges the deed for acknowledgement's sake,for this is as negative as giving no gratitude at all.  

然而，我们不应该虚假地表达感激，仅仅为了认可而认可善举，因为这与根本不表示感激一样消极。

Simply appreciating that which has been done for us or others extends gratitude to that which has been done in a passive way. Passive gratitude is "received"energetically by the doer of the good deed,as well as subliminal encouragement.  

简单地欣赏为我们或他人所做的善事，以一种被动的方式向所做的事情表示感激。被动的感激被善举的实施者积极地“接受”，以及潜意识的鼓励。

The promotion of good deeds through gratitude is,therefore,an accelerant. There is a pattern here. The more encouragement we or others receive though truly given or received gratitude,the more we or others will do good deeds,eventually elevating ourselves to the level where good deeds are normal for us,and we will no longer need for recognition for them. At this point in our development,we will be in true service,avoiding karma in the process. 

因此，通过感激来促进善行是一种加速剂。这里有一个模式。我们或他人通过真正给予或接受感激而获得的鼓励越多，我们或他人就会做更多的善事，最终将我们自己提升到善行对我们来说是正常的水平，我们将不再需要为它们而得到认可。在我们发展的这个阶段，我们将会真正地服务，避免在过程中产生业力。

### Being Mindful 

**秉持正念** 

Being mindful of how we function whilst incarnate is an excellent tool in our battle against accruing karma. Being mindful means that we give ourselves enough time to think about what our environment is,how we are being affected by it,how we are being affected by who and what is in our environment,and how we can efficiently deal with who and what is affecting us without creating low frequency attachments of any kind:transient,short, medium or long term.  

当我们转世时，留意我们如何运作，是我们对抗累积业力的绝佳工具。留意意味着我们给自己足够的时间去思考我们的环境是什么，我们是如何被它所影响的，我们是如何被我们环境中的人和事物所影响的，以及我们如何能有效地处理谁和什么在影响我们的同时，不创造任何类型的低频依附：短暂的，短期的，中期的或长期的。

In this instance,we as mindful incarnates can see all the possible links to low frequency or karma-generating responses or reactions so we can avoid them with ease and maximize their incarnate evolutionary potential at every opportunity. This is true even in adverse environments or conditions. 

在这种情况下，我们作为有正念的转世存有，可以看见所有可能与低频或产生业力的反应或反应有关的链接，所以我们可以轻松地避免它们，并在每一个机会中最大化他们的转世进化潜力。即使在不利的环境或条件下也是如此。

### Gaining Mindful Appreciation 

**拥抱正念的欣赏** 

Appreciation through mindfulness is a very powerful way for us to tune into the functionality of the physical universe we exist within.  

通过正念的欣赏是一种非常强大的方式，让我们调谐到我们生存的物质宇宙的功能。

If we are mindful enough to see beyond our initial experience to observe the beauty in the interactive properties of what we are experiencing,then we can accept every experience and whatever it brings with an appreciation of the underlying evolutionary opportunities being presented to us and welcome them with open arms-thus avoiding karmic forces. 

如果我们足够正念，能看到我们最初的经验，观察我们正在经历的互动性质中的美丽，那么我们可以接受每一个经验和它所带来的任何东西，欣赏它呈现给我们的潜在进化机会，并张开双臂欢迎它们——从而避免业力。

### Observing the Details 

**观察细节** 

When we show appreciation through mindfulness,it allows us to experience the minute details of physical existence. For example,we may observe the work behind the presentation of the foods we eat.  

当我们通过正念表达感激时，它让我们体验到物质存在的细微细节。例如，我们可以观察我们吃的食物背后的工作。

We can do this from so many perspectives,for example,seeing or thinking about the planting of a seed,the growing and nurturing of the vegetable,harvesting the crop,washing and preparing it for sale,delivering it from the farmer to the shop and then to our larder,and from our larder to the cooker and then noting all the work of the cook or chef to bring it to our plate. We note some or all the work done to get this food to us to taste and experience and the energy we gain,the zest we feel when energized by the food.  

我们可以从许多角度来做，例如，看到或思考种子的种植，蔬菜的生长和培育，收割庄稼，清洗和准备出售，从农民到商店，然后到我们的食品柜，从我们的食品柜到炊具，然后注意厨师或主厨把它放到我们盘子里的所有工作。我们注意到一些或所有做的工作，把食物送到我们面前，让我们品尝和体验，以及我们获得的能量，当食物给我们能量时我们感受到的热情。

When we are appreciative through mindfulness and recognize the work required to deliver what we need in our everyday incarnate existence,we offer no negativity and are grateful for what we receive,irrespective of what it is. We give thanks and encouragement. Our doing so,promotes high frequency responses in the process and avoid the potential low frequency responses relating to karma. 

当我们通过正念表达感激时，并认识到在我们每天的化身存在中，需要提供我们所需要的东西，我们没有提供任何消极，并对我们所收到的东西心存感激，无论它是什么。我们表示感谢和鼓励。我们这样做，促进了高频率的反应，并避免了潜在的与业有关的低频率反应。

### Balancing Our Experiences 

**平衡我们的体验** 

Experiences that we classify as bad or "sub-optimal,"such as the loss of a loved one,the loss of a position of power/responsibility,an accident in our motor vehicle,or a paint can spilling on the carpet while decorating our home are all part of our undergoing a balanced set of experiences in the physical.  

我们把经历归类为坏的或“次优的”，例如失去一个爱人，失去一个权力/责任的位置，在我们的机动车上发生事故，或在装修房子时把油漆罐溅到地毯上，这些都是我们在物质世界经历的平衡的一部分。

We expect good things to happen to us all of the time whilst incarnate and,as such,we tend to focus only on those things that we classify as good or "optimal. "We ignore the importance of experiencing the so-called bad or "sub-optimal"situations. However,it is how we respond to these sub-optimal experiences in comparison to the optimal ones that dictates whether or not we are consumed by being "in"the experience.  

我们希望好事总是发生在我们身上，因此，我们往往只关注那些我们归类为好事或“最佳”的事。我们忽略了经历所谓的坏事或“次优”情况的重要性。然而，与最佳体验相比，我们对这些次优体验的反应决定了我们是否被“在”体验中消耗。

When we experience optimal events and pay little or no attention to them,we are "part of them"but "not of them"unless,of course,the ego has a part to play in the optimal experience. When we experience sub-optimal events,we pay a lot of attention to them and become "of them"but not "part of them. "In the latter,we forget the bigger picture that these experiences include,and the result is an unwilling attraction to the lower frequency responses associated with the experience through emotions,such as disappointment.  

当我们经历最佳事件时，我们很少或不注意它们，我们是“它们的一部分”，但“不是它们的一部分”，除非，当然，自我在最佳体验中发挥了作用。当我们经历次优事件时，我们对它们给予很多关注，成为“它们的一部分”，但不是“它们的一部分”。在后者中，我们忘记了这些经历所包含的更大的图景，结果是不情愿地通过情感吸引到与经历相关的低频反应，如失望。

The antidote that is written several times throughout this guide is to stand back and see what the experience offers us as a lesson. We must take time to see what the correct response route is. Have we learned the lesson and gained the evolutionary content attributed to the experience? With this knowledge in mind,we can see the beauty and its timeliness in the experience and then rise above the opportunity for entrapment in the lower frequencies. 

本指南多次提到的解药是退后一步，看看这些经历给我们上了什么课。我们必须花时间看看正确的反应路线是什么。我们是否学到了教训，并获得了归因于经验的进化内容？有了这些知识，我们可以看到经验中的美丽和及时性，然后超越低频陷阱的机会。

###  Smiling in Adversity 

**在逆境中微笑** 

Smiling in the face of adversity is an excellent way for us to remain in a high frequency existence whilst we are incarnate. Smiling in the face of adversity means that we are not consumed by the lower frequencies of the adverse condition but are "in joy"at the opportunity of dealing with the challenge/s presented to us. 

面对逆境微笑，是让我们在世间保持高频率的一种极好的方式。面对逆境微笑意味着我们不会被低频率的逆境所吞噬，而是“欢喜”地抓住处理眼前挑战的机会。

### Remembering:the Key to Avoiding Karma 

**忆起我们自己，回避业力的关键**

Remembrance,particularly of who and what we are and why we are here is the ultimate key for us to avoid karma.  

忆起，特别是我们是谁，我们是什么，我们为什么在这里，是我们避免业力的最终关键。

Through diligent daily meditations,we as incarnate individuals can establish communion with the greater reality. Thus,we gain comfort that incarnate existence is but a transient part of our total existence and understand our part within it. This allows us to look deeper into "what is,"which will allow untapped levels of our energetic memories to become accessible and thus in increase our levels of "knowing,"which "is"a function of remembrance.  

通过勤奋的日常冥想，我们作为化身的个体可以建立与更大的现实的沟通。因此，我们获得安慰，化身的存在只是我们全部存在的短暂部分，并理解我们其中的一部分。这使我们能够更深入地看“是什么”，这将使我们未开发的能量记忆水平变得可访问，从而增加我们的“知道”水平，这“是”记忆的功能。

When we are in "remembrance,we know how to react in an optimal way to all experiences in all environments and navigate with ease through the maelstrom of opportunities for low frequency attachment-thus avoiding karma. 

 当我们在“忆起”中，我们知道如何以最佳的方式对所有环境中的所有经验做出反应，并轻松地通过低频率依恋的机会漩涡导航，从而避免业力。

### Source Entity's Words of Wisdom to Avoid Karma 

**源实体关于回避业力的智慧语言**

In this section I have included a number of the Source Entity's "words of wisdom"that I felt should accompany the ways to avoid karma presented in this book. Each one has been specifically chosen because of the way it augments the guidance already given. Indeed,in terms of advice,each is more than capable of "standing on its own two feet,"so to speak, which is why it is included.  

在这部分我已经包括了一些源实体的“智慧之言”，我觉得应该伴随本书中提出的避免业力的方法。每一个都被特别选择，因为它增强了已经给出的指导。事实上，就建议而言，每一个都能够“独立地站立”，这就是为什么它被包括在内。

When the Source uses the word "we,"it is considering Itself as one with all of us-as us. As we experience,It experiences. As we learn,It learns. As we evolve,It evolves.  

当源头使用“我们”这个词时，它认为自己与我们所有人是一体的——就像我们一样。当我们经历时，它也经历。当我们学习时，它也学习。当我们进化时，它也进化。

We must become our own gurus and stop to consider what is being presented to us via experiences and run a number of "what if"scenarios before we decide what to do. Then we choose the optimal response and record the result. If the response chosen was not the optimal response,we look at what made us choose that response in the first place and make a mental note not to repeat it in that scenario again.  

我们必须成为自己的大师，在我们决定做什么之前，停下来考虑通过经验呈现给我们的东西，并运行一些“如果”场景。然后我们选择最佳的反应，并记录结果。如果选择的反应不是最佳的反应，我们看看是什么让我们首先选择那个反应，并在心里记住不要再在那个场景中重复它。

When we learn from choosing certain responses and recording the outcomes mentally,we develop a database of known paths or processes to follow when we are confronted with a similar new experience. Thus we ensure we will have a successful response the next time and thereafter. In essence,when we learn the lessons and robustly apply that learning,we are not only good students but also good teachers,for the student and the teacher are one and the same.  

当我们从选择某些反应和心理上记录结果中学习时，我们开发了一个已知的路径或过程数据库，当我们面临类似的新经验时，我们可以遵循它。因此，我们确保下一次以及以后的每次反应都将是成功的。本质上，当我们吸取教训并积极地运用所学时，我们不仅是好学生，也是好老师，因为学生和老师是一体的。

The light within is the light without. Unless we are able to accept that our light is within,we will not shine without. When we accept the light within,we are in the knowledge that we are a beautiful being,one with our Creator,perfect in every way,and nothing outside us will extinguish this inner light.  

内在的光就是外在的光。除非我们能够接受我们的光在内在，否则我们不会在外面发光。当我们接受内在的光时，我们知道我们是一个美丽的存在，与我们的造物主同在，在各方面都是完美的，我们之外的任何东西都不会熄灭这内在的光。

The light of beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder,it is within our spiritual eye if we can behold it within ourselves.  

美的光不仅仅是在旁观者的眼中，如果我们能从我们自己身上看到它，它就在我们精神之眼里。

The roads to God are many and varied,but whatever road we take,we must make it our own.  We must be persistent and patient and not enticed by the road of another,which may seem faster but actually isn't.  

通往上帝的道路是多种多样的，但无论我们选择哪条路，我们必须让它成为我们自己的。我们必须坚持不懈，耐心，不要被别人的路所诱惑，这可能看起来更快，但实际上不是。

If we are selfish,it is OK,provided we are only selfish in seeking the road towards communion with God.  

如果我们是自私的，这没关系，只要我们只是在寻找通往与上帝交流的道路上的自私。

When we are calm and adapt to change without apportioning blame,we possess the ticket to ascending with the ascension.  

当我们冷静地适应变化，不责备时，我们拥有随着提升而提升的门票。

Ascension is inevitable provided we continue questioning our reason for existence and thus maintain our desire to know why and how our universe was created.  

提升是不可避免的，只要我们继续质疑我们存在的理由，从而保持我们想知道我们的宇宙为什么和如何被创造的愿望。

Meditation is the ability to concentrate 100% on God,and as a result,to become aware of God's presence.  

冥想是一种100%专注于上帝的能力，因此，我们会意识到上帝的存在。

Fear is the barrier the ego uses to keep us from communion with God,as communion with God results in loss of ego.  

我们必须在我们的内心深处寻找上帝，因为我们知道上帝的存在。恐惧是自我用来阻止我们与神沟通的障碍，因为与神沟通会导致自我的丧失。

Why fear that which we are part of? God loves us because we are part of God. Because we are part of God,we are loved by God and can experience God. However,God can only be experienced by looking inwards and being quiet and still.  

为什么害怕我们自身的一部分？上帝爱我们，因为我们是上帝的一部分。因为我们是上帝的一部分，我们被上帝所爱，并能体验上帝。然而，上帝只能通过向内看，保持安静和宁静来体验。

In the search for oneness with God,we must first open the door of the heart. Only then will God step through the doorway.  

在寻找与上帝合一的过程中，我们必须首先打开心灵之门。只有这样，上帝才会踏入门槛。

Our reason to be is to awaken in God,know God,be one with God,and be God whilst incarnate-a simple task that we make so hard to achieve by succumbing to our physical desires.  

我们存在的理由是在上帝中觉醒，认识上帝，与上帝合一，在化身中成为上帝——一个简单的任务，但由于屈服于我们的身体欲望，我们使之变得如此困难。

Within silence there can be found God;within God there can be found silence-the silence of joy in knowing God.  

在寂静中可以找到上帝；在上帝中可以找到寂静——在认识上帝时喜悦的寂静。

Some choose to awaken comfortably. Some choose to awaken uncomfortably. Acceptance is the recipe for awakening comfortably;resistance creates discomfort.  

有些人选择舒适地觉醒。有些人选择不舒服地觉醒。接受是舒适觉醒的秘诀； 抵触会制造不适。

That which is seen by the physical eye is but a microcosm of a microcosm of a microcosm.  It is not the real reality,for the physical is a creation made by our Source Entity,our God,to allow us to experience the minute details of what has been created,the multiverse we exist within for the purpose of evolution. If we would open our eyes,we would see beyond the facade which separates it from the rest of creativity.  

用肉眼看到的只是一个微观世界的微观世界的微观世界。它不是真实的现实，因为物质世界是由我们的源头实体，我们的上帝创造的，为了进化的目的，让我们体验被创造的微小细节，我们生存的多元宇宙。如果我们能睁开我们的眼睛，我们就能看到超越了把它与其他创造力分开的外表。

To open our eyes we must be fastidious in learning to meditate,to seek the truth,to renounce that which appears to be real,to be unwavering in our desire to be part of the greater reality,to avoid getting tied up in the theater of existence in the physical,to forgive and forget,to help without expectation,to exist in love and harmony-to "BE"that which we“ARE”-“ONE”with our“Creator." 

为了睁开我们的眼睛，我们必须刻苦学习冥想，去寻找真理，去放弃那些看似真实的东西，去坚定不移地渴望成为更大的现实的一部分，去避免被束缚在物质存在剧场中，去原谅和忘记，去帮助而不期望回报，去生活在爱和和谐中——去“成为”我们“本来”的“自己”——与我们的“造物主”“合一”。

Why should we settle for consciousness in the physical when we can commune with God and gain cosmic consciousness?  

当我们可以与上帝沟通并获得宇宙意识时，为什么我们要满足于物质意识？

There is no separation. We are one with God,and God is one with us. Why seek externally that which is always within?  

没有分离。我们与上帝合一，上帝与我们合一。为什么要从外部寻找一直就在我们内部的东西？

Why do we put off contacting God today in lieu of tomorrow when we can do it today and tomorrow and the day after?

当我们可以今天、明天和后天联系上帝时，为什么我们把它推迟到明天？

God judges us by our actions,not words,so when we say we are going to meditate on God,we must DO IT!And be rewarded by communion with God and not the "thought"of communion with God.  

上帝根据我们的行动来评判我们，而不是言语，所以当我们说我们要冥想上帝时，我们必须去做！并且通过与上帝交流而非与上帝交流的“想法”而得到回报。

Embrace that which is within-God! 

拥抱上帝之内的东西！

Spiritual physics is the understanding of the existence of knowledge that is "beyond" knowledge.  

精神物理学是对知识存在的理解，那是“超越”知识的。

Whilst we are in the physical,reality is,in essence,that which "we think we know"but ultimately "will know"when we translate back into the energetic. 

当我们在物质的，实相，本质上，“我们认为我们知道”，但最终“将知道”当我们转化回能量。

It's wise to question ourselves on what reality is. It is not the mundane need to wake,work, eat,sleep and be better than someone else.  

这是明智的问我们自己什么是现实。它不是世俗的需求醒来，工作，吃饭，睡觉和比别人更好。

Forgiving is the biggest gift God has given us. It should be unconditional and instant.  

宽恕是上帝给我们的最大礼物。它应该是无条件的和即时的。

Negativity should be seen as an opportunity for creating positivity.  

消极应该被视为创造积极的机会。

To move into the multiverse whilst incarnate,we need to recognize the physical universe for what it is,and what it is not.  

转世进入多维宇宙，我们需要认识到物质宇宙是什么，它不是什么。

It "is not" the true reality;"it is"an opportunity for individual evolution.  

它“不是”真正的现实； “它”是一个个人进化的机会。

It "is not" the be-all and end-all or the opportunity to be the dog that ate the dog;"it is"to be the dog that loved the dog and shared its scraps of food in equality.  

它“不是”一切的开始和结束，或机会，成为狗吃狗； “它是”爱狗的狗，平等地分享它的食物残渣。

The physical universe is nothing but a theater,a play we created,an opportunity for us to endeavor to remember our lines and our actions when we are faced with the experiences we have chosen. For this reason everything we do is within the play,a play manifested in the theater called Earth.  

物质宇宙只是一个剧院，一个我们创造的戏剧，一个机会，让我们努力记住我们的台词和我们的行动，当我们面对我们选择的经验时。因此，我们所做的一切都是在戏剧中，一个在地球剧院中显化的戏剧。

We must be discerning in relation to our work and take onboard only that which resonates with us as truth. There is a lot of spiritual text that is written by the ego or is "band-waggoning"rather than coming from the source of truth. We must take onboard that which resonates with us as being correct. 

我们必须对我们的工作有辨别力，只接受与我们共鸣的真理。有很多精神文本是由自我写的，或者是“大摇大摆”，而不是来自真理的源头。我们必须接受与我们共鸣的正确性。

Many teachers today present the same information in different ways. This is necessary because we are all at different levels of evolution and awakening. More importantly,we all learn in different ways of absorbing and experientially knowing. So what may be kindergarten spiritualism to one person may be high spiritualism to another. Ascension is, therefore,for all of us.  

今天许多老师以不同的方式呈现相同的信息。这是必要的，因为我们都在不同的进化和觉醒水平上。更重要的是，我们都以不同的方式学习吸收和体验性地认识。所以，对一个人来说可能是幼儿园灵性主义的东西，对另一个人来说可能是高级灵性主义。因此，提升是为我们所有人的。

Seeking to understand where we are in comparison to another is not good practice,for it introduces jealousy or ego.  

试图理解我们与另一个人相比不是好的做法，因为它引入了嫉妒或自我。

Dates are a great misnomer as we become confused when nothing discernible happens that can be attributed to the date. They can,however,be used as a milestone to indicate that we (collectively)should have reached a certain level of frequency.  

日期是一个伟大的误用，因为当没有什么可辨别的发生可以归因于日期时，我们变得困惑。然而，它们可以被用作一个里程碑，表明我们(集体)应该达到一个特定的频率水平。

We ARE ascending through the frequencies at a sustainable and robust pace,one that will allow us to have minor setbacks without affecting our overall process of ascension.  The knife-edge ascension that most spiritualists desire is not optimal,nor is it sustainable because it is just as easy to descend as it is to ascend the frequencies. With a big jump,the drop can be just as big.  

我们正在以可持续和强健的步伐通过频率提升，这将允许我们有小的挫折而不影响我们的整体提升进程。大多数灵性主义者渴望的刀刃提升不是最佳的，也不是可持续的，因为它就像是上升频率一样容易下降。随着一个大的跳跃，下降可以是同样大的。

If we are all one,how can we be singular? If we are all singular,how can we be all one?  

如果我们都是一体的，我们怎么能是单一的？如果我们都是单一的，我们怎么能成为一体？

The answer is that we are all the collective totality of the entity we call God. 

答案是我们都是我们称之为上帝的实体的整体。

Physicality to Energetic/Super-Conscious Mind Equation 

肉体到能量/超意识心灵等式

Physicality (incarnate self)minus the conscious mind minus the subconscious mind equals the super conscious or energetic mind.  

肉体(化身自我)减去意识心灵减去潜意识心灵等于超意识或能量心灵。

i. e. ,((P-CM)-SM) = SC/EM 

即，((P-CM)-SM)=SC/EM

or

或者

((Physicality-Conscious Mind) - Sub Conscious Mind) = Super Conscious/Energetic Mind

**((肉体-意识心)-潜意识)=超意识/能量**

### About the author 

**关于作者**

Guy Needler MBA,MSc,CEng,MIET,MCMA initially trained as a mechanical engineer and quickly progressed on to be a chartered electrical and electronics engineer. However, throughout this earthly training he was always aware of the greater reality being around him,catching glimpses of the worlds of spirit. This resulted in a period from his teenage to early twenties where he revelled in the spiritual texts of the day and meditated intensively. Being subsequently told by his guides to focus on his earthly contribution for a period he scaled this back the intensity of spiritual work until his late thirties where he was re-awakened to his spiritual roles. The next six years saw him gaining his Reiki Master and a four year commitment to learn energy and vibrational therapy techniques from Helen Stott, a direct student of the Barbara Brennan School of HealingTM,which also included a personal development undertaking (including psychotherapy)as a course prerequisite using the PathworkTM methodology described by Susan Thesenga with further methodologies by Donovan Thesenga,John and Eva Pierrakos. His training and experience in energy based therapies have resulted in him being a member of the Complementary Medical Association (MCMA).  

盖伊·尼德勒，工商管理硕士，理学硕士，特许工程师，工程技术学会会员，替代医疗协会会员。早期受训成为机械工程师，随即晋升为特许电力电子工程师。不过，在尘世的培训当中，他一直意识到世上有更高的实相，并得以瞥见灵性的世界。这使他从青少年时期到二十多岁的岁月里，沉浸在灵性书籍且勤奋地投入到静心冥想中。随后，指导灵以一种特殊的方式与他沟通，需将重心暂时放在对尘世的贡献上。于是他减少了灵性上的探索，直到将近四十岁时，他又再度被唤醒，重归灵性角色。接下来的六年里，他获得了灵气疗法的导师资格，并用四年的时间向芭芭拉·布南能（Barbara Brennan）的直系学生海伦·斯托特（Helen Stott）学习能量与频率治疗技术。在校期间，他也学习了个人发展与实践，包括心理疗法这一预修课程。该课程使用的道途法由苏珊·赛森格（Susan Thesenga）提出，并由多诺万·赛森格（Donovan Thesenga），约翰（John）与伊娃·皮拉克斯（Eva Pierrakos）等人进一步发展。之后，能量治疗方面的培训和经验，使他成为了替代医疗协会（MCMA）会员。

Along with his healing abilities his spiritual associations include being able to channel information from spirit including constant contact with other entities within our multiverse and his higher self and guides. It is the channelling that has resulted in The History of God,Beyond the Source and is producing further work. 

除了能量疗愈方面的能力，他的灵性能力还包括能够传递灵界信息，以及持续与我们多维宇宙中各种实体及存有、他的高我及指导灵保持接触。《源头简史》正是源于他的深度冥想传导，且他正在带来更多的颠覆传统认知的著作。

As a method of grounding Guy practises and teaches Aikido. He is a 5th Dan National Coach with 30 years experience and is currently working on the use of spiritual energy within the physical side of the art.  

盖伊还练习并传授合气道，作为一种接地的方法。在此领域他拥有三十年经验，是五段国家级教练，目前正将灵性能量融入这门艺术当中。

Guy welcomes questions on the subject of spiritual physics and who and what God is.  

盖伊热忱欢迎大家提问有关灵性物理学以及源头是谁、源头是什么的问题。
