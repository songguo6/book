### Foreword of the Foreword 

Welcome to Book 3 of the World Satsanga Series of books! 

Being the third in the series of three books, the foreword written in The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 1 - Lectures on the Greater Reality, fundamentally carries over to this book, simply because it’s the history of the World Satsanga, hence it being below. 

Another reason for having the same foreword is that it is entirely possible that this book is the first book that a reader looks at simply because the subject matter that they are interested in is in this book and not the first one. If then, dear reader you read The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 1 - Lectures on the Greater Reality, or Book 2 - Questions and Channelled Answers on the Greater Reality, then this foreword is just to remind you of how these books came to be. If however, this is the first book in the World Satsanga series you are reading then the foreword below will explain how it materialised. 

Suffice to say the only real difference between The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 2 - Questions and Channeled Answers on the Greater Reality and Book 3 is the fact that they are in progressive alphabetical order of the subject matter and that it would have been too large a volume to digest in one go. Alternatively, if the subject matter you are interested in is in one book, you may not be interested in the other! 

As you will read below this book has been transcribed and compiled from the original recordings by Ulla Sarmiento, who by the way, has been working overtime to get this book in the same Event Space as Books 1 & 2. 

I hope you enjoy the foreword below and the depth of information coming from some very searching questions.

### Foreword 

Welcome to The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 3 - Questions and Channelled Answers on the Greater Reality. 

If, dear reader you read The World Satsanga: The First Ten Years Book 1 - Lectures on the Greater Reality, and Book 2, the first Questions and Channeled Answers book, then this foreword is just to remind you of how these books came to be. If, however, this is the first book in the World Satsanga series you are reading, then the foreword below will explain how it all materialised. 

Enjoy! 

~ ~ ~ 

When The History of God was first published, a reader contacted me and expressed an interest in a dialogue. This dialogue continued for some time and resulted in two things. One; a monthly meeting where my readers, or people of like mind, could gain answers to questions not answered in The History of God. And two; me travelling to New Mexico in 2012 and holding a Traversing the Frequencies (TTF) workshop. I was subsequently invited back over the next couple of years and enjoyed the interest in the greater reality. It was at one of these workshops that I met a remarkable lady who was later to become a spiritual/ metaphysical influence in her own right. Her name was Ulla Sarmiento. 

The monthly meeting was to be called the “World Satsanga” and it was broadcast live on Skype. We enjoyed between 12 to 25 (the max Skype would allow) attendees each month. The format was that I would give a lecture, we would then have questions and answers, followed by an end of meeting meditation. The answers to the questions were channelled “on the spot” by me. The Satsanga would be recorded and the recording would be available via email to the attendees or those interested. It would also be blogged via my website. Ulla was a regular attendee. 

Satsanga is a Sanskrit term derived from two roots: sat meaning "true” and sangha meaning “community, company or association.” There are many other interpretations such as Satsang or Satsanga being an audience with a Satguru (religious or spiritual teacher) for religious instruction. It may also refer to other spiritual movements originating in India. However, the feeling of “being together in the truth” is the one that resonates with me the most. World Satsanga therefore means a “a world together in the truth” in my mind. 

The World Satsanga has changed over the years, including being pre-recorded with the questions and answers being emailed to me prior to transmission. However, more recently it has stabilised to being a pre-recorded lecture and meditation with the questions and answers being broadcast live via Zoom. The final recording being everything edited together as one file and broadcast on YouTube. 

During 2016 Ulla announced that she transcribed the Satsangas for her own reference, asking me if I would like to transmit the transcriptions on a monthly basis together with the video/ audio files. We both thought it would be perfect for those with hearing difficulties or were not so “connected” to the internet, whose connected friends could print them off and distribute them. We felt this was a perfect solution and the transcriptions flowed each month. 

Transcription is hard work by the way! 

Over the years I would get the odd nudge from attendees or readers/ listeners of the World Satsanga broadcasts suggesting that it would be nice to have a book written on some of the subjects broached. Yes, I would say and then completely forget about it as I was too engrossed in writing my latest book. However, this possibility, or Event Space, was not to go away. 

In 2021 the World Satsanga was ten years old and Ulla emailed me to say that she was seeing the same questions being asked and the answers being repeated. Prior to this if the same questions were asked new information would be channelled by me. With the change in format to be introduced in January 2022 back to live video questions and answers we therefore decided to call a close to the transcriptions, because they were still available on my website for those who wanted to read them. 

It was late 2021 that inspiration, or Event Space, suddenly came into focus. YES! We should make a book out of the lectures, questions and answers arising from the Satsangas. Now was the time. I quickly emailed Ulla who instantly agreed it was a good idea. However, she had only transcribed the Satsangas from 2016 onwards! Did I have the earlier recordings? I noted that in saving space on my website, some of the earlier recordings were deleted, so I was suddenly worried. Luckily though, I had archived them and we had a complete set. 

In the meantime Ulla had moved house and country! And needed to work on her own publications and website before commencing the unbelievable amount of work transcribing the earlier recordings and starting to compile the text. When Ulla became available we decided that it was best to work on the questions and answers first and see how large that task was before looking at the lectures. As it happened the questions and answers needed two “large” books. This book on the lectures was a fast follower but with heavy editing, mainly due to repetition of lecture subject matter over the years, we thought would fit into a single book. 

Even though the questions and answers books were finished first, we decided that, as with the format of the World Satsanga, the lectures should come first with the questions and answers coming second and third, hence this being book one! 

The book on lectures is compiled in an “alphabetically organised subject order” with the material for each subject together in the same section for ease of indexing and reading. Please note that if additional or new material was broadcast from lectures of the same subject matter, then that was included to make it one lecture. 

The same compilation strategy is used for the questions and answers books, with this book— Q& A Book 2 (World Satsanga Book 3) hosting Questions and Answers continued from M-Z. 

Without doubt this first World Satsanga, and subsequent books, would not have materialised without the help, interest, motivation, intuition, dedication, encouragement, friendship and VERY HARD WORK of Ulla Sarmiento. 

Indeed, this particular Event Space would not exist without her! Something to think about dear reader! 

THANK YOU ULLA FOR BEING HERE ON THIS PLANET

### Meditation 

**In The Curators Source said that you have been working with Source, its peers and the Origin for long enough to be supremely confident in this information. Are you?**

Channeling information is a higher function than meditation. I don't feel unconfident. I don't feel uncomfortable with it. It feels right. That's the thing. If something doesn't feel right, you shouldn't be broadcasting it. If there's any doubts about it, you shouldn't be broadcasting about it in any way, shape or form. 

If there is a difference between one person's information and somebody else's information, we have to consider the fact that maybe it's the same thing, but said in a different way or maybe there's an error somewhere. If there's any function of the information that could be classified as an error, then it's not broadcast. For me, it feels right, it feels true, so I don't have any problems with the information at all. I'm very confident in it (1/ 2021). 

**Our Source has urged us to meditate at least 30 minutes a day. What is the fundamental purpose of meditation? Is meditation a more resting state? What is the purpose of channeling? Is channeling a more aware, questioning and receiving state?** 

Meditation is a function of disassociation from the physical. It’s one way of achieving connectivity with Self, Source and other beings. It creates the possibility of channeling, which is a higher function than meditation. It is part of the awareness and awakening process. It’s also one of the functions of enlightenment— not THE function of enlightenment. 

It’s one of them and it leads to the enlightenment process. The whole point of it is to learn to connect with the greater reality, to be in the greater reality and commune, converse and interact with the greater reality, and not just the reality that the human form connects with. That’s the whole point of it. 

The problem is when our eyes are open, our ears are hearing, our nose is smelling and our mouth is tasting, we are immersed in the human state. We are confused by that state to the point where we are in the full belief that we are the human body, so we need to move ourselves out of that zone. Meditation can get us there. 

When we get to being an enlightened yogi or individual, we’re able with meditation to turn off the senses, so we can enter into a complete state of solitude. No amount of noise or visual interaction will move us out of that state. That means that a good yogi can meditate with their eyes open. 

If you look at the old religious paintings, you’ll see that a lot of saints have got their eyes pointing up towards their third eye. That’s because they’re in “samadhi” or a state of enlightenment or awareness whilst they are incarnate. 

That illustrates to me that the individuals who were painting those images understood that these people were in communion with God or Source all the time, because their eyes were pointing towards the third eye— although they were here, they weren’t all here. 

They were communing with the greater reality at the same time. Meditation helps us to switch off our association with this particular environment in our human form and helps us to move through the possibility of channeling, which is sort of a lower function in terms of the communication with that greater environment and the beings within the greater reality (5/ 2017). 

**What is the significance of the pose during meditation? Is one pose more effective than another? Which one is the best pose for meditation?** 

The Hindus have got this nailed. The best posture is sitting in the lotus position or cross-legged with the back erect and the shoulders relaxed as well. The eyes are closed and gently focused on the origin of the spiritual or third eye. With the back erect and focus on the third eye, it allows us to create an uninhibited line of travel for the energies within the spine. 

Then when we meditate properly and we breathe properly in pranayama, the energy moves up and down the spine and activates certain plexuses associated with the chakras. When that happens, that elevates our frequencies. If we sit in a crouched position, we're inhibiting that flow, so having the spine erect is the best way forwards. 

You can also meditate lying down if you wanted to. That creates the ability for the spine to be straight, but in the supine position (lying down), you have the chance of going to sleep, so it's not optimal. The optimal is being alert, aware and awake and sitting in a cross-legged position or a straight back chair with your feet flat on the ground. 

That's the best way for it. I believe the Hindus like to have a woolen rug to sit on with our feet on the rug, because it insulates us from the magnetic fields of the Earth (4/ 2021). 

**Why do I always fall asleep when I start to meditate? Is it normal that it happens to people when they start meditation?** 

It's quite a personal question, but one that could refer to anybody. Basically, people fall asleep when they are tired or when they try to meditate lying down. When we lie down, we go into a sleep mode. Meditating whilst lying down is very difficult and we do invariably go to sleep. But if we want to meditate properly, we must be refreshed, we must be rested and be sharp of mind, so we can focus on the meditation process. 

If we try to do it after we've done a hard day's work, it's going to be very difficult. If we have a restless sleep, it's going to be difficult. We need to be awake and alert in terms of ability to focus on our meditation technique. If you're falling asleep, it's either that you're trying to meditate lying down or in too comfortable a chair (is there such a thing?) or you're not rested enough (7/ 2020). 

**What can parents with small children do for spiritual advancement? At the end of the day even, if we try meditation, it won't go as planned?** 

Basically, small children need to be attended to on a regular basis. The only way to move forwards is to try to share the process of entertaining the children. When one of you is entertaining the children, the other one can go and do the meditation. Then that duty can be swapped, so you take turns. That's the best way to do it when you're with children (7/ 2020). 

**My friends are struggling with the drop in frequencies this year. One of them has meditated for years, but feels dragged down during meditation. We are talking about forming a group to meditate together. What are some tips on how to have a successful group meditation?** 

Yes, it's gone down a lot this year (2019), much further than I expected. I expected it to turn around and it still hasn't. I can see the bottom, but we're going to be into next year now. That's because we are helping to accelerate the drop and the depth of dropping. You can see what's going on all over the Earth, so just think positive. 

The first thing is to get together. When you can share what you're experiencing, you know what's happening, because somebody has told you, for instance, myself or any other individual who's sensitive enough to tell that the frequencies are dropping. 

That's affecting everybody. Nobody is exempt, it affects everybody. The way to counteract it is to get together those of like mind and keep good company. Even Paramahansa Yogananda used to say this— keep good company, surround yourselves with like minded people. 

That's what negative people do. They maintain their negativity by surrounding themselves by like minded negative people. You can counteract that by surrounding yourselves with like minded positive people and create an environment where you meditate together. I would suggest that you create a focus for that meditation. 

Rather than just meditating in a blank way and in a neutral way, if you want to meditate on invigorating the individuals within the group, meditate on pulling energy from Source into the group and distributing that energy from Source into the individuals within the group. That will help boost your energies, as will opening your chakras every day by either all together as one or individually one after each other. 

It also helps you to create a focus on higher frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions by exposing your gross physical aspect and your sentience to higher frequencies above and beyond those of the gross physical as well. 

You can also focus on providing higher frequencies or healing for different environments or people. That helps as well. Every time you think about or work with anything that's higher frequency, know that you're making a difference. Know that you're contributing towards the work that Source wants us to do, which is to look after ourselves, look after our environment and perpetuate the environment for other souls or aspects who are going to incarnate later. 

Another thing a group can do is sit and chant “Om” for 20-30 minutes. Just go, “Oooommmm, Oooommmm.” If you stagger the end of the Om, so that each of you is drawing a breath at a different time, then the base resonant frequency of the multiverse, which is Om permeates all of Source and all of us and then all of Origin is being maintained. 

If you're all breathing and chanting Om together, you stop. What you should do is individualize your Om, so that it's always Om being broadcast via the vocal cords. That way, if you all breathe at different times, then Om is always there. That's another excellent way of sending energy out and building your own energies up (10/ 2019). 

**Would you share some techniques to more efficient meditations to shut out stray thoughts?** 

Firstly, if you've got any work to plan for, plan for it, write it down and then forget it, so you can concentrate your time simply on meditating. Make sure you don't have a shopping list of jobs to do. Secondly, the tried and tested method of using mantras works really well. For instance, with the Self-Realization Fellowship uses “hong-sau.” You don't say it verbally, you mentally chant it. When you breathe in, mentally chant hong, like hoooooong. When you breathe out, mentally say sau, like saaaaaaw. You correlate these mental chants with your natural breathing. 

This gives you focus. The chanting of the hong-sau is a way of saying: I'm one with the Source, the Source is one with me, I am the Source or God and I are one. Also concentrate on breathing coming into the lungs and going out of the lungs is also another way of focusing your attention. Concentrate on something, try to perfect it and that focuses your concentration and stops stray thoughts coming in (11/ 2020). 

**When I am doing meditations, I often feel tiny sparks or hear small popping sounds like soda bubbles in my aura. What are they and why do they make sounds?**

Basically, you're hearing the energy. You're starting to move up the frequencies when meditating. You're starting to feel and hear the movement of energy. There's nothing wrong with that. That’s fine, but don’t rely on that as being a prerequisite for achieving a certain level of meditation or a certain level of enlightenment. Move beyond it. Just notice it as a certain milestone on a certain level of frequential level you're achieving through meditation. 

Some people feel tingling in the spine or kundalini energy moving up and down the spine. Some people feel temperature changes. Some people feel as if they've moved totally out of the body. All these different things are just milestones on the way to entering into “samadhi” or transcendental meditation in which one transcends the human form to be in a state of connectivity or communion with the greater reality (11/ 2020). 

**Can you offer exercises for our third eye that help to align it beyond the current images and structures? What actions or exercises (not just meditation) can you offer?** 

It's about meditation. Meditation provides a gateway to a lot of different things. If you want to perceive what is beyond the gross physical frequencies, the thing is to meditate on the third eye. What we do is we close the eyes, we have our back straight and our feet flat on the ground and our hands palm upright on our thighs. Then we gently focus our closed eye vision on the point between the two eyebrows and above the bridge of the nose. That is the location of the spiritual or third eye. 

It's also the location of the spiritual or third eye chakra. But the two are separate things and they are totally independent in function to each other as well. The idea is that you maintain this closed eye stare into this area of blackness or moving colors, depending upon what the ambient light is outside or how you're feeling. You simply breathe, feel your breathing going in and out whilst maintaining this gentle focus. 

Eventually, you may start to see a white spot appear in the area of the third eye. That white spot will move around and you'll find it's difficult to maintain, to keep control of. Sometimes we can lean on our elbows, put our thumb into the tragus of our ear to block our ears off from noise. Put our little finger into the corner of our eye and the remaining three fingers on our temple and that locks the eye in the ocular socket on one side. 

Do the same thing on the other side. So you've got your thumbs blocking your ears off, your little finger in the corner of your eye— obviously, you've got to be careful how you do this— to lock the eye in the ocular socket. The other three fingers are on top of or in the area of the left and right temples. Use that as a way or means of focusing your vision and also controlling this white dot, which will appear. 

Eventually, this white dot is surrounded by a "purpley" color and around that is like a "goldy" color. As you get more control over this white dot, you'll start to see it has form and the form is star shaped, rather like the Star of David. When you continue to focus on that and you need to make it stay in one place, you can start to move towards it eventually. 

This could take weeks, months or years depending upon how dedicated and how much concentration you've got. Then eventually, you can start to move through this third eye, this star-shaped visualization or image within your closed eye vision. Once you've done that, then you start to move into different frequencies. That's another way of moving the consciousness out of the body. When you do that, you start to see things in the different frequencies. 

Initially, it might be the fourth frequency, but then you can start to work out how to navigate to the fifth, sixth and seventh levels. Do the exercise to lock the eye in the ocular socket, then focus, breathe naturally, do “hong-sau” until you see the little white dot. Then start to control this dot until you can hold it in one place. Then you can start to move towards it and it starts to have colors change around it. Then you'll start to have focus, have structure and you can move through structure. 

That's one way of doing it. Another way to do it is the Traversing The Frequencies correspondence course or workshop where I teach people how to do this without using the spiritual/ third eye as the gateway (2/ 2021). 

**Meditation is part of my life now. I noticed it’s best to meditate in nature barefoot on the ground, but not in the winter. The coldness distracts my focus. Is there anything we can do with indoor meditation to have an equal result as meditating in nature?** 

Well, if you haven’t learned how to melt the ice around your meat around you, which is what good Tibetan monks and Zen monks are able to do, I can understand why it’s cold. Anything that distracts your focus is detrimental to meditation. It’s best to keep yourself comfortable without a doubt, because being uncomfortable, in pain or when the environment is too cold or too extreme does cause a problem in being able to focus. 

One of the ways in which you can effect a really good meditation is to sit in a straight back chair or in a lotus position or you can kneel in the way that Zen Buddhist monks do when meditating. Position yourself facing the east, so you’re getting the energies. 

The energies move over the Earth based on the way the Sun rises and falls. It rises in the east and sets in the west. The cosmic energies that are associated with the Sun fall across the Earth coming from the east onwards. If you can meditate at one of the cardinal points: 6 in the morning, 12 noon, 6 at night, midnight, you get more energy coming in through that way. 

Another way is to isolate yourself from the Earth, from the energies associated with the location or environment you’re in. The way to do that is to get a woolen blanket of pure wool and drape it over the chair and also have some part of it on the floor where your feet are going to be and that will insulate you. That creates a condition where you are not influenced by the environment around you, for instance, the house and the energies associated with the house. 

It brings you back to a neutral condition like that which you experience when meditating outside in a woodland area or a grassy area in a park. The other thing is to have a number of different house plants around you as well. If you have any cleansing crystals, you can also place those at one of each corners of the room or place them around you, as in in each corner for a square, for instance. That will help you as well. 

If they’re silicon crystals, you can use your intention to clear them or put them in a solution of salty water. The cleansing is better achieved by having the crystal in the salty water on a full moon with the energies of the moon also bathing the stone. That really cleans it off. 

Then you can hold it in your hand and use your intention for that stone to provide a link with the Earth energy, the energy of nature. When you’re meditating, it will project or maintain a bubble of energy for you that is part of the natural energy around that isn’t affected or interacting or interfered with by man. Try to use these things and that will help a lot (1/ 2019). 

**Do you advocate taking any drugs along with meditation or other practices to awaken? Some Buddhist geeks seem to advocate drugs along with mindfulness meditation?**

No, I’ve never had the desire. When I was about 20, I went on a cycle touring holiday in France. In a youth hostel, I met somebody who had some marijuana. He passed his joints around and I did inhale and it was horrible. Apart from that, it didn’t do anything for me. I wasn’t interested either. 

I’ve always had an innate feeling that we can do what we want to do by pure meditation. I don’t advocate it. I know others do and I don’t mind people doing it. What people want to do is up to them. 

I did smoke as a young lad back in England. We all went through the school boy phase of smoking. I very quickly got out of that as well, so I never found it attractive. I don’t advocate it. I don’t think it’s appropriate, it’s unnecessary. It’s a mechanical short cut, which ultimately results in us struggling to do it properly. 

If people want to go down that route, they can do, if they feel they’re getting an appropriate level of response in terms of their journey. But I would say it does stop you from progressing, because it’s basically a physical tool to try to achieve a metaphysical response (5/ 2015). 

**Some people use spirituality for political gain. They discuss awakening with ayahuasca to get support from voters. Are they helping or distracting us with political gamesmanship?** 

Yes, some people may well have taken ayahuasca. I don't condone taking of ayahuasca, because it's a mechanical way of achieving very transient connectivity with the greater reality. That includes things like cocaine and LSD and all these sorts of things. 

Timothy Leary in the old days said, “Turn on, tune in, drop out.” It was all to do with being connected and using drugs as a mechanical aid. The problem is it's unsustainable and it ultimately damages not only the gross physical aspect of our incarnate vehicle, but it also can damage the frequencies associated with the aspect or soul as well. 

Aligning oneself to a particular sect or individuals who believe or experientially know about spirituality and the greater reality in some way, shape or form and saying, “Oh, I've done this and I know a bit more about that, so you can follow me” is not new. In India you'll see absolutely massive posters of the local politicians with pictures of Krishna, Babaji, Ganesh, etc., to suggest that they are working with these gods or gurus and should be trusted as a result of it, which is completely nonsense. 

They try to get the spiritual vote, but all they are is being very materialistic individuals. Use your intuition to understand when somebody says they are spiritual, but are actually using it for political gain. It can be a bit of a con or it can be real (12/ 2020). 

**How should one pray? Who are we praying to? I don’t believe Source elects to answer or not answer prayers. Can prayer alter the outcome for one’s self or for another?** 

Prayer is a method of trying to align one’s thought processes into a single focus. It’s a very “kindergarten way” of achieving meditation, if you like. When we pray, it’s used as a more structured or more amorphous series of words to create the focus, such as the Lord’s Prayer or other prayers that we create ourselves. 

If they are more repetitive, they could be classified as a mantra. What we’re doing is we’re creating something, which allows us to shut ourselves out from the outside world and focus on what we are trying to achieve in terms of a meditative state or a level of connection or communion with our environment. 

Source may well, if it desired, answer our prayers. Or maybe we would enter our own prayers by creating the energy supporting the desire of those prayers, because prayers can also be used as a mantra to create levels of abundance or levels of outcomes we want. We can work on those and the outcomes are usually dependent upon the individual praying, because the prayer again is the focus. 

If we work on those prayers often enough in a dedicated way, then we will ultimately find that the request of the prayers will come into fruition. It’s really about aligning ourselves to the energies supporting that which we desire. Remember the process is described in The Anne Dialogues: Initial Desire— Modified Desire— Final Desire— Intention (to create the desire)— Thought (on how to create the intended desire)— Action (the creation or manifestation of the intended desire). 

A better way of saying it is to have our desire backing up the intention, which backs up the thought, and therefore, backs up the action. That is the creation behind abundance or any form of development, which we want to invoke into the environment we’re in (7/ 2016). 

**Can we cause a desired outcome to occur for someone else by sending them energy?** 

Yes, to make sure that works properly is to meditate on them and gain energetic concurrence that what we’re asking for them is what they desire or is part of their life plan. We have to work on that. We can do what we want for them. If we feel good about giving them energy, irrespective of whether they take that energy on board and work with it, it doesn’t matter. We’ve given them good energy and good thought processes and we’re thinking well of them (7/ 2016). 

**Is it proper to ask for help? How? Can we ask for help from the Council of Twelve?** 

We can always call on the Source Entity. We’re all connected to the Source Entity, because we’re all smaller subsets of individualization of sentient energy from the Source. You can also meditate on gaining help via the True Energetic Self (Higher Self, Oversoul, Godhead) for generalized help in guidance or things that would help us make better decisions. 

My understanding is that the Council of Twelve are more involved with the governance of the multiversal environment. Each council is involved in a particular frequency within the physical universe, so they would not be interacting with us. They aren’t involved with what we’re doing, because they have other roles to play. They are part of this set of entities described in the book, The Curators (7/ 2018). 

**To raise the frequency of our brothers and sisters, perhaps we could commune with The Source/ God at a specific time— to get world leaders to follow the Golden Rule, be kind to our neighbors, assist others in need, bless the food, the Earth and the caretakers?** 

Any of those is very good, but there’s no need to separate them out. Everything that’s been talked about being mindful or mindfulness— the Buddhists are very good at pointing out how to be mindful, how to respect the planet, how to respect each other, the environment, the animals, the insects and the plants that give us the ability to exist here in our incarnate state. So giving thanks is one way of doing it. Being mindful of everything is one way of looking at it as well. 

You don’t have to do anything major. You just have to simply sit and meditate and be grateful for the opportunity of being here on this planet, incarnate in the body that you’ve incarnated into with individualized free will and being able to interact with the environment, other individuals who are of a like mind. 

Sometimes you affect the thought processes of others who previously were immersed in their incarnation and now start to show signs of opening up and becoming more expansive, more aware and awake. That’s enough. 

Simply being grateful to the plants or the animals that you’re using for food for providing that food is enough. Being grateful for the individuals around you who you work with, interact with is another way of doing it. Meditating is another way. Collectively meditating on raising the frequencies of our political leaders is one way of doing it. 

All of those things would work. When we start to do that, a number of others start to do it. We start to create a triangulation effect— both directional and inflational triangulation, so those individuals who moved down the frequencies will start to move up the frequencies again (8/ 2018). 

**How do you manage to provide such wonderful meditations every month for us? This is a huge task! Thank you very much for your unconditional love.** 

Thank you. Well, actually, it is given to me. I sit after every lecture and set of questions and then for the end of meet meditation, I sit and meditate on what I've given. I ask to be given what the next subject is— both the lecture and the end of meet meditation. I'm given it, so I don't create it, I don't invent it. I don't think of it, I don't work it out. I don't try to relate it to what I've done before. Source simply says, “You should work on this” and that's what I give. 

In terms of the questions, the answers to the questions are mostly channeled information. If the questions are based upon a subject that I know and can remember— because you could imagine the amount of information I pick up, so it's difficult to remember it all— then I can answer it straightaway. 

But usually the information is channeled through. Although it seems like I'm just answering the question, the information is actually coming into me from different directions. Hopefully, I'm able to answer the questions in a way, which is meaningful to the questioner. At the end of all of these things, I sit down and meditate for some time just to sort of absorb what's come through me and what needs to be dealt with in the next Satsanga (11/ 2019). 

**One of my friends cannot quite put himself together these days. So many things are happening all at once and he cannot keep up. Do you have any advice?** 

Basically, protect yourselves. You can use the Psychic Shield and program it, so you are keeping yourself in a higher frequency bubble. When we're in higher frequency, we can do multitasking on a completely different level. We can work in a way, which is really efficient, fast and right first time. But when we move down, this is what happens. We can't get our self together. We can't multitask, we can only do one thing at a time. That which we used to be able to do in a higher frequency way becomes difficult to impossible, when we're in a low frequency environment. 

Create the Psychic Shield and use it to maintain your high frequencies in a high level. Write down what your spiritual desires are and work on those. Keep doing meditation. Keep being of service to others when requested, as long as you're not abused or taken advantage of. Keep recognizing what's right and what's obviously not right, what's the best way to do things. 

For instance, if you see litter in the street, pick it up and put it in a bin. Keep doing these positive, higher frequency things and you'll find that getting ourselves together again will become second nature. Notice that it's much easier to drop down the frequencies than it is to rise up again. It is really easy to drop down the frequencies. You don't have to do anything, it's like going downstream with the flow of a river. But it is really hard to rise up the frequencies or swim up river. That's a good way to think about it (8/ 2020). 

**Are 24/ 7 full-time professional meditators connected with the Source Entity and the Origin? Or just the SE?** 

There's not many that would be in contact with the Origin, because of their own limitations. As Roy Eugene Davis (Paramahansa Yogananda; As I Knew Him) once asked his teacher back in the late 1940s to 1950s, how many people have gone beyond God? 

Yogananda said not many. They get infatuated with God and don't move beyond God to that which is beyond God— the All There Is. The All There Is or the Absolute, as the Hindus call it, is the Origin. You can probably say that there's a significant number less than 1% that are in contact with the Origin. But a lot are in contact with the Source or God (3/ 2021). 

**How come we don't hear about the Origin from others besides you? Are others referring to the Origin by different names?** 

The Hindu yogis understood that the Origin is that which is beyond God. They do talk about it. When I first started to be in contact with the Origin, I didn't know at all that there was a limited number of individuals who know about the Origin. I only found out later when I opened a random page in a very ancient book given to me by my Aikido student. That book was published by a yogi who lived in Chicago back in the early 1900s. 

He mentioned the Origin but called it the “Absolute.” It was much, much later when reading the Autobiography of a Yogi that I realized that the Origin was the same thing as the Absolute. It’s individuals who are expansive enough to be able to recognize that there is another much, much larger level of sentience above the Source Entities. It’s the Absolute, All There Is or that which is beyond God or the Origin (3/ 2021). 

**What are the key factors to establish a stable connection with the Origin? How can we maintain it?** 

Learn to have constant communication the Source Entity first and then ask for its assistance in connecting with the Origin. Connecting with the Source Entity is a significant achievement— a very significant achievement whilst incarnate. It's not something that everybody does. 

There are many who seek it, but sometimes their own desire creates a blockage. My advice is do your best to meditate. Do your best to disassociate yourself from the gross physical and in doing so, enlist the help of the Source. When you're competent in your connectivity with the Source and you can turn it on and off when required or at will, then you can ask Source to help you in working with the connection required to contact the Origin. That's basically it (3/ 2021). 

**How many people on the current Earth are consciously in communion with the Source?** 

ased upon a population of 7.8 billion people, I’m seeing that it's just a few thousand, not even that maybe. Not even individuals who are yogis are in contact with the Source. Not even yogis that have been meditating hard and diligently for 30 or 40 years, they can't contact the Source— maybe because they're doing something wrong? Some individuals can be in contact with it instantaneously. Others may take a bit longer. But in general, it takes dedication and complete open mindedness (3/ 2021). 

**How many are consciously in communion with the Origin?** 

I'm being told less than a hundred. That’s quite a lot of people who are not in contact (3/ 2021). 

**Is it a bit easier to be one with the Source and the Origin, if one has certain percentage of “Om-ness” associated with him/ her?** 

I'm being told no, it's just a function of our dedication irrespective of whether you're a hybrid Om, a full Om, a captive Om or a noncaptive Om. It's immaterial. When you are incarnate, you are subject to the vagaries of the lower frequencies and you have to work with this. 

If you look at all of the different spiritual leaders around the world over the century, it's certain they all have their own problems with this particular low frequency environment. My understanding is and what I've just been told is that it's not easier at all. It's just that we have a different energy set and a different quality of sentience. But whilst here, we have to obey the same physical rules as everybody else (4/ 2021). 

**When I meditate, I feel like I am elevating the frequencies around me. Are we able to affect our environment positively, if we meditate regularly?** 

Yes, we do change our frequencies when we meditate. The inner changes in frequency could be felt as heat or tingling or pressure around the spiritual or third eye area or the base of the skull. It's because your physical body is straining to keep up with where your sentience is going. 

But the frequencies around us are also affected as well. Think of it like a heater or a light bulb. The function of a light bulb is to create light, but the byproduct is heat. When we are elevating our frequencies or projecting our consciousness to a higher level of frequency, the result is that there's also a waste product. 

That waste product is that we inflate or raise the frequencies around us. That means we also help the environment by allowing the environment to become a higher level of frequency by meditating. Meditation does absolutely raise one's frequencies (4/ 2021). 

**Do the qualities and effectiveness to the surrounding environment change when we are contacting and/ or in communion with higher beings and entities, such as the Om, Source and the Origin while meditating? If so, how?** 

Anyone who is meditating creates a positive effect, because we are increasing our frequency around us. When we have contact with other entities, such as the Om, other disincarnate or incarnate entities that are higher frequency or we talk to the Source Entity or the Origin, we are creating a condition where we are lifting our frequencies and those around us are affected by it. 

When they are affected by it, they start to change the way they think, behave and act to a positive way, because they start to see how stupid things are, how kindergarten our thought processes are, how ridiculous the way we respond to people is. 

When we're angry at somebody, why are we angry? We don't know why we're angry, we just know we're angry or they've annoyed us in some way. When we're higher frequency, we can see what's made us angry and what makes them angry. We can see that we're just entities in incarnate vehicles doing the best we can to experience, learn and evolve. It affects us and the people around us. 

It affects the environment positively. If you meditate to higher entities and you're meditating around trees, plants or any sort of flora and fauna, which is natural, you'll notice that they start to glow as well. They benefit from the higher frequencies. They love it (4/ 2021). 

**How does our Source feel when human incarnates manage to contact it? How about the Om and the Origin?** 

The Om are a bit aloof, a bit distanced. They like to keep aloof. There are not many of them that like to incarnate, so they like to keep away from incarnation, because it creates karma. It also creates responsibility. They tend to keep away, but those who have contacted the Om will be pleased that the Om are pleased to meet them. 

So is the Origin and so is the Source Entity. It's very rare that an incarnate entity will be in contact with the Origin or even the Om. It’s more likely to be the Source Entity, because that's where our sentience is individualized from. 

But Source is delighted when an incarnate aspect of itself manages to rise above the frequencies and return to it, even though it's temporarily maybe in meditation to communicate with it or be in communion with it. It's delighted by that. It's in joy. 

We are also in that joy, so we get the bliss state associated with it. Transcendental meditation or “samadhi,” as the Hindus call it, usually results in a large smile on one's face and that's because we are in joy. We're enjoying being in communion. The Source is enjoying a smaller aspect of itself being in communion with it as well (4/ 2021). 

**Why do we need to ask for Source’s assistance to establish connection with the Origin, if we are all part of and are the Origin?** 

It's simply a function of needing help to be elevated. When we fly, we need help. We need the help of a vehicle like an airplane or a balloon, for example. We seek the assistance of something that can do something that we can't do. If we ask for help to communicate with the Origin, the Source is giving us a boost. It's accelerating our opportunity to be at a higher frequential level to allow the Origin to communicate with us and to allow us to communicate with the Origin. 

We have to move to a point where we are equal with the Source Entity, so that it and we can communicate with the Origin. It's a bit like standing on top of a mountain, so you can see as far as you can. You can only see the whole landscape and the curvature of the Earth from a very high position. 

You can't do it from being on the floor or certainly if you're in a city where we have city canyons. You can't see above those canyons unless you go to the top of those buildings. Being on top of one of the buildings is like asking the Source to help us. We need to be elevated to a point, where we can see more and communicate more (4/ 2021). 

**How can we tell if we are communicating with the Origin and not other beings or entities or our ego?** 

You know. You definitely know. It's something quite profound. When we're communicating with astral entities or incarnate entities at a higher frequency, you feel as if you're on the same level as them. You feel as if they are simply brothers or sisters to use a human term. 

But when you're communicating with the Origin or the Source, it's like being exposed to the biggest level of communion that you've ever had. Your expansion is indescribable, so you know. I can't describe it. You can't describe it in human terms, but you know when you are in communication or in communion with them (4/ 2021). 

**If Pure Om can move around different Source Entities, then they do not have the sense of belonging to specific SE?** 

That's right. The Om aren't specifically aligned. Pure Om or noncaptive Om aren't aligned to a Source Entity. It's only those that are of a lower level of quality of sentience who become captive Om or hybrid Om that are associated with a Source Entity. Some of them may decide to be associated with a Source Entity, but that tends to be on a temporary basis to suit themselves. It's something that they do, but they don't need to be associated with a Source Entity. They belong to themselves. They are beloved of the Om. They're not beloved of the Source Entity (4/ 2021). 

**Is your Pure Om originated from our Source Entity or from a different SE?** 

My understanding is that I'm one of those Om that are not specifically from a Source Entity. I don't know or I'm not allowed to know why I associated with this particular Source Entity— other than maybe because it's got the most diverse interpretation of the decree from the Origin to experience, learn and evolve in as many different ways as possible. 

It has a really unique and diverse and "multipolous" way of experiencing itself and its environment through us. As far as I'm aware, there isn't anything like the type of multiversal environment created from its own structure that is reproduced in any of the other Source Entities. 

For me, it feels very much like I chose this Source Entity or my True Energetic Self or the other Om who's looking after me, like Hum, because it looks after me every now and then. With Anne as well, we looked after each other while we're here and she's still looking after me here. 

We just decided that it would be interesting to do what those individualizations of sentience from a Source Entity are experiencing, just as an experience. So I'm not from any particular Source Entity, although at the moment I'm aligning myself temporarily with this Source Entity (4/ 2021). 

**If the energetic signature of the Om and the Origin are the same, how can we (non-Om) identify which one is which?** 

I'm just going to ask the question. It's about the quality of sentience. The quality of sentience with the Origin is vastly bigger in terms of volume than the quality of sentience with the Om simply because they are much smaller individualized units of Origin sentience and energy who have got their own individuality in terms of their own ability to move around and do what they need to do, whereas the Origin is everything. So the sheer volume of the quality of sentience associated with the Origin is how you could tell. 

It's a bit like going into a greenhouse and then going into a nursery where there's huge, field-sized greenhouses, just to give you an example. When you're in a greenhouse, you know it's full of glass and it's for growing flowers. But if you go into a nursery, you go into a huge greenhouse, which can be a hundred meters long and all joined together, so it can be a 100 meters square. It's the same thing, but it's much bigger. 

You would feel the enormity of the Origin in comparison to the minority of the Om from that perspective. But you know it's the same thing. They're both greenhouses, but one is a bigger greenhouse than the other. That's the way to identify it. You would intuitively know (4/ 2021). 

**What looks like events happening out there is actually us moving from one event to another event in Event Space?** 

Correct. What I’ve been doing recently with the Traversing The Frequencies (TTF) Level 3 students in meditation is teaching them how to move around the multiverse whilst keeping their eyes closed and other exercises as well. 

When we move around event space, sometimes we may get the impression or feel like we’re moving in different angles up and down, left and right. Sometimes we feel like the multiverse is moving around us, so we’re static and the multiverse is moving around us and then presenting to us the environment we’re going to travel to (3/ 2015). 

**Which is it— us moving or the multiverse moving?** 

Both. You will find that when you’re moving around the multiverse fast, you will experience various different inertial things— like your body is moving from left to right or up and down, like you might be going in a spiral or going up and down a hill or banking left and right on the plane, for instance. 

But some of us do feel that the multiverse rotates around us and that we are static and all of the zodiacs and all of the galaxies move around us and the planets that we are supposed to be working with come into sharper view. We can literally step from one place to another place as a result of it (3/ 2015). 

**Does that mean we are in the center of it all?** 

The answer that I’ve just been given is no, it’s not. We’re not at the center of it all. However, we can create an individual environment, which will allow us to be at the center of it all. If you think about it, when we anchor ourselves to the Earth, we stay on the Earth, don’t we? 

Everything does move and we do move around, but within the constraints of how long this road goes into. We are also able to move around the multiverse and/ or we can move the multiverse around us, because we are master creators, master beings. We are literally smaller individualized units of our Source Entity. Therefore, there’s lots of functionality that we have that we don’t particularly recognize, because we haven’t exposed ourselves to it and used it (3/ 2015). 

**Is FB 204 a point of singularity in our multiverse with 408 frequencies?** 

It’s a juncture or what I call a linchpin where all the event spaces and frequencies associated with the multiverse converge at one point. It’s the center of interconnectedness, which is being explored in the meditation given this month (3/ 2015). 

**During meditation the “point of consciousness” is when we reach blackness, no gravity, complete silence and love. One can engage in remote viewing or healing, etc. During Traversing The Frequencies work, at what frequency is the point of consciousness reached?** 

The Traversing The Frequencies (TTF) work is where you can get to this point, any point with TTF, once you've moved out of the gross physical and the spirituo-physical levels. That would be when you move above the 12th frequency, because then you're outside of the energies associated with the incarnate human vehicle. 

When you've moved above the 12th to the 13th frequency (FB 13), you're within the second full dimension and you start to move into different levels of consciousness and connectivity then. Although moving even into the fourth frequency (FB 4) increases your level of connectivity, the higher up the frequencies you go and the more you disassociate yourself from the gross physical or physical universe, the more enhanced that level of connectivity and clairsentience (knowingness) becomes (1/ 2020). 

**Could you elaborate about the gaps between frequencies and the overlaps between frequencies in TTF? Could we see past and future events happening when we travel through the gaps? Are the Akashic records in the gaps between frequencies?** 

Basically, the gaps in between the frequencies are a function of substructure, which are part of the basic structure of the Source, which comes from the Origin’s structure. There's substructure within everything really. That substructure is what is used by the Curators to move around the structure of the multiversal environment, which is part of the Source. These gaps aren't where the Akashic records are. 

The Akashic record is a set of memory function of the Source that specifically focuses on the interactions of incarnate mankind and other human type vehicles in this universe. 

Each species of incarnate vehicle has its own memory set where everything that is experienced and learned by every soul in every body they've been in is recorded in a particular location within the Source. That's a higher function of Source that is outside of the multiverse, but nevertheless accessible, if you have the methodology of doing it. 

The only way to see the events of past, present and future is because we are moving into different event spaces. If you can go into an event space where everything is happening concurrently, i.e. you access all the event spaces concurrently, then you can choose to see everything concurrently, which in my experience creates a white wall or the white screen, because everything is happening too quickly. 

You can't experience everything concurrently whilst in this incarnate state. We simply don't have the capacity until we're disincarnate. Or you can simply isolate an event that is classified as being "future" from our perspective. Don't forget there is no such thing as past, present and future, there's only Now (see “Time”). 

That Nowness can be experienced concurrently with every other Nowness. What happens is we've got this capability of isolating an event space from another, should we decide to do so, should we interact with event space in a robust and repeatable and knowledgeable way (1/ 2020).

### 冥想

### Metaphysical Teachings 

**In The History of God you identified three religions and the people who brought them: Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha. You did not mention Moses and Judaism. Why not?**

I’m being told it wasn’t significant in terms of a belief system. It wasn’t based upon helping individuals understand the truth of who and what we are and how to contact who and what we are in the same way that the religions that were generated from the original teachings of Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha did. That’s the only reason. 

It was a bit loose and it became changed by mankind very quickly and so did Christianity, Buddhism and Islam. But the essence of what it was originally wasn’t as strong as the others, so these three are the more dominant ones. 

There is a book I’m going to write at some point, which looks at religions and their origin points. It looks at the commonalities with my work and where they help to illustrate the psycho-spiritual aspects and the spiritual physics surrounding them. It also looks at the ability to use them as a means to become self-aware and self-realized, to be in robust communicative connection with our Source or our True Energetic Self. 

I’ll address all of these different religions in that book to see where they are. We’ll see more detail about Judaism or what impact it had. But it didn’t have the same impact as the others. Some people would argue that it had an impact from the human perspective. But in terms of the human being able to communicate with themselves, their Higher Self and Source, it’s a different thing altogether (4/ 2019). 

**So much is attached to Judaism and hidden meanings to our creation through many books and movies as to “I am that I am” when Moses received a response from God. What is the proper format for using that phrase? What is your take on this?** 

If you say “I am that I am” or “I think therefore I am” is another way of thinking it, it’s loose. Although there’s some hidden meanings there, the meanings aren’t focused enough. There are problems with all religious books, including the Bible (from the Greek word “biblio” for book). Even the Bible was written 300 years or so after the time of Christ, and therefore, it has a number of different errors and personal desires of the author constructed within it. 

If we can’t remember what we did a week ago, let alone a month ago, let alone two days ago with any accuracy, then how can we translate what happened 300 years ago in any real and robust way even though there may have been texts created by the Apostles. It’s difficult to understand how books can really be as accurate as possible in this instance, when they’re trying to portray something that is not transcribable at that time. 

Interpretation is a low education way of trying to say that “I am that I am” or I am God. We’re all God. We’re all smaller individualized aspects of God. I feel it was trying to explain that. Because the educational levels, the ability to expand and understand things was significantly lower in those times, the way in which things had to be described wasn’t accurate or focused enough to be able to stand the test of time, to be meaningful or even to be broadcast accurately from one generation to another generation. 

The proper format would be I am God and you are God or you are Source, we are all Source. We’re all smaller individualized units of Source. Even now that is difficult for people to take or understand, so even now that is a poor way of describing it. Although it makes sense to us now with our level of education and expansivity, in another time or more progressive state, that’s a poor descriptor as well. 

It’s all to do with describing the “I am that I am” as I am energy, I am sentience. But how do you describe sentience to somebody who didn’t understand the word “sentience” in the past? So “I am” simply means I exist. I am everywhere. There’s a lot more to it than meets the eye here, but it’s a way of describing that sentience exists and it is not contained within a physical form. That’s another way of saying it as well (4/ 2019). 

There’s a question here, which I think we’ve answered before. But I think I’m going to answer it again. If Source said “I am that I am,” it’s basically saying I am Source. I am existent, I am in existence. I am sentience. “I think therefore I am” is a very good way of saying it as well. 

Some of these books, although they don’t give us directions, they do give us an understanding of in a very, very basic way that we are sentience and energy. We as individuals can reconnect with Source or reconnect with our True Energetic Selves, which are sentience and energy. It’s just that the volume or density of sentience and energy is much greater, as we move up. 

The sentience associated with an incarnate aspect or soul is about 2.5% of the sentience of a True Energetic Self, so we can see there’s a great jump in sentience associated with the TES. If we look at the difference in the percentage of sentience that a True Energetic Self has in comparison to Source and between the Source Entities and the Origin, you can see a massive jump again. 

It’s just showing that we are smaller individualized units of Source. The Sources are smaller individualized units of the Origin. The Om beings are smaller individualized units of Origin and the hybrid Om are a mixture of Origin energy and Source energy. 

This is to recognize that we are not the human form and our creator is not quantifiable as being physical or human. So “I am that I am” or “I think therefore I am” is an indication that we are the sentience, not the form (5/ 2019). 

**The Bible introduces God as “Elohim” or a group or a council of beings. Then it singles out the Jehovah Elohim. The Bible has different names for one God (e.g. Jehovah, Adonai, El, El-Elyon, El-Shaddai). Are these titles for one being or are these separate beings?** 

My understanding is the twelve Source Entities are what should be termed as the Elohim. Each of the Source Entities is created by the Origin, so they are the co-creators that are the Elohim. It’s to do with understanding the meaning behind what was being broadcast to individuals of a certain level of education and intelligence. 

Not to be derogatory, but if we’re only working with 18th century technology, how can we explain a computer to somebody? How could we explain an airplane to somebody in the 15th century? You have to think of it in these ways. 

Sometimes the Source Entities were given names, if that information was being taught to people to help them understand. We understand the words Source Entity One, Two, Three, Four to Twelve now, because it’s a logical progression. But that is only there as a function of the order in which I managed to contact them. It has no other weight than that. 

So if the Source Entities decided to give themselves names in English or whatever language (which is highly unlikely), then would they give themselves those names. Or were those names given to them in the old days by those who were able to communicate with them? 

My understanding is that it’s probably just a way of demarcating the different Source Entities based upon the time frame (event space) in which that information was being broadcast. Each of the Elohim would be one of the Source Entities. If you think of it in terms of a council, they are a Council of Twelve Source Entities or Twelve Elohim— Elohim being a name for those who are the start of creation based on my understanding (2/ 2019). 

**In the Bible (Book of Daniel), a man clothed in linen was bringing a message from his “Elohim,” but was delayed by the prince of Persia and had to be helped by the chief prince, Michael. Who was the man clothed in linen, the prince of Persia and chief Prince Michael?** 

The Elohim themselves are the other Source Entities in a higher sense. That’s just because they are classified as he highest level of individualization before the Origin. But a lower version of “Elohim” could be our True Sentient Selves, because they also work from the perspective of being our highest level of sentience. 

What I’m picking up is that I’ve got two answers here. The man in linen was somebody who had survived the downfall of Atlantis and was therefore Atlantean. The skin colors are part of a genetic fashion that the Atlanteans had. They were able to manipulate their genome and create things, like hybrids of animals and human bodies and also change the color of their skin (e.g. blue, green, violet). 

That individual was an Atlantean who had stayed behind to help the other souls incarnated on Earth in the post-Atlantean period. There were a number of Atlanteans who were able to live quite a lot longer than the humans at that time. 

The chief prince Michael was one of the maintenance entities (or Curators) that we classify as an angel. Archangel Michael is one of those entities who works on the maintenance of the Earth and this particular environment. You can think of it as an angel or as being angelic, but we also have to think of the level of education that people had in that period. They were taught that something that was bright, energetic and gold-like in appearance was something that was unachievable by humans. That included some of its abilities or functions, such as how to change the environment or disassemble the form that they’ve got. 

So I’m picking up that the Atlantean individual was in communication with this Prince Michael, which was Archangel Michael or one of the maintenance entities working with the Earth and there was some communication there. His “Elohim” were these maintenance entities or the Archangels— chief prince Michael was actually a maintenance entity we call Archangel Michael (3/ 2019). 

**I have a question about Muhammed and the history of Islam. Muhammed ordered to kill many people during his life— for instance, in case of treason, he ordered to kill all men and women of a Jewish tribe. How can we justify his killings and call him a great master?** 

My understanding is that a lot of the work of every spiritual leader was misunderstood by the individuals who were supposed to broadcast it. Much of the information that comes through has either been rewritten based upon the thoughts and desires of an individual to try and redirect the understanding based upon a human condition away from the original teachings of that individual. 

What I'm picking up here is that the order that Mohammed was supposed to have given to kill a number of individuals— men and women of a tribe who just happened to be Jewish— is a misconception based upon the idea of trying to remove their thoughts and trying to give them an alternative understanding of how to become enlightened. If people decided that the best way to remove those thoughts and give them a different way of understanding of how to be connected with the greater environment was to remove their physical bodies, then that was a complete misinterpretation. I can't imagine that an enlightened individual, such as Mohammed, actually ordered that. 

I'm picking up that that isn't the case. It's a story that's been perpetuated based upon the desire of individuals who weren't enlightened, but who were nevertheless using the teachings of Mohammed for their own ends. What I'm very much feeling that look at Islam, look at things like the Koran, the Bible, the Vedas, look at everything that's out there and digest it properly in a neutralized and helicopter view. 

Although the information may be diversified based upon the skill set of individual leaders to gain self-awareness or self-enlightenment in the true sense, in essence what they're experiencing is the same thing. It's just that they found it in a particular individual way. For instance, my way is to use the Traversing The Frequencies. Yogananda's way was to use kriya yoga, because he was taught it by Sri Yukteswar, who was taught it by Lahiri Mahasaya, who was taught it by Babaji. There is a lineage there. 

When we get to higher frequencies, we can use different ways of doing it, because we've got a head start or a springboard to work from. But when we're a lower frequency, sometimes we have lower ways of doing it. For instance, in the old days it took 30 years of dedicated practice for a yogi to achieve self-awareness and self-enlightenment. Now we can get there in a few years, sometimes in a few weeks or a few days (7/ 2019). 

**Do you have any opinion about Gnostic Teachings and Greek myths about the imperfect creator god (demiurge) of this world?** 

First of all, a myth is a shortening of the word “paramythia,” which in Greek is story. So basically it’s a story. Any individual with a higher level of education, higher technology or higher functionality we would classify as being above us or as a “god” even now, but they aren’t god. Having said that, we’re all part of God, because we’re all individualized units of God. 

To say “demiurge” was an imperfect creator is because he’s creating. This doesn’t mean it’s imperfect, it could be perfect. What it’s suggesting is that those classified as being a god or as having higher functionality and being highly evolved can also get affected by the low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions associated with being here. The imperfection is the result of some level of karmic influence— being addicted to or attracted to status, material wealth, being in power, being in control of others. 

It’s all about teaching people that just because you are a higher being doesn’t mean you’re not affected by the lowest frequencies associated with the multiversal environment. Don’t forget that there are many entities who have participated in creating the physical universe and the components of the physical universe. 

So to suggest that one particular individual was involved with the creation of the planet, although they can be, is probably taking it to the point where the education of the individuals at the time couldn’t understand the detail behind it. It’s all about understanding that even those of higher frequency get affected by lower frequencies of the physical universe (6/ 2018). 

**In Hinduism is the belief about three gods (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) true and correct? Who is Lord Shiva? Why he is the destroyer god? If Lord Shiva is a real entity, what is his relation to our Source or other Source Entities?** 

The Hindu “gods” in my understanding are basically those individuals who survived the Atlantean Fall. The different body types, skin colors, etc. were created through a very materialistic desire to be or show one's level of status. Whereas individuals nowadays have motor cars, houses and jewelry to show status, in the Atlantean times they used to change their body type and genome. 

They were given names and god status by other incarnate human beings who saw them as being something above what they were. They still had certain levels of technology. They had levels of knowledge above those who had recently incarnated, so they were given godlike status. 

The “destroyer god” name was given from the perspective that it may have caused part of the downfall, but still come out the other side to help try and recover from the Fall. A lot of the roles that they've been given, a lot of the ways that they've been perceived were based upon what they did, not what they are from a god perspective. They're all part of Source Entity One. They exist within the multiversal environment. Their position within it is a function of their evolutionary status. 

A lot of the images in Hinduism is direct translation, memory or artwork that's been passed on down the eons to show what some of the important or wealthy individuals appeared like when they were helping others, specifically in India or Egypt to recover the incarnate human civilization and try to move forwards in a different way rather than in a corrupt way. I don't know, if that helps, but it's a different way to think about it. 

This is a very strong image of what I've received— a lot of those entities we call "gods" were simply from the Atlantean era or even sometimes beforehand. Bear in mind that people lived a lot longer in those days and they did mess around with the genome quite a lot.

Hence, we see things like centaurs, minotaurs, unicorns and pegasus type imagery along with all the half-man/ half-animal images of individuals or priests ruling or certain levels of hierarchical authority within the Egyptian periods, because it spills over into the Egyptian period as well (2/ 2020). 

**In Hinduism Lord Shiva is called the Absolute who has no beginning and no end. Were the ancient rishis trying to tell us that Shiva is the name given to the Origin?**

There is no name for the Origin. The Origin is just something that I was given to work with. Same with the Source Entities. There is no name for God or that which created us, other than our Creator and our Creator's Creator. Basically, some of these Hindu gods are historic references to those individuals who survived the Atlantean collapse and were recognized as having certain roles within the collapse. 

Shiva was one of them classified as the destroyer and may have had a significant role in the demise of the Atlantean civilization, but then decided that he needed to create some recompense and work on helping the next civilization, which was during the Egyptian period to become more than it was. 

It sort of helped to a certain extent, but right now we are in a slightly confused state, because we're still trying to work with religion and with the spiritual side and with the scientific side of spiritualism as well, which is causing a bit of a confusion with all people. 

We need to move away from religion and just go down to what the hard facts are in the stories within the Vedas, the Bible, the Jewish texts and those that have come from Islam as well. We need to get away from the religion side and look at the absolute detail of what they were trying to teach in the first instance. Then we'll move away from these isolated conditions of understanding and the histories that are written down by individuals, who didn't really understand and had limited levels of education and limited levels of expansivity as well (2/ 2020). 

**What do you think of the “Ra material” channeled by Carla Rueckert? In your view what is the best explanation of metaphysics?** 

That’s a difficult question, because it’s a moving feast. I’m just going to ask the question about the validity of Carla Rueckert and the Ra material. I’m being told that the information is reasonable, but there’s a lot of holes in there. As human beings we tend to try to fill the holes, because we are getting embarrassed, if we’ve got holes there. We like to think we’ve got the answers to everything. This is where the ego sneaks into it. 

Rather than saying that there’s lots of little holes in there, for instance, that this is the technology they had instead of saying that you are making an assumption that this is what is happening. The information is being given in a way that people can understand. It’s the level of detail that is relevant to her level of expansiveness, but it is very holey, so it’s a bit like a sieve with lots of little gaps there. 

I would say that my own material is simply a product of my own level of expansivity. This is the thing with people who channel information. The entities that are working with them can only give you information based upon your level of expansivity and baseline knowledge that you can work with. You tend to find that the information that’s being broadcast— this includes my work— is relevant to the ability for that channeler to broadcast what they’ve experienced. 

There are a number of times when I’ve experienced something personally in the work I’m doing. I may understand it on a really fundamental level, but struggle to put it into words, because there aren’t words to describe it. When I do get words, it is usually just about enough to make it make sense. There are times when I get some good explanations and times when it takes a long time for the information to come out and times when I’ve only got a little shadow of what’s there. 

It just depends upon the detail that’s there and the level of our own vocabulary that we’ve accrued in this particular incarnation. Vocabulary isn’t just the spoken vocabulary, it’s the total vocabulary of our experiences— whether we’ve experienced it through vision, speech, hearing, smell, taste, touch or mental fortitude, mental exercise and conscious exercise. It’s a whole gamut of different things. I would say that this particular piece of information should be used as a broadening exercise to give you an understanding that there are other ways of understanding the details, but those other ways are usually based upon the channeler’s to assimilate that knowledge. 

When you’re reading any information— including my work, Dolores Cannon, Eckhart Tolle, Neale Walsch, Carla Rueckert, Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, all these people out there who are doing lots of excellent work— take the bits and pieces that resonate with you and create your own picture, because your picture will be more complete for you than a bit of a picture from another author. 

Sometimes you just need to take bits and pieces from different authors or from different information sources to get one that works for you based upon your own experiential data set or language set (11/ 2017). 

**The Urantia Book claims Lord Metatron and ETs made contact with a group in Detroit. They said the Great Pyramid was built around 45,600 BC by ET crews from Aldebaran. But in 3000 BC Khufu added the copper capstone and limestone sides. Is any of this true?** 

Certainly, the pyramids were available a long time ago and 45,000 years is a minimum in my understanding. They were generated by the Atlanteans. I’ve not asked whether they were helped by another incarnate race of a similar frequency to that that the Atlantean civilization was whilst on Earth. 

I’m being told that the Atlanteans understood the relationships between geometrics, sacred geometry and the dimensions associated with them and the ability to attract certain energies and harvest those energies. 

They also knew about the existence and communicated with other incarnate civilizations within our galaxy. At times, they requested the use of or the help of the integration of or the installation of certain technologies that they were not so expert in. They traded those technologies for what they knew about crystals and other more natural technologies with these other races. 

My understanding is that all of this was done at the same time, so the limestone sides and the copper top was there in the first place. It’s nothing to do with Khufu, although there was some repair work done by that pharaoh who may have decided to claim the work as his own to perpetuate the typical belief system of the Egyptians that the pharaoh was a god (2/ 2019). 

**The Urantia Book claims twelve Universes is called a Cluster. Twelve Clusters are a Ring and twelve Rings are called a Wheel. Is any of this correct?** 

If you just look at the structure, then it is a way to describe the structure of the multiverse based upon the level of education at that time. In the past I’ve described the structure of the multiverse as a pie chart— split up into thirds where each third is a subdimensional component that has twelve frequencies that correspond to twelve universes. 

But the total number is 397 universes in a 12-dimensional multiverse that has 408 frequencies. My understanding is that the information is corrupted, but is based upon a truth that may have been difficult to digest at the time, and therefore, was simplified in some way. It may have been corrupted with all the other information later. That is a quite difficult concept actually (2/ 2019). 

**Why is the wisdom that you and others bring such a deep dark secret over the centuries? Why do the masses continue to accept limiting religious beliefs or no beliefs at all and ignore the teachings of Jesus, Buddha, etc.? We have come to accept that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but we have made little progress when it comes to knowing who we are.** 

It’s all to do with the evolutionary levels of those individuals who are incarnating. The higher up the frequencies we are, the more open we are to understanding the greater reality. Those who are truth seekers are able to understand and work with these different understandings. 

The vast majority of incarnate individuals are immersed in their incarnation, so they can be attracted to low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions and that is a karmic function. Those who are in a fully immersed incarnation get affected by the ego that develops as a result of being almost totally cut off from our True Energetic Selves. We have almost no communicative ability whilst we are incarnate. 

We create this personality or ego, which is totally associated with the incarnate body making us think that we are the human body. When people are immersed to the point where the ego is the primary method of thinking, experiencing and evolving, then we start to forget who and what we are. We believe that we’re just the human body and we behave in a very selfish fashion as a result. 

That’s why open and expansive thinking is ignored, because it doesn’t help people from a physical perspective. It helps them from a spiritual perspective and the ego can’t really work with that, because it doesn’t benefit it at all. 

When we progress up the frequencies, the ego starts to dissolve, because we start to realize who and what we are. We start to become more expansive. We start to be able to communicate with those individuals on higher frequencies. We start to be able to communicate in a more coherent fashion with our True Energetic Self and the Source as well. Then the ego starts to dissolve. 

The ego has a big part to play in keeping us in the low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions, and therefore, in a position where we ignore the teachings of those who are exposing us to who and what we really are (8/ 2018). 

**Why has mankind always believed that the world will end, e.g. End Times prophecies, pole shift, 10th Planet, global warming, peak oil, Y2K, etc.? The constant state of worry about things that never happen seems like a waste of time and an inhibitor to spiritual growth?** 

It’s also a waste of cerebral horsepower. My understanding is that we have a memory set that we bring into this incarnation based upon our experiences of different civilizations that we’ve incarnated into, including on the Earth. Some of the things they’ve done in the past resulted in the demise of a civilization (e.g. Fall of Atlantis) as a dominant technological and civilization-based collective of incarnate vehicles that we used to experience, learn and evolve. 

Some of the things that we are doing now would trigger a memory that we would access energetically. The potential possibilities of these things may be part of a number of things that could create a cataclysmic effect of some sort. It’s a little bit of self-governance saying, “Well, if we do this, this is what’ll happen, because it happened last time.” 

When we see these things around us, we start to think, “Ah, actually, if we’re not careful, this could happen, because it happened last time.” This was one of the key issues that created that problem and this particular key issue is manifesting itself now. So it’s just warning us that we have to behave ourselves and move ourselves away from certain thoughts, behaviors and actions, because they’ve been seen before (2/ 2019). 

**Djwhal Khul (“ DK”) was an ascended master channeled by Alice Bailey. But DK doesn't give me the sense of being a benevolent, loving master. What do you think about the material channeled by Alice Bailey? Is some of it good and does some of it contain errors?** 

What I’m picking up is that the information Alice Bailey picked up was sporadic, inconsistent and not linear. We understand linearity. It’s not the fault of Alice Bailey, but the fault of her ability to question and keep the entity she’s communicating with on one particular path. Bailey’s questions or direction was such that she gave the impression that certain responses would be preferred, such as political responses, statements about different types of energy, etc. 

The problem with communicating with an entity in the energetic is that they answer things in a way that you request them to be answered in. Sometimes they are very matter of fact, very blunt and not very caring in how they say things, because they don’t have the same evolutionary attachment as we do when we are incarnate. 

They’re very detached basically. Sometimes people who are spiritual leaders end up being detached as well from the things that they experience on Earth, because it creates karma— karma being the attraction or addiction to low frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions. 

What I’m suggesting here is that maybe it’s the fault of Alice Bailey in terms of how she’s linked in with this particular entity and how it has allowed a certain type of answer to come out. You have to check on these things as well. One of the things that I’ve understood very early on is that you have to check the answers you’re given, because sometimes there are inconsistencies and sometimes there are two different answers to the same question. 

You need to understand whether those answers are relevant or not or whether there’s a more global answer and the answer given is just one part of it based upon a different level of understanding. Also we have to continuously check and understand this stuff, not just write it down and put it away. You have to ask questions and be seen to be asking questions for clarification. There’s a slight level of immaturity asking questions and understanding that any inconsistencies from previous information needs to be questioned in itself. 

From that perspective, I think that the level of coherence isn’t a function of the entity itself being in error or being inconsistent or giving clear explanations, it’s because sometimes the channeler isn’t asking the right questions or isn’t being consistent and coherent in the questions they’re asking. It’s jumping around and not being able to stitch them together. 

Although the answers to certain questions from a written perspective appear to be linear, these answers and questions may be asked over a period of months or years. There’s other questions interspersed within them or nested within them, so you have to separate them out and look if they’re coherent. Things that appear to be a conversation on a subject and it is over two pages may end up being discussed over a couple of months or a couple of years. 

You have to make things appear in a logical, linear way. That’s not doctoring the information, it’s making it understandable for us. The information is still right, but it needs to be placed in a logical sequence of events, so one feeds onto the other, so we can understand it. If it jumps around, then we’re not able to understand it and it looks disconnected and confusing. 

Djwhal Khul is not giving the reader the sense of being benevolent, because he’s detached. The questions that Bailey asked and the way it’s presented is not in a good format. I think when you look at these things, you have to work it out for yourself sometimes. If it doesn’t feel right for you, then abandon it. If it feels right for you, then that’s okay. 

If you’re having to investigate it, perhaps the need to investigate it is part of your own experience, your own evolutionary level and that will give you a way of understanding a deeper level of the information and decipher it. 

Perhaps being able to decipher it in a more coherent way is beneficial to others and that is why you’re doing it. Those who decipher some of these confusing statements from different entities and put them in a more digestible format are being of service to those others as well. Maybe the whole point of reading this information is to try and make more sense of it and be of service to others. That’s the way forwards (8/ 2018). 

**One of the metaphors for frequencies is a piano with 8 octaves. We are used to middle C, but courses like yours invite us to play in the higher octaves whereas the news and world events tend to bring us down to the lower octaves. Our challenge is to remember that we have several octaves higher to play with to view the world from a higher perspective?** 

Absolutely. The more we can stay in higher frequencies, the better. We do become detached without a doubt, because the things that would affect us from the purely immersed human state are to us like looking at the world of the microbe or the ant. We’re not bothered by it, it’s too small to worry about. If we can put ourselves in the higher frequencies, then we start to work in a detached way, in a way associated with our True Energetic Selves when we are in the energetic. 

A very good observation and thing to pass on to others. Try to keep yourself in the higher frequencies. One way to do that is to use the “Chakra Opening Exercises” broadcast earlier. If you can use that exercise every day, initially it will be a slow process, but you’ll soon get to the point where you can do it really, really quick. That would put you in a state of detachment and not involvement. 

Although we still have to be responsible for what we do whilst we’re here, we don’t need to take personal umbrage as a result of what happens around us. Even if it affects us, it shouldn’t be an issue. I’ve noticed this a lot within myself. Things that have been within my space that would have normally affected me badly in my younger years don’t even make me blink or flinch now. It’s very much a case of don’t worry about it. If you’re detached, it’s just something that’s happening that you deal with and it’s not really an issue. Thank you for that (6/ 2018). 

**Are those who have found you and your spiritual information of the same vibration and like-minded souls? Historically, revolutions start with a very small percentage— is that what is happening to move the vibrations of the planet higher?** 

Thank you very much for your very kind words. I consider myself to be just one small cog in a very big machine. Yes, the revolutions do start small with a small percentage. It’s not important to have lots of people flocking to you, reading the books, demanding to do workshops, lectures. I’m probably a qualitative individual or working in the background rather than a quantitative individual who wants to get lots and lots of people. 

When you’re in the forefront of understanding things, you find that when you talk about things and understand things, that even those who you think are expansive can’t handle it. That’s when you start to realize that what you’re channeling, understanding and broadcasting is quite a long way away from where people are. 

Even those who are working hard themselves who understand this level of information, that I am fortunate, honored and humbled to be able to receive, are also of a small number and at the forefront of a new sort of revolution of understanding. There are going to be others like me who will take it further and expand the understanding. 

Are you on the forefront? Well, yes, you are without doubt breaking new ground. Everybody who is experiencing through various different channeled sources new information that is unknown or in depth is breaking new ground as well. 

Take a look around and see who else is at the forefront or also a pioneer in spiritual physics, because there’s plenty of others as well. But they don’t always show themselves. Sometimes they’re just people speaking in cafes or getting together at a friend’s house or over a telephone service that allows a number of people to communicate together at one time (8/ 2018). 

**How do we best serve? I am anticipating that this depends on what level you are on– every level has its own service. Your teachings continue to resonate very high. I appreciate you being here and transmitting to all of us who are listening.** 

Well, thank you very much for that. I don’t need to be thanked for doing this work, it’s a pleasure to be of service in this way. 

How do we best serve? The answer is to the best of your ability. It’s as simple as that— doing what you can do for the benefit of others without requiring reward of any way, shape or form either monetarily, materially or spoken rewards is the best way to serve. 

Serve when requested rather than trying to force service onto others. Do the best of your ability for individuals when asked to serve. Serve yourself by thinking, behaving and acting in higher frequency ways. That is the best way to move forwards in terms of service. 

Serve God and in doing the best job you can in what you do— whether it’s your career, whether it’s your interaction with your family or friends, loved ones or your career. Everything that you do, do the best you can, don’t do a half job. Everything you’re doing is to experience the best type of experience, the best level of experience you can do. 

Know that that experience in its purity and its effectiveness is being passed onto your True Energetic Self and also to Source as an enhanced level of interaction with that which it has presented for us to interact with. The most important thing is don’t force your service on others. If you’re asked, then serve when you can. 

There are times when we’re asked to serve, but we know our service won’t benefit individuals, because the whole point of their experience is to sort things out themselves. 

If we give service to people who don’t really need it or shouldn’t have it, they don’t focus on sorting themselves out. They put all their issues onto yourself and then remove their own responsibilities from sorting themselves out and dump it onto you. You have to be very careful with how you work with people sometimes. 

They need to be responsible for their own incarnation and what they’re experiencing and not release that responsibility onto you. Sometimes you may have to detach from somebody and then reattach later. How you do that is best felt and thought about. You need to meditate on it, how to re-interact or continue the lack of interaction, if you’re requested to be of service (12/ 2018). 

**What can you tell us about Sadhguru (India)? Is he a quantitative master? What is his Inner Engineering Yoga? Is it like kriya yoga? What does it intend to accomplish?** 

I’m in India right now, so it’s quite a reasonable thing to ask this question whilst I’m here. I’m picking up that he does quite a good level of work, but he’s not a qualitative guru. I’m also being told he’s not a master as such. He may describe himself as a master, but I’m being told he’s not an incarnate master in terms of being an ascended master or one that could be classified as being a potential future ascended master. I don’t know what his inner engineering yoga is, but it doesn’t sound like it’s kriya yoga, which is based upon breathing techniques and the mental processes derived from raja yoga. 

I’m picking up it’s all to do with the way we think, behave and act, which is a reasonable way forwards in terms of how we can progress spiritually and increase our evolutionary content. If he creates a change in the way in which we think, behave and act with any of the yogic physical procedures, such as exercises, breathing or generation of energies associated with certain mantras, then that would be reasonable and could be considered to be beneficial (2/ 2019). 

**Which Source Entity sent Sadhguru?** 

He’s part of Source Entity One, same as us, so he’s not being sent by any other Source Entity. That would make sense, because he’s not a master as such, so therefore, he’s not associated with any other Source Entity (2/ 2019). 

**What does his yoga intend to accomplish?** 

The yoga intends to accomplish a clarity of thought and mind and body, if used correctly in a pure way. Like everything else, the way to enlightenment is there, provided we’re prepared to work with that way in a pure way. 

Yoga, like many things that are initially physical, are simply a focus to help us become more centered on who and what we are. The potential for self-awareness and then enlightenment is based upon the focus of our concentration through meditation and through various different physical techniques, if needed, to allow us to become our own master, so to speak, of that which we are and the interaction with the environment (2/ 2019). 

**Sadhguru gets involved in his country’s politics and sometimes makes comments that are arrogant. It does not seem too spiritual? Does he also have issues as an incarnated being?** 

In terms of him getting involved with his country’s politics, I don’t feel this is of benefit to him or those around him. Maybe he feels that he can effect a change of thoughts, behavior and action by being involved in politics. But from my perspective a spiritual leader wouldn’t get involved with politics as such. They may have to circumnavigate them somehow in terms of what they’re doing and what they’re trying to achieve, provided it is of the purest sense and it’s there to benefit individuals, and therefore, be of service to individuals. 

But if he’s trying to change the governance of a country by interfering with the politics, then I think that that particular individual may have overstepped their mark, because at the end of the day, you change people’s minds and hearts by being what you’re trying to broadcast to them— leading by example. 

If you’re meddling in politics, like everybody else seems to meddle within, even the politicians meddle with politics, then you’re really heading towards failure. I think that maybe if he’s very self-confident, then that could be classified as being arrogant and rather than being humble. Maybe he feels that in his position, which the individuals around him have placed him in, it is his own divine right and ability to be influential, but that’s a slippery slope and borne upon ego (2/ 2019). 

**What is your take on being vegetarian? Some say that killing plants is like killing animals. Some say that their DNA requires them to eat meat. Is it true that vegetarians are better able to meditate and connect to higher frequencies? Are you a vegetarian?** 

Yes, I am a vegetarian initially for taste reasons. I went off the taste of meat, which includes fish, chicken and other meat products, like beef. That was when I was 24, so I’ve never really returned back to it. 

I feel that the energies associated with animals and certainly the way they’re looked after or not and the way they’re slaughtered isn’t spiritual either, so the energies associated with the anxiety, depression and fear that they have can be broadcast upon the individual who eats the flesh from those animals. 

I don’t recommend it, although some people do need to eat meat. Some people can live purely on meat. Some people can live purely on vegetables and some people live by eating both of them. That’s to do with your genome and the blood type you are— some blood groups are associated with the ability to be omnivorous, carnivorous or herbivorous, so to speak. 

This bit about killing plants is like killing animals, there is no difference? There are levels of intelligence and there is a level of soul type associated with plants. When we do kill plants, there is a level of response from them associated with the level of sentience associated with them in the overall scheme of things, which isn’t a lot, except for larger plants. Sometimes trees have an element of sentience associated with them from the function of being group sentience and group intelligence. 

But mostly with things like plants and vegetables, their level of sentience is so low that although there is an expression associated with the leaves being taken off or them being cut from their roots, it’s not a what you would classify as being self-awareness to the point of recognizing it as pain and a desire to not experience that pain (2/ 2019). 

**How much truth is in the Chinese way of thinking that if you are not a good person, you can reincarnate as an animal or a poor person or disabled? Some sort of payback Karma?** 

We could but don’t incarnate into a lower vehicle. We could incarnate into the animal vehicles, plant vehicles or mineral vehicles, but we don’t, because we don’t gain anything from it. An animal soul could incarnate into a plant vehicle or a mineral vehicle, but it couldn’t incarnate into a human vehicle, because it’s too high. That takes a lot of evolution before they can do that. 

But we can go into all those different levels. The problem is that there’s no evolutionary benefit to us by doing it. From that perspective, we need to think of it in terms of we are a very powerful, highly sentient entity, even though we are smaller aspects of our True Energetic Selves. 

There is no evolutionary benefit to us going into a lower body or a vehicle that doesn’t give us the same advantage for evolving. This is basically a way of controlling people. This thing about if you’re not a good person, you’ll become an animal or you’ll become an ant or cockerel, it’s complete nonsense. It’s just a way of controlling people (6/ 2019). 

**Is it a myth that mirrors are portals?** 

Yes, mirrors are simply a reflection of frequency, which is in the visible range— light. That’s as simple as that. Having said that, anything can become a portal, if you assign the right energies to it and you’re powerful enough to do that. That’s another thing to think about (6/ 2019). 

**What is the benefit of chanting for 108 times? What is the significance of number 108?** 

Simply chanting or creating a mantra is creating a focus. The more you can create that focus by the use of a mantra or chanting, the better the outcome associated with the chanting or that mantra. It’s as simple as that. It’s just creating a focus and chanting whether it’s “Om” or other mantras associated with success or abundance, it’s simply a way of focusing on it. Prayer is a very loose way of focusing on it as well. 

From that respect, I would suggest that there’s no significance in numbers, although if you want to create a mantra, repeat it twelve times, because twelve is an auspicious number that repeats itself throughout the structure of the Origin. It’s an interesting number— it would give you enough time to focus on what you’re doing and settle down. Some people need more repetition within their mantras or their chanting, other people need less (6/ 2019). 

**Does wearing a specific color precious stone in a specific finger enhance or strengthen a specific chakra? Could a specific color precious stone protect our aura or create a shield by wearing that on our fingers? Please clarify.** 

Basically, it’s a physical focus. It’s a personal authority that we give ourselves to allow ourselves to be able to do this stuff. Anything that’s physical is really a crutch. It’s something that we use to say, “Oh, I’ve got this, I’m now clean. I now can do meditation. I can do healing.” It’s simply a physical interface to give ourselves permission to be able to do something. We don’t need it, it’s as simple as that. 

A lot of this stuff about do this, do that or do the other is really complete nonsense. You don’t need to have crystals around. But crystals are useful by the way. They do provide a function, such as healing characteristics. They can be programmed to do other things, such as to create a clear environment. But if you’re the sort of individual who is confident enough in your energetic functionality, then you don’t need any of this at all, because you can do it and you don’t need to have something to focus on. 

There’s a story about Merlin as a wizard. When he was an apprentice, he said there’s a number of different wizards who are using incantations or spells. There are wizards who use their hands or an object, such as a staff, to help them focus and project their energies. There’s those who do it by pure thought. 

The story goes Merlin said, “I’m going to be a wizard of pure thought.” But he couldn’t quite get there, so he ended up being a mixture of an incantation and the use of the hands or a staff to be able to project his energy. He got confused with the gross physical aspect of it and lost his confidence. Maybe the frequencies were a bit lower around him and that meant he had to do this sort of thing to be able to create a focus for himself (6/ 2019). 

**Is it true that when we meditate collectively as a group, we expose ourselves to the energies of the group, so we could contaminate or create energetic links that are not beneficial to us?** 

That depends upon the intention of the meditation, intention of the individuals within the group and the intention of the meditational group leader. If you intend to meditate collectively for a common cause, then you create a synergetic effect, which is the square of the number of individuals. 

For instance, if you have five people in a group, 5 times 5 is 25, so it’s like having 25 people there. The thing that we need to understand is that if we’re going to meditate, then we need to make sure that the intention of each individual in the group is consistent with our own. If we’re happy with that, then we don’t get any contamination or energetic links between them that are not beneficial to us (6/ 2019). 

**Who are the people who work with Abraham-Hicks? What are their collective goals?** 

Well, they are individuals who’ve got an idea about the Law of Attraction and the way to work in a positive way and focus. It’s fairly low grade, but nevertheless beneficial for those who want to work in that way provided you are pure in your application of some of the ideas. But all they’re doing is creating a thought process where you can create whatever you want to create around yourself— like creating your own reality, creating your own level of abundance or a state of beingness or a condition where the individuals of same and sound mind are around you. Basically, they are creating another way of seeing how to work with the energies associated with the universe by being positive in our affirmations of what we want to experience and work with and attract to ourselves. 

I think it’s a reasonable thing, but I’d see it as a stepping stone for most people that are listening to this particular Satsanga (6/ 2019). 

**What are the best ways to achieve and keep a pure mind and thoughts? You taught me this, but it would be beneficial for others to know it as well.** 

It's not being pulled into gossip. It’s looking at the good in everybody and being of service when asked to be of service without complaint and without expecting reward. Basically, meditate on being pure and only thinking high frequency thoughts and having high frequency behaviors and actions associated with them. Just think of it in these ways. We'll use this as a meditation for the next Satsanga to achieve and keep pure mind and thoughts. I think it's going to benefit people more as a guided meditation than just me explaining it (7/ 2019). 

**In The History of God Source said, ”Where do you think the ideas for what you call science fiction come from but the greater reality?” This raises all sorts of delicious lines of questioning. I'm thinking of Star Wars and Avatar, which I assume you've seen?** 

I have and I thought Avatar was very good and quite an interesting way of illustrating how potentially one soul enters a different body. Or how potentially a primary incarnation of a soul can then go into a secondary incarnation. This isn't the same as subincarnations, which are what shards are where a level of sentience from the aspect is separated out and goes into a different body as well. This is the primary incarnation being in one body and then the vast majority of the sentience is projected into another body. 

I think Avatar is a very good concept of that. I think Star Wars was also a very good way of explaining and educating us that there are many different form factors (or species) that we are incarnate into. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, JJ Abrams and all those different people, they are not doing this work for nothing. It's all part of the education process of making different body types acceptable to us. 

The human race in its collective sense doesn't accept change very well, if you look at how the white Caucasian hasn't really accepted Afro-Caribbean, Asian, Chinese Asians or Indian Asians or even American Indians. There's a lot of issues surrounding the different body types that are minor variations upon the human form that we see on Earth. The discrimination is appalling. 

Imagine what the discrimination is going to be like when we've got the different form factors that we see on StarTrek or Star Wars or any other science fiction films. It's all part of the education process that at one point we're going to start to accept that it's just a different body type and the sentience is the same or maybe a slightly different genre of sentience. But we're all souls. 

When we understand that we're all souls and we're using a body to experience, learn and evolve in a lower frequency environment, then we will progress at a much faster evolutionary rate (8/ 2019). 

**Is it possible to bond with animals through a bodily appendage that controls them, as seen on Pandora in Avatar?** 

We used to and still could, if we work hard to link into any animal on Earth or in the rest of the physical universe and experience "coadunation" with them. This word was coined by Julian May who wrote The Many-Colored Land, The Golden Torc and The Nonborn King to describe the co-joining of sentience into a collective sentience. 

But it also could be used to describe the ability to be in communion with another incarnate soul of a higher or lower sentience and share the body type with it. For instance, we can be temporary walk-ins in an animal body, if we wanted to, provided we had the right level of frequency and evolution to be able to do it. It's done quite readily, but right now we're not at the right level of frequency to be able to do that. We need to work on ourselves for about 30 or 40 years and be a dedicated yogi to work on the sentience available to be able to do that (8/ 2019). 

**Is the Star Wars concept of "The Force" something one can tap into and use for good or for evil?** 

In terms of "The Force," The Force is simply the Source, isn't it? It's working with the Source. The energies of the Source have the ability to be used or abused. There are some aspects of the Illuminati who abuse it. There's some aspects of the spiritual individuals who abuse it as well. 

Not every spiritual individual is working for the good of the many. Some of them are working for the good of themselves only and are very selfish with how they do that. So all of these things are reasonable concepts that can be worked with and related to what we're experiencing in reality (8/ 2019). 

**As I am reading The Curators, I find it at times well beyond my comprehension, like I'm a five-year-old struggling to grasp calculus. I realize that I have felt this way before when first reading your other books, which I find oddly comforting.** 

That'll be probably The History of God, Beyond the Source— Books 1 and 2, and The Origin Speaks and probably even The Anne Dialogues (3/ 2020). 

**The notion that I must read and reread to fully absorb what you're bringing makes your work seem like a chest full of treasures that only slowly open up to my understanding. Thank you for all you do and patiently bringing your perspective to humanity.** 

Thank you for reading it. Sometimes people buy the books and they stay in their cupboards or their bookshelves for three or four years before they actually feel the desire to read them. I know a number of individuals who have read them multiple times. I know other individuals who have bought them and haven't read them for two or three years and then they read them and it comes to them. They read the first couple of pages and they can't get into it. It stays in the bookshelf and all of a sudden, when the time is right and they devour it. It's all to do with timing and expansivity. If we weren't being stretched, we wouldn't be evolving. The opportunity to bring more and more detail to individuals, to highlight and illuminate the greater reality in a much more coherent and comprehensive way is an absolute joy. 

I'm writing The Om book now and it's a wonder, an absolute delight to be able to do it. When I was doing the Psycho-Spiritual Healing book, I knew what to do and it was a set framework in my mind. It was like writing a novel. You know every part of every chapter of every scene of scenario, whereas with The Curators I don't know what's going to happen next. That's the joy of writing the books that are channeled information. You don't know where you're going to go next. 

When I read the books myself, if I go back and look at a couple of pages to understand somebody's question from one of the books, I read it and I think, “Wow! That was an amazing piece of work.” I understand it, because it's come through me. But to read it again and look at it, I think this is unbelievably deep information. How wonderfully honored I am to be able to broadcast this information by being a channel for it. 

I'm totally awed and totally in honor of being of service in this way. For those of you who thank me, thank the Source and thank the Origin for allowing this minute individual— irrespective of what his sentient origin is supposed to be— to do this in this particular environment with all the limitations of this particular vehicle as well. Thank you. Namaste, because namaste is a deeper level of thanks (3/ 2020). 

**Do you get certain instructions what to put or not to include in your books? Do you ever hesitate to teach certain things, because if a student is not pure of heart and used that knowledge, it can be detrimental, not only to the person but to the collective as well?** 

Yes, I do sometimes withhold information, because it's not the right time, not the right event space. There are certain things that could be classified as being completely controversial. Their expression would at the wrong time or wrong point in existence where there aren't enough individuals who would be able to understand it, so that would make it detrimental. There are things that I don't teach or don't convey to individuals. Certainly, I've learned that lesson. 

Things have to be fed properly. The wonderful soul, Dolores Cannon, used to say that we are fed things like baby food— we’re spoon fed things. We're spoon fed things when we're capable of eating them. There's no point in giving a baby steak, if it hasn't got teeth. 

That's the same thing spiritually. We need to be able to work with things when we can understand them. People can't understand that an individual who is an “antichrist” is the same and a known role as somebody who is a “Christ.” There's going to be a book on this, so everybody has a role to play. 

Everybody on the planet is important irrespective of what they do. But sometimes people can't understand that the killer is just as important as the individual who is killed from the bigger perspective. Sometimes that knowledge is a double-edged sword that people can't understand, because they're thinking in human terms. 

When people start to move out of thinking in human terms, they can be exposed to higher knowledge. That higher knowledge needs detachment from human terms to start thinking in terms of the greater reality (4/ 2020). 

**What is the nature and source of the material in the book called Voynich Manuscript? It is said to be written in the 15th century. Its language is unidentified by linguists and scholars, so it’s unidentified code. What is its purpose? Who wrote it?** 

My understanding is that it's a very high level language that was based upon really high ranking individuals in the Templar organization. It was to do with understanding the absolute knowledge base of the ancients and trying to pass it on. It was kept at really high levels, so the average templar wouldn't be exposed to it. Those who were the really high masters could understand the information there and were allowed to observe it and digest it, so they could continue to pass that on later. 

There's a number of these around the world, I'm being told, in the same way we know there's a number of different locations for the Dead Sea Scrolls that the Essenes had. It's just that we haven't found them yet. 

They all contain a similar thing. They contain ideas about technology, about civilization and how to maintain connectivity with Source or God or our Higher Self at the same time. It's really about preserving that knowledge, but at a really high level where you have to be a certain level of individual within the Templars. It could even be classified as being the Illuminati these days before you're able to access that level of knowledge by being able to read the text (7/ 2020). 

**Can you comment on the basic premises of A Course in Miracles listed below? It seems that we are all guessing, creating belief structures to replace our ignorance and in the end everything we think we know is pure conjecture? Please comment on each premise.**

**• This world is an illusion, because only what is of God, Love, is real. There is no world! This is the central idea this course attempts to teach.** 

Well, there is a world, because even if it's a temporary reality, that is created by us collectively to allow us to experience something. That collective creation creates an environment to exist within— whether it's a universe, a galaxy, a planetary system, a planet, an island, a country, a city, a village or a house. It is there while we're working with it. So to say “there is no world” is incorrect, because we create it collectively to be able to work with it and experience, learn and evolve through it (9/ 2020).

**• God did not make this world, if He did, God would be cruel.** 

We are part of our True Energetic Selves and our True Energetic Selves are smaller, individualized units of God. When we create something, we create it, because we are part of God and we are God. On top of this, the Earth is part of a structure associated with the multiverse and the multiverse is a function of the structure of the Source, so it has to be part of God. 

Again this is an incorrect assumption, because Source allows anything and everything to happen, because it's all experience. Those things that are suboptimal or negative— if you want to call them that, but I prefer suboptimal— are allowed to exist, because it gives us the correct duality. It gives us the correct benefit of diverse experience. 

It's no good just being in an incarnation where you're only experiencing the good things, because it's biased. It doesn't give you the full detail of what's happening. That's why the Buddha moved away from being a prince to being a pauper, so he could experience the yin and the yang, the duality of this environment we're in now (9/ 2020).

**• God does not know we are here in a world that is apart from Him. He knows and Loves us as an integral part of Himself, as one with Him and His creations.** 

Well, how does that work? So those two lines don't work, don't they? The one contradicts the other, so we can write those two off, because of being unable to be understood properly (9/ 2020).

**• The only Reality is God, and this is why all of the above is true.** 

Well, that's true. The only reality is God and it's created of the Origin and the structure that they are both part of. Because the Origin is an element of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness within a larger, vast energetic structure, it's trying to understand itself. 

But everything is there, and the only reality is that— the greater reality basically. Some part of that statement is acceptable, because the only reality is God, which is true. But all of the above is not correct, because there's contradiction in there (9/ 2020).

**• The only purpose of the illusion is to forgive it, not to love it, not to embrace it, not to change it, or condemn it.** 

Well, I don't agree with that either, because the only purpose of the illusion is to understand it's there, work with it and love it as being a modality for our evolutionary progression. When we embrace it, we work with it. When we love it, we understand it. When we change it, it's because we change it to make it better. When we condemn it, we realize that what we've created isn't acceptable and we look at how we will improve it. 

Some of these statements are back to front, upside down, left and right. They don’t fully concur with understanding who and what we are and what we exist within and what our role within the Source is, as part of a level of structure that is super divided or individualized levels of sentience and energy to investigate one's Self. 

In this instance, the Source is investigating itself in minute detail through the creation or separation of the first part of its structure and giving some smaller parts of itself the opportunity to go investigate that structure. Those smaller parts have decided to give even smaller parts opportunity to go into finer detail, which is what our souls or aspects of our True Energetic Self are. 

I think there's a lot of contradictions in A Course in Miracles. But with all these things, as a discerning seeker of the truth, you have to expose yourself to them to understand which is truth and which is manmade conjecture. 

Once you can sift out the truth from the conjecture, you know each time you pick up another book, see another video, talk to another individual, which is the correct path to navigate down to keep getting truth, truth, truth, truth, truth rather than truth, incorrectness, truth, human thought process, truth, human preference (9/ 2020). 

**What are your opinions about semen retention in spiritual development?** 

Usually, semen retention is for those who want to potentially help others to conceive, if they want to— whether it's for their own family (if they feel that they need to restrict their own potential for reproduction) or to make sure that they can reproduce later (if they know they're going to be ill or they're having surgery, which will affect the production of semen). 

It's not an issue, it's just a physical function. Basically, the reproductive function of the human body is a biomechanical function that is there to allow the generation of more incarnate vehicles. Therefore, an aspect or soul who wants to incarnate will study the availability of bodies vs. family type vs. circumstance vs. environment and then make a choice about which particular body to attach itself to. 

It doesn't matter how that body is conceived—It doesn't matter how that body is conceived— whether it's through natural reproductive methodologies (through two loving partners) or whether it's through a test tube or whether it's done through freezing egg cells or semen— it makes no difference whatsoever. It doesn't affect our spiritual development at all (2/ 2021). 

**After reading The Curators, I am wondering what role Astrology plays in the lives of humanity? What level of the universal or multiversal construct does it apply to?** 

It's a generic construct based on observation of a lot of data collected over a long period of time. It's an understanding that in general people have this type of personality as a function of being born on this particular time (right down to the day, the hour, the minute and the second), which is within a particular location of the Earth around the Sun and the Sun within the galaxy in the way the galaxy rotates around and the energies that affect it. 

What I've picked up in my meditations, it's generally to do with how people end up with this sort of personality, if they're born within this particular region of space and the frequencies associated with them. As you move into higher and lower frequencies, these would change, of course. That shows you that the location or "geographical location" within the solar system within the galaxy, as the galaxy is rotating within the universe is a way of understanding a generic function based upon what's been observed in the past. 

For instance, the more people who have been born in May who show certain traits, then the more you see that those individuals have certain traits. Then you can start to say that they're going to be more like this certain personality as a result of being in that particular birthdate. So it is mainly based upon observation rather than based upon a rule, so to speak. I don't really hold an awful lot of weight against a “horoscope” per se. I think they're too generic in terms of how we can place them (7/ 2020). 

**Is Astrology just the result of intense observation of patterns within a frequency band, and the positioning of planets in reality have no effect on our lives except serving as a symbol of recognition of a frequency pattern?** 

Yeah, astrology is a very, very high concept to understand it. But the astrology we're working on is based upon the rotation of the galaxy, which results in high or low frequencies depending upon the location of the galaxy within the physical universe and the rotation or how long it takes to rotate. When the galaxy rotates, it goes through levels of high and low frequency and those high and low frequencies are repeated, so to speak. 

The personality type of somebody associated with a particular location is generally governed by frequency level. So yes, it is a frequency pattern. Basically, when somebody's born in Taurus, for instance, or maybe even in the Chinese zodiac, you’ve got the zodiac or the location associated with the twelve months of the year. 

It’s twelve, a very magic number that's part of the structure of the Origin and then you also have this number twelve being repeated later, so we have twelve within twelve, which again is an indication of the structure of the Origin. 

In this instance, it's a function of the structure of the physical universe within the multiverse, which is a function of the structure of the Source, which is a function of the structure of the Origin, because the Source is a smaller individualized unit of the Origin. 

So these areas have pockets of high frequency and low frequency and we see how that affects us from a sentient perspective. If we incarnate into a really low frequency state, then we start to be affected by the low frequency state, because we are affected when we're in a low frequency environment. 

But if we incarnate into a higher frequency aspect of that low frequency state, we're more able to use our evolutionary content, and therefore, we're more aligned with higher frequency thoughts, behaviors and actions. So the answer is yes, it's an observation of patterns within a frequency band. Aligning it to a planetary system doesn't actually mean anything as such, it’s just a symbolic explanation of how the frequencies affect us when we're incarnate and that's it (4/ 2021). 

**What about Numerology and Tarot cards? Am I correct in assuming that because of the belief systems one has about them, the Higher Self guides the shard/ aspects through intuition and using the concepts offered by those tools?** 

My feeling is that numerology doesn't give us an awful lot, other than as with tarot cards, it's a focus for us. If we don't have the confidence to connect directly by using our sentience through meditation, which is another tool to get connected, then we sometimes use lower frequency tools, such as pendulums, crystals, stones, candles, burning herbs and cards. 

They're all a focus for us to gain information in a way which we can relate to, because it's a lower frequency modality, isn't it? So they're just there. They're just tools that we use to create a focus and that's it really. It's more than just a belief system. It's about what we're prepared to work with, how expansive we are, whether we need to use these tools or not, as the case may be, and that expansion might be a function of a belief system you might say. 

So yes, I'm sort of half agreeing and half saying, there's a bit more to it than that. But these things are a function of our expansivity and our evolutionary progression— how that affects us or can be used in our incarnation dictates as to whether we can connect directly or whether we need to have a tool to act as a focus to help us connect (4/ 2021).

### 形而上学教义

### Mineral Entities 

These are living entities whose True Energetic Selves have the least amount of sentience (< 20% compared to a TES that incarnates in human form). They incarnate as minerals, rocks and physical bodies like the Earth, moon, stars, nebulas or galaxies in the physical universe. 

**Do the mineral True Energetic Selves also have to evolve through the entire multiverse (from FD 1-12) to reintegrate with Source before the cycle is over?** 

Yes, every True Energetic Self (TES) that was created by the Source in this multiverse has to experience all the environments within the multiverse itself. That means all of the frequencies and all of those universal states and the parallel conditions that are part of it as well. When we’ve moved through every frequency within every full dimension, that is when our own evolutionary cycle is over. Then we can choose to recommune with our Source (8/ 2015). 

**Are these mineral TES destined to be minerals in the next evolutionary cycle as well?** 

No, we can choose to be anything we want to in the next evolutionary cycle, although we can always re-experience everything in a completely different way every time. The mineral entities are not destined to be minerals in every evolutionary cycle, although if they wanted to be, they could be. 

I’m told this is the third evolutionary cycle and in relative terms, we’ve only recently started it. The first two were very slow in terms of the speed at which we went through the cycle. This third cycle is happening quite quickly, which is quite a remarkable thing (8/ 2015). 

**Are minerals imbued by entities that are not alive, but are just learning to be conscious?** 

If you were to follow the Dolores Cannon route of growth of an entity, when an entity starts to become fully aware and sentient, it would be exposed to doing simple functions or tasks, like being a nebula that is sweeping together different energies or experiencing being a mineral, for instance. There are entities that are fully sentient that exist in a fully mineral state. Their sentience moves around the energy associated with the mineral or holds the atoms of that mineral together. 

I’m starting to understand that a mineral can be a lowly evolved entity or a highly evolved entity, which may exist within the structure of the mineral. There are some TESs that are quite highly evolved who wish to put part of themselves into this mineral condition just to experience that level of experience of being slow, being stuck in terms of its ability to move, to experience things, although it’s very, very rare. Generally, it’s those entities that are still on the start of the evolutionary ladder (8/ 2015). 

**In The History Of God discussing the levels of life you said, ”Entities (exist) whose thought processes were so low that they could only gain experience or evolution… by being part of larger objects… such as planets.” Are planets really lower than minerals in awareness? Isn't "Mother Earth" a being with greater awareness than a human being?** 

If you look at the size of the Earth in terms of its mass and volume and then look at the size of a human being in terms of its mass and volume and you look at the sentience associated with a human being (from a minimum of 2.5% to a maximum of 30% TES sentience) and then you look at the size of the Earth and the potential sentience associated with that, then we are infinitely more capable in comparison to the Earth. 

We're experiencing things individually in a microscopic way in comparison to the Earth, but we're also able to affect the Earth in a massive way— a macroscopic way. The lesser sentience associated with the Earth means that it experiences things and acts in ways, which are significantly slower than us. It's to do with the sentience and the processing power associated with that sentience in comparison to how the vehicle that the sentience is housed within is manipulated or used. That allows us to understand how fast something can evolve. 

A mineral in itself on the Earth would probably evolve faster and does evolve faster than the Earth itself, because it's a smaller component of the Earth and may have an individualized function of sentience associated to it, whereas the Earth itself is a larger entity that is being created as a function of the physical universe and has a level of sentience associated with it associated with maintaining its environment in a minimalistic way. 

Mother Earth is of a lower level of sentience than a human being, because of the volume of what it is from a scaled perspective vs. how it can move around and interact with the environment vs. how it can affect its environment in comparison to the almost omniscient level of sentience that human beings have in comparison to the Earth and how we can move around the Earth and how we could in this incarnate state move around the physical universe and affect the physical universe. 

It's this level of sentience and the massive potential that we have as an incarnate human being with our individualized free will why we are compartmentalized frequentially and location-wise within the physical universe, so that anything that could affect other incarnate entities in a negative way or in a "viral" way doesn't affect them. This is why we're in quarantine (7/ 2019). 

**Do crystals/ minerals evolve faster, if they work with humans rather than being part of the planet?** 

Yes, the human soul and the human True Energetic Self are a different quality of sentience, which is a function of evolution. They have a different sentient quotient as well, which is a function of how much sentience is contained within a certain body or group of energies. Those objects, animals or souls that interact with human souls are affected by the higher frequencies. Moreover, they are affected by the quality of sentience associated with human souls. 

So crystals, minerals, plants, trees, animals and backfill people are all affected by human interaction, a loving interaction. If we love an animal, it's a massive gift to them, because it really does accelerate their evolution. Anything that we interact with where we give them love, appreciate it and work with it in a way that isn't detrimental makes it evolve (11/ 2020). 

**Medicine wheels are made with stones, but they seem to be built without concern for ley lines? Are they effective? Are they more effective if combined with quartz crystals?** 

Medicine wheels along with prayer wheels in Tibet are ways of raising energy. A medicine wheel was used by a medicine man (male/ female) to help raise the frequencies of him/ herself and also raise the frequencies of the patient to effect a rapid acceleration in the healing process of that body. There's no need to link in to ley lines, because they're just picking up the prana or the energy that's there and the intention behind those energies to heal. 

They could be used in conjunction with crystals, if those crystals are programmed to work with various different body parts. For instance, you can program a quartz crystal heal your liver or kidneys or pancreas or spleen or heart or eyes or cognitive processes. You can ask somebody who knows what they're doing to program one of these crystals specifically to do that. The medicine wheels can be quite effective, if they're used with the crystals as well (9/ 2020). 

**In The History Of God you wrote, "The major Earth chakras are positioned in… North and South Poles, the center of the Earth, and along… the pyramids in Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, the sunken temple off the coast of Japan, and the temple of Angkor in Cambodia." What does the chakra in the center of the Earth look like? Is it conical or spherical?** 

It's a sphere and that sphere is a nexus of all of the junctures of energy lines between the other chakras. That particular chakra can cope with a number of different frequencies concurrently. It has the connections to all the different energy lines (ley lines) that go to the other chakras. It just absorbs everything. 

The Earth is a panfrequential body, so all the different chakras absorb all the energies at the same time. The chakras on the Earth are all already connected to the energies associated with the physical universe and the multiverse, so they don't need the same configuration as the human body. 

We have major chakras in the human body, we have minor chakras and then mini-chakras. Minor chakras are those like in the hands we use to heal. Chakras on different incarnate vehicles, not the animal versions, but in different locations within the physical universe have different appearances depending upon the frequency that they're in and the frequencies they're dealing with. 

The cone shaped chakra is simply a function of the frequencies that the gross physical aspect of the human form needs to work with. The chakras can have different shapes and sizes and ways in which they can configure vortices (11/ 2020). 

**Which Earth chakras are equivalent of human chakras? Since they are not vertically located like human chakras, I have hard time visualizing which one is which?** 

Each of the chakras is a panfrequential receiver of energy. The human chakras are specifically aligned to one particular frequency within the physical universe. We have certain chakras that deal with the first seven sets of frequencies associated with the physical universe, which are also the first seven frequencies associated with the multiverse. 

But the Earth ones don't. They're panfrequential, so those chakras work with every frequency. Each of those Earth chakras deal with all twelve frequencies associated with the physical universe, hence the spherical nature. Being spherical means it's omnireceptive, so to speak (11/ 2020). 

**In The History Of God you said that rocks were special, because they could allow the transference of energies. In Luke 19: 40, Jesus is quoted as saying, "The rocks would cry out” if the people remained quiet. How common is it for seemingly inanimate objects to be able to do things? Can rocks really "cry out" or is that just a figure of speech?** 

In terms of the Luke 19: 40, Jesus is quoted as saying “the rocks would cry out,” that is simply a figure of speech saying that if something is wrong and if something is happening in the wrong way and nobody mentioned it, then it would be so obvious that the Earth would say something about it. We’re getting that a little bit of that now with some of the things happening in different locations around the world with various leaders. 

Nobody is saying anything about it, because they’re either so dumbstruck that it’s happening or they are just going along with it basically. But if it’s something that’s so radically wrong or so radically incorrect, that it needs to be talked about or needs to be said, or needs to be identified as being wrong, and nobody does identify it as being wrong, then the Earth will create some response or some environmental response that makes us sit up and take notice to realize that it is wrong. That’s the metaphoric statement. 

The rocks in The History Of God really have the ability to transfer energies and some of the sentience associated with energies. They have transition lines within them that are not low frequency. They are high frequency, but the manifestation of rocks being low frequency makes us think that they are low frequency, and therefore, static like rocks. 

But inside them is a matrix or a network of energies that are high frequency that allows other energies or other sentience to move through them. So there are those beings who are sentient that move around them and exist within rock type structures. Their environment is rock type structures or sand-based structures as well (11/ 2017). 

**What does Source say are the top three things that mankind should be doing to recreate balance in Earth’s environment?** 

Stop burning fossil fuels for start off. Respect the environment in terms of don't deforest it. Find ways of manufacturing things that don't damage the environment as well. For instance, the generation of electricity should be done in a more environmentally friendly way. The creation of things that generate electricity should be done in a more environmentally friendly way as well. Those are the things really. 

It's about looking at our resources and doing it in a different way. Generating electricity in a different way. Manufacturing in a way, which isn't environmentally damaging. Don't litter the Earth. Don't destroy the Earth by removing all these rainforests, because they are part of the ecostructure. Without rainforests, we start to change other systems. We start to reduce what was green and verdant land into a desert. 

We've got examples of areas around the world, which are desert. You can understand that previous incarnate civilizations on Earth are responsible for it. Think about what you're doing before you do it. Give yourself time to think about what the best way to do things is. Those are the things that mankind should be doing to recreate balance on Earth (8/ 2020). 

**Most people would agree that we should not be polluting the Earth. Is it that population growth is outstripping gains made in controlling emissions? Is the imbalance caused by greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution? If so, what should be done?** 

Don't forget that emission statistics can be manipulated. If we have a figure of 1000 and it's 99% cleaner, is it that we're 199% better? In real terms the percentage is really a play on statistics. You have to be careful of how the statistics are broadcast and generated. 

The population growth— I've just looked at the world population in 1950 and 1970 compared to now. I’m shocked. Right now we're nearly 8 billion people on the planet. In 1950, we were 2.5 billion. In 1970, we were 3.69 billion, so we've more than doubled in 50 years. That tells you how the population is far outstripping the resources that were here. 

One of the thing we could do is to stop our population increase. That could be one of the major things that we need to do to put ourselves in a position where we're looking after the environment. 

If you look at it in a different way, we are the “virus” on the Earth. The way the Earth is dealing with the virus is “antibodies.” It's things like weather change and climatic change associated with that and things like viruses and disease coming on-board to put in abatement the growth of another virus, which is the human body. 

You can just see how much of a problem we are. We've grown by a factor of three times since 1950. In 70 years we've increased by 5.3 billion and that's why we're having problems with greenhouse gases, emissions, water pollution, stripping rainforests and polluting rivers and the sea. 

We are clever even with our current level of frequency and we can sustain the Earth. But we need to do a number of different things. Stop doing things that pollute. That includes production control. 

Think about treating our planet like we treat our own bedroom— keep it nice and neat, keep the Earth in the same way. We need to stop our increase in population, because it's unsustainable. We find that the population increase tends to gravitate in certain areas where there's not the same level of individual control— control of one's desires, so to speak, as we're thinking in a more physical way. 

So we need to control the population of the Earth and along with stopping fossil fuels, finding other ways of generating power, finding a clean and environmentally friendly way of creating things that generate that power. Maybe we need to use some of the sacred geometry based device to tap into the prana, the free energy or orgone that's already there. That will be the way forwards. But we need to look after our environment more, keep our greenery and re-establish forests without a doubt. Stop reproducing in the way we are right now (8/ 2020). 

**Considering how we are changing the planet, I felt very sad— so much destruction and raping. I realized the only thing we can do is "send love to each and everyone.” This sounds easy, but it’s one of the most difficult things to do?** 

If you think about it, all we can do is forgive and forget and send love. It’s difficult to do, if we’ve been wronged. But it’s worthwhile considering insomuch as if you can negate something by being in acceptance of what it is and forgiving those that have created it, then we will create a level of detachment from that and it negates the power behind it and it loses the karmic influence as well. So forgiving and forgetting and sending love to everybody is a really powerful way of negating any negativity surrounding what’s been happening around us (1/ 2019). 

**It’s fine reading your books about our journey and the multiverse, that’s amazing. But we need to do something— each person working to raise the frequencies in our lives together as a collective. We forget this and need to be reminded.** 

Now you have reminded us. Thank you very much. It’s very important that we do understand that we have got a responsibility for not only ourselves and what we say we’re going to do and work with, but also for the environment that we exist within. If we destroy the environment that we’re in, then we do lose the opportunity to experience evolutionary acceleration through being in this environment (1/ 2019). 

**In The Origin Speaks you talked about a resin device with crystalline. Is it orgonite? What are the effective vs. ineffective or dangerous designs of orgonite?** 

I was given one as a gift and you can get them at a lot of spiritual conferences. They are mixes of crystals and rare earth metals arranged in certain ways. My understanding is that they can be beneficial, but they can be dangerous or ineffective as well, because they need to be joined together properly. It’s alright having these things in resin to suspend them in certain positions, but they need to be connected properly together. Sometimes they need to be laminated together. Sometimes they need to be alloyed together to make them work properly. 

They are simply a way or a device to gather energy and sometimes a way to transmit energy or amplify energy. Just use your intuition when you’re seeing these things. To work properly, the person who has created them needs to be really connected. 

Some of them are based on information given to us from the Atlantean period. Some of them are basic physics and some of them are new to us. I don’t know how to make them. I’m being told if I concentrated and meditated, I would gain inspiration on how to make them properly. But it’s not something I particularly need to use. 

Anything that is physical is simply a physical interface with the energetic and we don’t actually need it. It’s a way of saying that we’re physical beings and we need to have something physical to make something physical work. We don’t need to. We just need to know we can do it. So having something that amplifies energies is actually detaching our sovereign ability from us and making ourselves lesser than we are. 

So my thought processes are why would you buy something that you don’t need to have? That would apply for things like hilo crystals, rare earth metals, pendulums and various types of cards as well. We don’t need them. Just meditate and work hard on meditating, work hard on making yourself pure and then you’ll be able to connect with these different energies and work them in the same way as these devices purport to be able to work with them (7/ 2018). 

**A lot of stores sell minerals and crystals that are by-products of mining precious jewels and rare metals for electronic devices. How does mining affect the local environment?** 

Clearly, the mineral entities have their own level of sentience associated with them. There are certain True Energetic Selves that don't have the same sentient quality or sentient weight that we do, so they are embarking on the evolutionary cycle from a significantly lower level. The energies are there to help maintain the environment that is the Earth eco-structure or ecosphere. Removing the minerals and crystals does slightly upset the local balance, but I'm being shown that it harmonizes other areas, so it creates an averaging effect. When they get sold all over the world, they are creating an overall mean energy system. 

Don't forget that crystalline structures are in connectivity with each other irrespective of where they are, so they're creating a network. They're increasing the network of energy associated with them. It's a bit like it smoothes out the peaks and troughs of the overall frequency of the Earth. Although we need to ask for permission, the movement of crystals from one place to another place, specifically if there's a lot of these crystals in one location, then removing a chunk of them doesn't make a massive difference to their overall frequency or energies there. What's taken out and moved around the Earth is actually creating a harmonization and balancing effect. So it can a positive effect to other areas where they are moved into, so it can be good (12/ 2020). 

**Are Lemurian Seed Crystals really what people claim? They are really pricey, but I am a bit skeptical about their stories. It feels like most of them are just marketing strategies?** 

How do we know a crystal is from Lemuria? How do we know it's from Crete or from a mine in Outer Mongolia? We only have the say of the individual who is selling it to understand its origin, where it's coming from. My feeling is just feel a crystal first before you buy it. 

Like everything else, crystals respond to psychometry— they respond to your intention to get information from them. Ask them where they've come from? Don't go into a shop and spend $ 100 or something on a crystal, because somebody says it's from Lemuria or Atlantis or some other part of the world in a prehistorical condition. Ask the crystal where it is from before you buy it (3/ 2021). 

**Quartz crystals have many variations in color and healers use each quartz for different purposes. What is the relationship between the color and healing properties of crystals?** 

In general, the quartz crystals have certain functions and frequencies depending upon how they are programmed. The colors don’t have much of an effect, except that some colors do limit the function of a crystal or its ability to work with certain frequencies. They’re a bit like a governor. They govern the ability of the crystal to work in a certain way. But once you understand what its limitations or governance is, any crystal can be used for anything. 

For instance, people say a purple amethyst is very good for healing, because their frequencies are usually governed to a higher level, because of their colors. But in real terms, you could use them for other things, like helping you to remember your dreams or what you’ve been doing when astral traveling while you’re sleeping. 

Every crystal can be programmed to do anything really. The level of efficiency of that crystal to work with different frequencies is affected by the color, which is a function of their mineral make up. My feeling and experience with crystals is that although some of them are predisposed to having certain functions, you can pretty much program a crystal to do whatever you want to, if you know what you’re doing and you’re in tune with the crystal, because crystals sometimes have a natural function irrespective of their color. 

Some of them are good for cleansing livers. Some are good for remembering transcendental experiences. Some are good for calming people down or assisting in healing. Some are good for amplifying healing or amplifying certain frequencies naturally. But those crystals can be changed by a good, knowledgeable individual by cleansing them of that natural programming or pre-programming and then giving them another program that you can work with based upon their limitations of the bandwidth of frequencies they can work with (5/ 2021). 

**Black morion quartz crystals have distinctly different qualities than clear or any other quartz. At what level does it work? What is its proper use?** 

The color of the crystal limits or governs the frequencies it can operate with. If I ask what morion crystals are good at, I’m just being told, they’re good for slowing the body’s metabolism down, like reducing blood pressure, for example. You can use them for working with blood pressure and heart issues in terms of circulation. 

They’re good at creating calmness or a good, neutral energy in a space that people use together. For instance, if you’re doing a workshop and put morion crystals in each of the corners of the room or the space you’re using, then it would create calmness. They’re a natural calming energy. 

In general, all crystals can be programmed to do anything. It’s just that the color has some minor effect on the frequencies that they are best or more efficient in working with. That’s probably the best way of saying it. Things like amber is also a good crystal, a good calming energy. Crystals and minerals, they all have a function they work with— depending upon their make up, they have a predisposition to working more efficiently with some frequencies than others, although all crystals can be programmed to do everything (5/ 2021). 

**White sage is used for cleansing space and crystals. How effective is it? How can smoke cleanse space and crystals? Does the cleansing change depending on the plants used?** 

It’s not the smoke that does the cleansing, it’s the frequencies that are incurred as a function of smoke. When we “smudge” a room using sage, we are doing two things. We are introducing a change to the frequential environment with the sage, because we’re using our intention to cleanse the area. The sage is a focal point for our own desire and intention for a space to be frequentially pure or for a crystal to be neutralized and reprogrammed. 

There’s a certain level of physical interactivity from a frequential perspective, because the focus of the sage makes us clean the area ourselves. It’s a tool to help us focus. In essence, we don’t need it. The advanced soul doesn’t need it, it just cleans the area. But some people need to a tool to say, “I’m using a physical tool to do this now, so it must be working.” The sage gives them that physical proof (6/ 2021). 

**Some people soak quartz crystals in a bowl of salt water overnight to reset them. I like to clean them in a river in an ancient forest for an hour. Is this a way of resetting the crystals?** 

Again it’s the intention. It’s using a function that you can relate to, which is physical, like putting the crystals into salt water overnight or sometimes over a full moon in the moon shadow. That is a way of focusing our intention to cleanse the crystal. Taking the crystals into an ancient woodland with a river flowing through it uses a pure area or a higher frequency location that is assisting us. The intention is to cleanse the crystal and we are going through a physical process that we are convinced will cleanse the crystal. 

But in real terms, it’s just our desire, our intention, our thought and our action, which is cleansing the crystal. Everything else is supplementary really. It’s just that we like to use physicality as a focus. The salt water is something we use to prove to ourselves that we’re doing it. In real terms, we don’t need to. 

We just need to use our desire, our intention, our thought and our action to cleanse the crystal, to neutralize the crystal and it will be neutralized. It’s like everything else, like tarot cards, dousing rods or pendulums. These are just different things we use as a physical focus to help us connect in a limited way with the functions we’ve got, should we realize we’ve got those functions (6/ 2021). 

**Do the original locations of crystals affect their properties? Some claim that certain locations (e.g. Alps, Himalayas) have higher frequencies than others?** 

That is only because of the lack of human interaction. A crystal that comes from an area where there’s a lack of human interaction, and is therefore, in a more natural environment will be in a higher frequency environment. It will be more useful instantaneously than the one that’s been stuck in somebody’s backyard. 

The location is really about a jumpstart, a kick start that allows us to use certain crystals quicker. The Himalayas are quite pure, because not many people live there. Same with the Alps. Human interaction is what lowers the frequencies of crystals unless you’re a higher frequency individual in which case it’s maintained. It’s about the overall frequential level of the place that the crystals are taken from (6/ 2021).

### 矿物实体

### Multiverse 

An environment with multiple universes created by a Source Entity. Our multiverse has 397 universes. The physical universe is the bottom universe. We exist in the lowest three frequency bands (FB 1-3), when we incarnate as human beings with physical bodies. 

**How were the universes formed? Was it solely the work of the Origin or the Source Entities? Did our True Energetic Selves come before or after and have a role in it? The creation of planet Earth is completely improbable without assuming some “supernatural” intervention. Who created our present day physical bodies?** 

The multiverse and the universes within in it were created by the Source (SE1/ God) in its first desire to create an environment or structure where its Self could be analyzed by the creation of smaller units of itself that could go into the minute detail. Everything was created by Source. 

Some of the modifications have been done by the True Energetic Selves (TES) at a later date. There's some modifications created by some of the True Energetic Selves that were created by Source and some minute or detailed modifications done by some aspects of some of those TES as well. Some of those aspects created the physical bodies. 

There has been some level of Darwinian evolution, because some of the bodies we have today were created in times of higher frequency, so other human form bodies have been reintroduced to cope with lower frequencies, because it was anticipated that those higher frequency human forms wouldn't be able to survive the drop in frequencies, but some of them did.

On the Earth we've got a mixture of physical bodies that were originally created by some of those aspects projected from the TESs that were helping to create a condition, where we could accelerate evolution through individualized free will. 

There are minor changes done by these aspects, bigger changes done by the TES, but initially everything in the multiverse was created by the Source Entity. The minute detail is done by the TES and by the aspects as well. Of course, there's natural evolution, so we have reintroduction of the human body at different frequential levels. 

But some of those reintroduced human bodies did adapt as a result of Darwinian evolution to the lower frequencies. That's why we've got the diversity of the human form now, not as a result of their location geographically on the planet Earth (5/ 2020). 

**In Beyond the Source— Book 1 you said there are 397 universes within our Source Entity. Where are the energetic realms? Where do our True Energetic Selves exist?** 

My understanding may change in the future, as I get exposed to higher frequencies and wider concepts and I am able to understand more. The True Energetic Selves (TES) evolve through these different universes and progress from one to the other. 

Although the information has been given to us in a linear way, it’s not important for us to progress in a linear way. As aspects, we can go to the 51st universe and experience that, then go to the 359th universe to experience that and then come back to the 17th universe and experience that. Although we’re bouncing around, we have to experience every simultaneous universe before we can finish our incarnate cycle. 

Behind all of this is a function where we are evolving. We can use the multiverse and its linear understanding to understand how our TES evolves. The frequencies associated with the multiverse go from being very coarse at the bottom (physical universe) to extremely ultrafine at the top. As we go to a higher frequency universe, the amount of content, ability and functionality associated with that universe increases. 

We get exposed to these higher frequencies and higher functions. As we work with those higher functions in a creative way, we experience, learn and evolve more and we ascend the frequencies to another level, which exposes us to even higher functionality and more universal content. We work our way up the multiversal structure this way, so each of our TESs can experience the universes associated with the multiverse, either in a linear way (as a TES) or in a random way (as an aspect). 

The location of the TES is related to its linear progression within the multiverse structure rather than outside of it. In contrast, the maintenance entities (or Curators) operate outside of the structure to make sure it’s in optimal evolutionary condition. These entities include the elementals, angels, archangels and many other entities described in The Curators (11/ 2015). 

**Does that mean we only have 11 full dimensions?** 

No, there are 12 full dimensions. It’s just that the the physical universe takes a full dimension, the whole first dimension to create it. It takes three subdimensional components, which compact down into one “composite subdimension” that then splits into 12 frequencies. 

Those frequencies are too coarse to be able to hold all of the content associated with a self-contained universe, so you need all 12 frequencies to make the physical universe work. 

But when we go to FB 13-14, those frequencies are fine enough to house the content of a whole universe in their own right. Once everybody is operating on the 12th frequency (FB 12) when they are incarnate, the whole physical universe will move to the 13th frequency (FB 13). Then we will continue our existence there, which won’t be really “incarnation,” not like in the physical universe. 

It will allow us to have a different type of experience, to use the lower frequencies in a different way. Then FB 14 is the same, the next progression up. After that, there’s no need for us to enter any incarnate vehicles at all. Once we’re at FB 15, our true evolutionary progression in the energetic can be measured (11/ 2015). 

**In The History of God each of the 12 dimensions in our multiverse was described as having a certain function or “personality” associated with it. Please elaborate.** 

What I’m starting to understand now is that the full dimensions themselves, as part of a higher structure within the multiverse, also have an alternative function that isn’t to do with structure. It is the way the multiverse as an entity created by the Source works on its own. 

The dimensions have a structural component to them, but there’s also a “personality” or flavor or signature associated with each of the twelve full dimensions (from FD 1 to FD 12). 

For instance, the first three dimensions are called Height (FD 1), Width (FD 2) and Depth (FD 3). The idea of height, width and depth is to do with the maintenance of the intention for the multiverse structure to exist. Specifically, FD 1 creates the foundation of the multiverse, which is the physical universe where we exist right now. But FD 2 and FD 3 create the intention for the rest of the multiverse or the essence of structure or the way forward. 

The fourth dimension deals with Event Space (FD 4), which represents the potential for myriad parallel universal environments. Everything that can exist will exist as a possibility of possible possibilities, etc. Event space is not linear, it is convolution within and without. 

Event space is a concurrent representation of everything that is, was, would be, should be, could be, may be, possibly would be and all the different fractalizations of those statements. 

The fifth dimension is about Thought Given Form (FD 5), which is a product of intention, which in turn is a product of desire. This is the idea that we can create and that we are ultimate creators. 

The sixth dimension is about Belief (FD 6), which is the knowledge of who we are. Belief is the reason for being in existence— that part of us, which makes us be here. We believe we’re in existence. We know we’re in existence. We work and evolve with that existence. 

The seventh dimension has a signature associated with Harmony (FD 7). It is the ability for the structure to work within itself. It is allowing the frequencies to be harmonized and in contact with each other concurrently. There is no abrasive content associated with the connectivity of the two different frequencies, so this dimension in its position has both stability and harmony. 

The eighth dimension is called Hope (FD 8), which is a marker of inevitability. Hope is based upon the desired intention to create something and then the incomplete response or the lack of conviction that what we’ve created will come into existence. Rather than hoping for something to be created, it is a function of inevitable success of creativity. 

The ninth dimension is about Interconnectedness (FD 9), which is the connection between the lowest frequency and the highest frequency. Note that every frequency within the structure of the Origin and most structures beyond it are already connected to each other. There is no such thing as linear connection or compartmentalization. There is no such thing as being able to access a particular energy in its function based upon how we can try to make it work for us. 

For example, if we have a marshmallow with a certain signature in a box with other marshmallows with a different signature, it won’t be able to communicate with those marshmallows. Therefore, it will be ejected from the box. When the harmony disappears, the interconnectedness disappears as well. 

The tenth dimension is associated with Temporal or Event Space Stability (FD 10). This is the ability of event space to recreate itself or the number of times it can recreate itself. 

It freezes or stops and recalibrates itself to allow itself to evolve— to allow itself to become strong and to become weak without being affected by external event spaces. Event space works for as long as it can do with all those other entities that are higher creators that create additional parallel conditions within event space. 

The eleventh dimension is about Universal Creation (FD 11), which is possible, because the energies are so close to Source. Any entity that exists within the 11th dimension should be able to create anything it wants to. It’s all about the ability to create what is in existence and what is beyond that in existence and all that can be connected to the creative process. 

The twelfth dimension is called Total Awareness (FD 12). This is about oneness with the Source and the Origin and constant connection with all dimensions at all times. At this level, we have the ability to be one with the Source in a most profound way, so we can create anything. 

We can communicate with Source. We can communicate with all of the structure of the multiverse in its individualized components at different frequencies or universal environments. We can connect with the base resonant frequencies of the Origin, so we have connectivity all the way through with total awareness of everything that is there. 

This dimension is to do with being in connection with all dimensions at all times and having the ability to change the location of the sentience within those dimensions as well (3/ 2015). 

**Why is Full Dimension 10 called “temporal/ event space stability?”** 

It’s called temporal/ event space stability, because a lot of the entities that have used that dimension do create lots of event spaces. They create things and try to stabilize it. 

The whole point of that particular dimension is to work with parallel conditions concurrently and to work with how they fractalize, to control the fractalization, so you continue to keep it on one main road rather than lots of different main roads there (4/ 2015). 

**Is there a limit to how many times an event space can expand and contract within a multiverse structure?** 

No, there is no limit at all. The only limit would be how an entity decides to choose. If the entity continues to choose or make decisions, then it’s possible that event spaces would continue to grow fractally, like the branches on a tree that continues to become more branches and more and more branches. 

They only collapse when the evolutionary opportunity associated with one particular branch comes to a dead end. Then that branch may collapse and others may collapse around it, because they’ll all be linked together. The decision process associated with going down that one particular branch or other branches starts to become severed, therefore, it all dissolves. 

In essence, there is no limit to how many times an event space can expand or contract. It just depends on the entity. From an incarnate perspective, the number of event spaces that we create ourselves in this state is limited only by the length of time that we are incarnate in this particular body (4/ 2015). 

**In The History of God the Origin said the dimensions and the frequencies are in effect the same thing— one is separate whereas the other is together. Can you explain that?** 

Anything that is created is a function of the structure of the multiverse. We have full dimensions and frequential states within them. 

The dimensions split out into three subdimensions. Each of them houses 12 frequential states, so each full dimension has 36 frequential states within it. In essence, the one is a function of the other, because a dimension is a condition that allows the framework for something to exist within it— like a building. 

When we build a skyscraper, we dig out a foundation and build a framework, which is usually concrete and steel. That could be used as a descriptor for the dimensions. 

Then we have the rest of the building being made, such as the brickwork and the gaps between the concrete and steel structure. That is a descriptor for the subdimensions, because they fill the gaps in between the bigger structure or the dimensions. 

Then we’ve got frequencies, which are the stairs in between the floors in the skyscraper or the gaps in between the states of beingness within the subdimensional components. Then within all the floors, we’ve got the infrastructure, such as the piping, electrics, decoration, furniture and those sorts of things, which pull it all together. 

That’s how we get the structure that allows the finer structure to exist within it. The Source separated part of itself to exist as the structure, which is the multiverse. It then hived off smaller parts of its own sentient energies to occupy that space— the Higher Selves that project smaller aspects (souls) to explore the finer detail within the multiverse. 

The structure of the multiverse allows everything to happen at the same time. Reincarnation exists, because we choose various different conditions to be in. We think it’s linear, but actually all incarnations are now. None was before another, because everything is happening concurrently (6/ 2016). 

**In The History of God you mentioned macro-universe, micro-universe and minor-universe. Do they apply to our multiversal structure or not? Please give us some real life examples of each term and what level they operate at?** 

These terms don’t apply to the multiverse created by our Source Entity (SE1/ God). They are examples of structures that another Source Entity would create. Or another structure outside of our Source but within the Origin. Here is a brief explanation of the terms: 

• Macro-universe— a complete universe where our own universe would serve to be the sub-atomic levels. A macro-universe is a much bigger piece of structure and it would still be within a multiversal structure, but not in our multiversal structure. This is looking at a structure where there’s structure within the structure. A macro-universe is a complete universe where our own universe would function at the subatomic particle levels. 

• Micro-universe— a complete universe at the scale of the subatomic. Basically, the micro-universe is what our universe would be within a macro-universe. 

• Minor-universe— a universe of lesser content in terms of dimension and frequency and habitation— one of lower importance. That is the subatomic of our subatomic, if you like. If we have a condition where we have structure within structure, not specifically how our multiverse or local universe is created. This is to do with a different structure where we have structure within a structure as a function of a static structure. 

For example, if we have a macro-universe, our universe would be at the subatomic level. If you think about the atoms within the macro-universe being what our universe is, then the atoms within our universe would be the minor-universe. The micro-universe is where we are now. The macro-universe is a bigger structure above us and the minor-verse is the structure well below us (2/ 2017). 

**In The History Of God you said there are whole universes that occupy the space of a quark. Is this where some of the Source’s 408 universes are located?** 

My latest understanding of the occupation of space was difficult to put my head around. But simply put the universes are separated not only by frequency but also a spatial location within the space they are allotted within the multiverse. They occupy the space in various different ways, so the opportunity for the universe to be within a quark is there as well. 

It’s to do with how the universe interacts with the structure of the multiverse on a frequential basis. That frequential basis is either in the subdimension or the full dimension that can be occupied in various different ways. The quark may be potentially the lowest denominator in terms of the atomic structure of things that we understand (2/ 2018). 

**If we call the Earth populated with sentient beings a world, then how many physical worlds are there within our Source? How many nonphysical worlds? If all humans currently on planet Earth were to disappear, would Source Entity be diminished?** 

No, if all humans or all entities and beings left the Earth, Source Entity wouldn’t be diminished, because this is simply a place where we are incarnating into. It’s an environment that we experience to progress our evolution. How many physical worlds are there within our Source? 

Well, the physical worlds are all within the first universe. If you classify them as gross physical (FB 1-3), then we have some physical worlds at our frequency that we can see. Then there’s the worlds or planets in all of the higher frequencies above us within the physical universe (FB 4-12). There’s environments in all of those where some form of incarnate vehicle— whether it’s lower frequency or higher frequency in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth frequencies— that allow entities to incarnate into and experience low frequency environments within the physical universe. 

There’s countless worlds. If you think of the billions of galaxies within the physical universe that are found in the first three frequency levels— the gross physical ones that we can see or the stars we can see through our telescope technology— then multiply it by countless thousands or even millions that are available within each galaxy, then you can see that there’s millions and billions of planets. That’s just at the gross physical level (FB 1-3). 

Then you look at all the planets that are “panfrequential,” like the Earth, which is visible on all twelve frequencies of the universe (FB 1-12). There are other planets that are only visible from the fourth or fifth or ninth frequency upwards. Then you have to multiply that figure for the gross physical by the different frequency levels as well. Then it is millions and billions to the power of 10, just to give it an example. There’s no way that the Source Entity is going to be diminished. 

However, the Earth right now is the only planet where we’re allowed to have individualized free will. The opportunity for our True Energetic Selves and Source to accelerate their evolutionary progression would be reduced, if the Earth were to disappear. 

There would be some level of slowing of the overall evolutionary progression, if we didn’t work on the Earth. At some point, we will migrate beyond the need to be on the Earth. When we’ve moved past that and our free will is recognized as being an evolutionary accelerant, then the other vehicles that are still in the rest of the physical universe will be given individualized free will to experience for the first time.

When all those entities have got to the point where they have mastered incarnation, then there’s no need for any of us to incarnate into the physical universe, so we’ll move beyond that and it won’t be used any more. We’ll just move into the next level of frequencies and keep experiencing those to continue our evolutionary path (9/ 2018). 

**Regarding the “New Earths,” is the fourth frequency Earth yet to be populated in our third frequency timeline? I assume that all Earths exist simultaneously in event space. Are the continental structures, oceans, buildings and history the same from Earth to Earth?** 

From an event space perspective, everything is happening concurrently. If you wanted to move into a different event space, you could use your meditation to allow you to work with event spaces where you’ll be able to experience these different Earths concurrently. People who move into different event spaces are people who are able to predict the future, because they move from one event space to another. In terms of the continental and the oceanic structures, in general, it’s the same planet, but at a different frequency level. So the answer is yes, although the population will change. If we consider that everything is happening concurrently and we move from one New Earth to the next New Earth— for instance, from the third to the fourth frequency or jumping around from the fourth to the fifth or the seventh to the ninth— then we would see that there’s a cumulative effect on what’s on the planet. 

There’s two things occurring. The outside observer can see everything that’s occurring in all of these different Earths. For instance, if you’re on the ninth frequency, you’d see everything on the ninth level and everything below it on the eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth and third frequency levels all together. 

But if you just wanted to focus on the ninth level, you’d only see what’s on the ninth— the others would be phased out, because they are outside of the frequential bandwidth associated with the ninth frequency. They wouldn’t want to observe those New Earths below them. They could if they wished, but they generally don’t, because there’s no point in doing that. 

Although there are individuals who do move down the frequencies to interact with those who are at this level, they have to protect themselves frequentially by some mechanical means while maintaining their own frequency. Or if they are highly evolved whilst incarnate, then they will be able to create their own protection, as they go down the frequencies. 

Yes, it is populated and is being populated on a regular basis by individuals who move from one level to the next. There are individuals who are progressing from the third to the fourth and those that go from the fourth to the fifth, but not many. 

They tend to be in incarnate vehicles used by other entities that we call aliens. They’re just incarnate vehicles that are naturally existing on the fifth level, for instance. They can visit the Earth, see what’s happening and access the different frequencies associated with the Earth, and therefore, see what’s happening on these different levels as well. Some of the craft they move around in are what we call UFOs. Sometimes we see them glowing, which is the protective shield that keeps them at their own higher frequency existence (9/ 2018). 

**I used to think there are 408 universes in our multiverse. But since the first twelve floors form the basement or the physical universe, are there 408 minus 12 universes, so the total is 397 universes? This came from The Origin Speaks.** 

The multiverse is created through twelve full dimensions. Each of the full dimensions (from FD 2-12) operate in the same way apart from the first full dimension (FD 1). Each of those full dimensions splits out into three subdimensional components. Each of the subdimensional components splits out into twelve frequency bands (FB). 

Each of those frequency bands is capable of supporting a self-contained simultaneous universe in its own right. That universal environment is a static piece of structure, which is in existence all the time. It’s not the same as parallelism that’s created by event space, so their static structure isn’t changed by the parallel conditions. 

We have 11 full dimensions x 3 subdimensions x 12 frequencies, which gives us 396 frequency bands that correspond to 396 simultaneous universes. In addition, we have the first dimension that houses the lowest 12 frequencies. It also splits out into three subdimensional components, but they are compressed back into one “composite subdimension,” which means it only has 12 frequencies in the physical universe (FD 1). 

The total number of frequencies includes the lowest 12 frequencies (FD 1) plus 396 frequencies (FD 2-12), which equals 408 frequencies in total. The physical universe is unique, because it requires a whole dimension and twelve frequencies to create it, whereas all the other simultaneous universes are created by just one frequency within a full dimension. We have the physical universe at the bottom plus 396 universes above it, which gives us a total of 397 universes. 

That’s why we have 408 frequencies, but only 397 universes in our multiverse (5/ 2019). 

**In The Curators discussing The Universalists, you state that there are 397 universes. What happened to the other ten universes I recall from another of your books?** 

In The History of God I was told that there are 12 full dimensions and each of these full dimensions had three tritaves or subdimensional components.Each of those subdimensional components had 12 frequencies associated with them.So if you add all those together,you've got an awful lot of potential multiverses.In fact,you'll find that if you multiply 12 x 3 x 12,you get 432 universes. 

But later on in The History of God and maybe in the Beyond the Source-Book 1,you start to realize that the information I was understanding was in slight error.The multiverse is created through 12 full dimensions,but they all work in the same way apart from the first full dimension. 

The 2nd full dimension to the 12th full dimension behave in exactly the same way.They split out into three subdimensional components that are sometimes called tritaves,and each of those tritaves or subdimensional components splits out into 12 frequency levels or frequency bands.Each of those frequency bands has the capability of supporting a self-contained simultaneously occurring universal environment,so this is a static structure. 

So that's 11 x 3 x 12,which is 396 universes.Then I found out later that the first full dimension or physical universe works in a different way,because it houses the lowest frequencies.So we get the three subdimensional components being split out, but then it collapses back into a "composite subdimension, which only allows 12 frequencies to be created,because it's all low frequencies.Those 12 frequencies are all required to create a universe. 

In comparison,from the 13th frequency upwards (first frequency of the second full dimension),it's got enough resolution or finitude to enable a universal environment to be created,whereas in the first full dimension,you need all those frequency levels to create it,because they're so low frequency. 

We've got a difference in the number of frequencies and the number of universes.We have 396 12 frequencies,which is 408 frequencies,but 396 1 universes,so it's 397 universes. That's where you start to see the difference between 408 and 397,which is basically 11 difference.You can see the difference between The History ofGod and Beyond the Source- Book when I'm speaking to SE1 there. 

Actually,I'm quite shocked,when I'm told by the Source that I was in error or I found out that I was in error.I was wondering why I was allowed to be in error for a start off,but it's all to do with being allowed to go in a certain direction, even if it's not strictly the right direction.As long as it's generally in the right direction,then we're allowed to do it (7/2020). 

**The Origin said SE1 "created the multiverse as an environment for structured energetic ascension and populated it with smaller versions of itself,giving them the power of creativity as a prerequisite for gaining experience." Do we have "the power of creativity?"** 

Absolutely.The whole point is that the multiverse is a playground.It's a playground based upon a separated out area of the Source Entity's own structure and sentience.Some of that sentience is us,but the multiverse has a level of sentience as well.What we experience within that multiverse and how we create within that multiverse and what we gain from the experience within that environment is what we use to evolve. That level of experience is what we create.We create an experience. 

For instance,if we decide to drive to an airport rather than get a taxi to the airport,we've created a condition,where we're experiencing one thing vs.another,so we've created a condition of experience through choice.If we get a lift from a friend instead of taking a taxi,that's a different experience again.We've got three different experiences-one is to go by taxi,one is to drive ourselves and park our car and another one is to get a lift by a friend. 

Although we,as one parallel self,would experience the one dominant experience,because we decide to go one way,let's say,we take a taxi,then another part of us splits off where we create another localized event space where our second parallel self is being taken to the airport by a friend.Then our third parallel self may choose to go to the airport by driving a car and parking it in the car park.This is how we create lots of different things in lots of different ways(5/2019). 

**In the second dimension,how are those nonphysical universes experienced?Are the entities experiencing them or are they "dreaming"that they are doing so?It seems regardless of the dimension or universe,all experience is a function of different levels of awareness?** 

All experience is a function of different levels of awareness- irrespective of where we are.Let's say,we're in the second full dimension and we have 36 universes in there (supported by 36 frequency levels),the way they are experienced is determined by the collective desires and creativity of the entities that occupy those universes. 

For instance,the environment might be similar to an Earth- based environment or a liquid environment or a gaseous environment or a pure energetic environment or a formless environment or full of form environment or a solid environment.It just depends on how many individuals want to create that collectively and how they want to experience it and maintain it in existence. 

When a soul is not subconsciously focused on the maintenance of the environment,then another soul is doing it for it.There's always enough souls there to maintain the structure of what's there.It's a bit like always having somebody there to change the donkey.When the donkey is going around a mill stone,the donkey can get tired and another donkey takes over.It's always happening.There's always a soul or a group of souls somewhere who are finishing their shift,so to speak,and starting their shift and halfway through their shift. 

But it's difficult to interpret it in human terms,what a soul or an aspect would experience in one of those universes that are within the second full dimension.It can be completely different or it could be exactly the same,because the souls decided to create an environment,which is the same as the Earth,which is the same as the physical universe,including the galaxies,etc.Sometimes those expressions are in very small pockets within those universes,so you might get“multipolous'”(a multiple of a multiple) different environments expressed within one universe. 

Regarding our physical universe (FD 1),we don't even know what they can do in this universe yet,we just know there are planets and atoms,galaxies and nebulae at our level.We don't know what's in the 4th frequency,because we haven't got the technology to see it.We don't know what's in the 5th or 6th or 7th or higher. 

We just have to use our imagination and know that whatever is being experienced is a function of what was created by the entities in there.It's created in a way that allows them to experience,learn and evolve in a diverse way,in a complete way and a balanced way(7/2021).

### Multiverse Cycle 

Multiverse Cycle An evolutionary cycle of the multiverse is created by our Source Entity (SE1/ God). The cycle starts with the expansion (“ breathing out”) of all entities into the multiverse structure, so they can experience and work through all the universes within it. When all True Energetic Selves have evolved to the top frequency (FB 408), they re-commune with the Source. That is the phase of contraction (“ breathing in”), where the Source contracts all its sentience back to itself.

**In Beyond the Source— Book 2 you said our Source was not paying enough attention, so it created five different types of entities or “energetic genres?”**

Our Source was creating without paying attention,and therefore,we got the different types of entities that we have.They include those entities that are classified as incarnate mankind and other entities, including the backfill people,animal entities and the entities that are lower than that,which are plants,minerals,planets,galaxies,all those sorts of things,including the entities that go into service work(Guides, Helpers)and maintenance entities(Curators). All these entities were all created by our SE.They can only exist within the energies assigned to them,which includes the structure for evolution,which in our case is a multiverse that we evolve through. When we've reached our evolutionary maximum by going up all the way up to frequency band 408(FB 408),we can recommune with our Source,if we decide to do so. We can become one with the Source again,but we can still maintain our individuality.It's almost like rather than being a sentient entity that is using a body of energy of various different types,we can remerge that body ofenergy and sentience back with the Source at end of our evolutionary cycle by working our way through the multiverse. We can also regain that individuality as well,if you want to move back out of that level of communion(5/2014). In the next cycle,will Source keep its eye on the ball,so we won't have backfill people or lower energetic genre True Energetic Selves (like minerals,plants and animals)? As I was reading this,I was getting a bit of information from the Source on this referring to The History of God and Beyond the Source-Book 1 where we talk about the creation of the TES and the various different qualities of them.That statement related to the firstevolutionary cycle, not this one.All the aspects that have been created are reused,if they want to be reused. When we finish an evolutionary cycle,we recommune with our Source in a similar way that the aspect recommunes with its TES after an incarnation has been experienced and understood in its entirety after the life review.If it decides to go into full communion,then it will become part of the Source and the total sentience will dissolve into it totally becoming Source rather than individualized sentience. But if a particular TES decides it wants to stay individualized whilst in communion,there are different ways of doing that.The aspects that are there are re-selected by Source and even those who seek dissolution can be reconstructed again by the Source,if it feels that a particular TES is useful in experiencing a certain experience(8/2015). Do we stay in the same True Energetic Self through many evolutionary cycles?Or can we switch TESs? We are the TES and we are a function of the TES.We are pure sentience. We've been either given a body of energy by our creator or we've commandeered a body of energy.We can switch energies as sentient beings,so the sentient energy that could be construed as being one particular TES might change,if that sentience has decided that that body of energies is no longer relevant for its use or for what it's trying to achieve.It can move around and that usually happens with a change in the evolutionary cycle,when one cycle ends and another begins. When this evolutionary cycle finishes,the TESs return to Source.They they can either choose to go into the full communion or any of the five different forms of partial communion where they may choose to keep a certain part of their energies or dissolve those energies within Source and distribute their sentience accordingly. Note that the TES sentience is a smaller part of the sentience that is Source,because it's an individualized unit of Source Entity sentience that is allowed to house itself in a body of energies used to work with an environment.We would change just before a new cycle begins. We have talked about the "breathing in"and "breathing out"of the multiverse (or "universe"in the Hindu sense).The breathing in of the universe is when all of the entities that have finished the evolutionary cycle start to coalesce back into Source.The Source reuses the energies that it used to create the multiversal environment.Next the Source disassociates its sentience from its body of energies and moves into a different location within the Origin where it commandeers energies that will have a slightly different flavor to them. Then Source recreates an environment-in whatever way it wants to- and separates itself out again into TESs-either creating new units or reusing the existing individualized units-assigning them with a body of energy and allowing them to choose what they want to do. The TES can enter back into the evolutionary cycle or be of service to those who enter into the evolutionary cycle.The breathing inis the end of the evolutionary cycle where everything is brought back into the Source.The breathing out is the expansion of the Source's body of sentient energies into another part of the Origin where it recreates another environment and repopulates it with TESs. In my understanding,we're on the third evolutionary cycle,so it just happened.That's the explanation that I've got,which correlates with the ancient Hindu texts,as described in The Origin Speaks(9/2015). When we start the fourth(next)multiversal cycle without a physical universe (without incarnation),how does that change the structure ofthe multiverse?Is it just 11 full dimensions then or what happens? That's a very good question,because it's not something I've dealt with. My understanding through a series of communications (channeling) about four years ago suggests that we go through various different evolutionary cycles,as our Source moves around the "known area"that the Origin reserved for our Source Entities to go through. Basically,the Source Entities and us through experiencing the environment we're in re-educate the Origin by default as to what's in that environment,how it works,how it can benefit us and how we can move forwards and experience,learn and evolve in the most efficient way. To do this,the Source Entities move through the Origin's area of "polyomniscient sentient self-awareness"that is still unmapped.The Source experiences this area through us.When our Source is finished with this particular location of the Origin,it will regroup.It will bring all those True Energetic Selves back into itself,recommune with those beings,remove their sentience from the body of energy that it's been using for countless billions of millennia and relocate the sentience somewhere in a fresh piece of energy that hasn't been experienced by it. Then it creates a body of energy and creates structure.It may or may not be a multiversal structure-we don't know.It's up to our Source as to what happens next.If you read the Beyond the Source-Book I and Book 2,you'll realize that each of the different Source Entities is doing this in a different way.From our perspective,what we're experiencing in this particular evolutionary cycle isn't what we might experience in another evolutionary cycle. It depends upon the structure within the Source,which is part of the structure of the Origin that the Source uses,as to whether we have the lowest frequencies of the multiverse or not.What type of multiverse we have is up to the Source,so it's quite likely that we will not have a multiversal structure when it goes into its next phase of evolution.But I'm being told that we won't be using the physical universe or the lowest frequencies. How do we get there?Basically,the Source moves its sentience from one body of energy to another within the Origin.It can choose a body of energy that doesn't contain the lowest frequencies associated with the Origin.In not choosing the lowest frequencies associated with the Origin,it doesn't give the opportunity for experiencing incarnate existence in any of the frequencies associated with the physical universe,which are the lowest 12 frequencies (3/2017). Is it just 11 full dimensions then or what happens? Basically,the Source could use the next level of structure and go for zones,full dimensions and then sub-dimensions,but not bother with the frequencies.We might not necessarily have 12 full dimensions, because there are 12 full dimensions per zone.It might be that we don't classify things in terms of full dimensions,we classify things in terms of zones from that point,because the zones are the next highest structure within the Source and the Origin. That's a long way away then-nothing that we need to worry about whether we're incarnate or disincarnate.It's going to be a long,long time in the future.Having said that,I am advised that we are moving through this third cycle extremely quickly-much,much faster than at this stage in the first evolutionary cycle and the second evolutionary cycle(3/2017). What is the fate of all the lesser sentient True Energetic Selves (that now incarnate as backfill people,animals,plants and mineral entities)in our fourth evolutionary cycle,when we won't have a physical universe as part ofour fourth Multiverse any longer?

We are currently in the third evolutionary cycle.The first two cycles we've done.We have accelerated our ability to move through an evolutionary cycle very quickly actually.I can't tell you what it means in terms of years for how long we've been in this particular cycle,but I'm being told that we're moving at a speed,which is at least three times the speed of the last evolutionary cycle,which is at least three times the speed of the first evolutionary cycle. We're starting to move through an evolutionary cycle in a sort of logarithmic or exponential way where we'll start to move faster and faster and faster.An evolutionary cycle may take countless billions and trillions or quadrillions(a thousand trillion)of years to where our cycle can be a blink of an eye.We are moving through quite quickly. The True Energetic Selves from our human perspective will still remain in that function when we move into the next evolutionary cycle.Unless there are True Energetic Selves who are able to move up an evolutionary level,for instance,backfill people to human level or animals to backfill people,animals to human level,they will continue on their particular rise upwards.Now you may have thought that why wouldn't an animal go into a backfill person level,why wouldn't a plant go into an animal level,as a function of going through an evolutionary cycle? Well,it's not logical to do that,if you think about it,because the whole point of an evolutionary cycle is for the Source to disassociate its sentience from the body of energy that it is currently occupying within the Origin-the environments,frequencies and structure associated with that area of Origin within its area of polyomniscient sentient self- awareness-to another area and do it again.So we are trying to experience similar things,but in different locations. From a human perspective,we experience how to grow crops in the Arctic,then we experience how to grow crops in the tropical and then we experience how to grow crops in a desert,then we experience how to grow crops in a fertile land and then we experience how to grow crops in a semi-fertile land.It's just doing the similar things,but enduring and working with different environments. There may well be a different example of a physical universe in the next evolutionary cycle.I'm just going to ask the Source if that's part of the plan.It's told me that depending upon how we work,there may be another two evolutionary cycles or a maximum of twelve evolutionary cycles where we will have a physical universe.It's saying that's because it depends upon how it and the other Source Entities work with that particular area of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness that the Origin is allowing the Source Entities to work with. Depending upon how well we work with it rather than working with those or higher frequencies,we'll work with simply the subdimensional components and then dimensions and then zones,for example.Then maybe in later evolutionary cycles,we might even work with the subdimensional components,full dimensions and zones and continuums,for instance. There's a whole group of different levels of structure that are within the Origin that we've got to experience,learn and evolve through.If you go to The Orzgin Speaes,all the different structural components for this particular level of polyomniscient sentient awareness of the Origin is explained and laid out to explain what each of them is and what each of them does (4/2018) You told us that Source tried to "fix"them by increasing the volume of sentience in their True Energetic Selves before populating the third multiverse.But it didn't work,because the energies migrated back to their familiar TESs.What will happen in the fourth cycle? Things will stay as they are unless we move upwards in a quite radical way.They will remain as they are.They will move through another evolutionary cycle and the level of sentience I'm being told grows as a function of evolution.I'm just being shown an image what can happen. As a lower genre of True Energetic Self starts to evolve in a more dramatic way,it attracts energy to it that allows it to grow its sentience. The more energy you've got,the more sentience you can accrue.Now that sort of goes against a little bit the basic sort of 1 kilogram,for instance,of energy that's viewed as a standard body of energy. I'm being shown that this is a temporary condition.It allows the accrual of extra sentience to increase the quality of sentience.But eventually when that quality of sentience is properly absorbed or integrated with the first quality of sentience,it becomes a higher quality of sentience. Then the energies that were used to gather that sentience aren't required any more.They can break away and the sentience itself can also break away to another body of energy that's equal to the mass or the weight to the first body of sentience,so the quality of sentience increases whilst the body of energies that are required to house that sentience is per the standard.That's what I'm being shown here. So the standard energies can increase to attract levels of sentience as a result of how energy can create and can evolve in its own right.That's the difference between an entity and a being.An "entity"is a body of sentient energy that is individualized from Source.A "being"is one where sentience is a function of the evolutionary path of energies of similar or same type that group together to create rudimentary intelligence and then get bigger and bigger until they eventually become self-aware,have consciousness,are creative,and therefore, create sentience.It's a function of that process (4/2018). The reason I ask is because they are some of the most precious and beloved forms in our physical universe! Yes,but that's from a human perspective.When we are in the energetic,we don't see the physical universe as somewhere where we want to be.It's where we have to be to evolve,to accelerate our evolution.So our True Energetic Self,although they can work with the physical universe,they obviously reside where their evolutionary level is and their frequential level within the multiverse.The physical universe-other than being an evolutionary accelerant-isn't really of much interest to us(4/2018). In The Arne Dialogues you said a True Energetic Self can enter into the evolutionary cycle and elect to use aspects as guides while being outside of the cycle itself.Can a TES have two roles with one aspect incarnating in the evolutionary cycle and another aspect as a guide as well? At the start of the evolutionary cycle,a Source Entity populates an area of energy and structure of the Origin with its sentience.Then its sentience is given or commandeers a body of energy and decides what to do with that level of connectivity with Origin.Does it create an environment within itself?Does it make smaller units of itself?Does it not do any of that?Does it just sit there and think about how it's going to work?Does it just investigate parts of the Origin on its own?Or does it create something that is going to challenge it or challenge parts of it? When our Source started a new evolutionary cycle,it created a condition where half of itself was split out into a multiverse structure (which isn't all of its structure,but it's a vast majority of it)to allow other smaller,individualized units of itself that it created first (i.e.True Energetic Selves)to investigate that area. It then gave those TES the opportunity to enter into an evolutionary cycle themselves to become part of understanding the multiverse structure through individualized investigation or to help those who are going into the evolutionary cycle by being guides.In that instance, they would need to understand the possibilities associated with what can be interacted with and integrated with within that environment. The "aspects"here are simply True Energetic Selves.But it is possible in very rare conditions,where a TES may elect to have a little part of itself become part of the evolutionary cycle,but generally on a temporary basis.It's quite normal for the TES to become specialized in guidance or specialized in the evolutionary cycle. In general,this is the case,but there are times,when the TES may project an aspect of itself into the evolutionary cycle and it may stay there for a period of time just to see what's happening and how it works and how its own work is received.In general,they don't mix and match. But there are cases where guides become temporarily associated with the evolutionary cycle or where a guide may decide to go into the evolutionary cycle or in very rare cases where an incarnate entity or a TES moves out of the evolutionary cycle to become a guide.This requires a significant level of progression on behalf of the TES to go from the evolutionary cycle into the service part of things. On the other side,it's not detrimental for a TEs to have itself or part of itself to move out of the service (out of being a guide)to become part of the evolutionary cycle themselves.So in this instance,the TES can temporarily project a part of themselves into the evolutionary cycle whilst most of it can be still working in the service industry by being a guide. So sometimes a TES that is in the service side of things,like a guide or a master guide can project a part of itself into an evolutionary cycle and that evolutionary cycle doesn't affect it.Usually,it's a temporary thing. Sometimes the guides will project a part of themselves into the evolutionary cycle temporarily just to understand what the interaction with them is like on that level they're working on.They may dip into it and dip out of it.They will get a better understanding of how to advise, direct,lead or guide those aspects or TES that are in the evolutionary cycle.It's a bit like how can you guide somebody to do something,if you've not experienced it yourself? By understanding and experiencing this,they can then improve the way they communicate with their wards in the evolutionary cycle,so that they can make their incarnation more efficient(12/2018). In The History of God Byron said "time is finite,"because the Source decided we would all be together with the learning and experiences completed.Will the SE "graduate"all beings regardless of their personal growth?Or will Source force this to happen? This is to do with the evolutionary cycle.Eventually,all entities and beings will have experienced all aspects of the multiverse from an environmental,creativity,evolutionary and interactive perspective. When that happens,they will naturally commune with Source. Then Source will detach its sentience from the energies that it currently exists within and move its sentience within the polyomniscient sentient self-awareness area of the Origin.Source will repopulate a new area of energy with its sentience and then we start another evolutionary cycle. Then the True Energetic Selves that it has used previously may or may not be reindividualized to experience the new environment that it creates or doesn't create,as the case may be,within the next evolutionary cycle.Eventually,all entities and all beings will have evolved to the point of recommunion with Source(7/2019). In Bevond the Source,Book I the Source said,"I held my most precious creations back until I was satisfied the environment had a minimal level of structure before introducing you to it."Are we indeed God's most precious creations?Why? We are most precious,because we are part of the Source.Everything is part of the Source.But the"most precious"nomenclature refers to its sentience.We are individualized units of sentience.The "structure"is Source,True Energetic Self,Aspect,Shard.That's the structure.The precious creation is the individualization of Source Entity sentience and energy to create autonomous individualized units to interact with it in an environment that is created to experience,learn and evolve. When that creation of separation of sentience was being created,the Source wasn't particularly paying attention-to put it mildly-so different levels of sentience were associated with energies.That's why we get the human level or genre of sentience.We get the backfill level of sentience.We get the animal level,plant level and mineral level of sentience.All of them are precious,because it's Source Entity sentience. Don't forget that the Source is an individualization of Origin sentience, so you can see how precious we are.That's why we are the most precious,because we are individualized sentience of Source that is individualized from Origin (10/2019). At what frequency/universe do aspects return to when in the energetic?Same as where the True Energetic Self resides?Where do the TESs reside? Our TES reside in a frequency within the multiversal environment that is relevant to its overall evolutionary level.There are some aspects or souls who get stuck here,because they want to stay associated with the Earth.They would hang around the astral or spirituo-physical levels of the 4th,5th,6th and 7th frequency.We sometimes call them ghosts or other things,like a poltergeist,if they're observed.

But generally,when an aspect is not attached to the Earth,it will go back to an area that is close to the TES.It will definitely go back to the frequency that the TES is domiciled on.Depending upon what's going on with the aspect-whether it wants to stay or it needs to stay in a projected state-it will stay in that frequency associated with the TES. But it will not enter into one of the types of communion associated with merging the sentience and the energies back in with the TES. For instance,most people on Earth are around the high end of the fourth full dimension(FD),so that's where their TES is-for instance,in the 8th frequency of the 3rd subdimensional component of the fourth full dimension (or FB 116).But there are those in the third full dimension and others in the ith full dimension,but not many.Most people are in the fourth full dimension or the lower end of fourth/upper end of the third full dimension(1/2020). If every sentient entity is created by our Source,why would it create those in the evolutionary cycle that foul their environments physically and psychically,which then necessitates the creation of Curators to clean up the mess?Is it to enable free will? There's no desire for the Source to create an entity that is particularly hellbent on making a mess of things.It's a very advanced soul that decides to go into a difficult way of incarnating or experiencing interaction with the environment and move out of it.They choose a very difficult task.In reality,the souls that choose the difficult existences are the ones that evolve faster.They are the ones that are highly evolved,as are those who choose to be of service in some way. It's all to do with needing to experience every potential aspect of what is available to experience in the most profound detail possible.So the objective is being in a position where you make a mess of it and then recover from that mess.That mess might be recoverable in two or three lives'time.That's one way of experiencing it and evolving from it and doing that which other souls would shy away from,so some of these souls are really,really brave souls(1/2020). In Beyond The Source-Book 2 Source Entity 5 said,"No one entity will be tied to the SE that created it.They will all be free of the ties of their original environment.They will be equals with the Source Entities and the Origin."I can't conceive ofthis happening? This is a comment at the end of the first big group of evolutionary cycles that we'll go through that allows the Origin to go from this current area (or polyomniscient polysentient area of sentience and self-awareness),which is the first group of twelve levels of structure into the second group of twelve levels of structure. That second set of twelve will be so massively vast in comparison to the first set of twelve that there will need to be many,many entities that are of Source Entity level to be able to map it out,to help the Origin become more than it is.The statement "we'll all be equal to Origin"is sort of true,but not quite true. That's where everybody's TES will be closer to the Origin,because we become bigger entities as a result of our own evolution.Our 7s gains Source Entity status.Therefore,our evolutionary content has the capability of becoming much more than it was,as we start to become a larger sentient entity.We become more like the Origin,because we're closer to the Origin,because we've got a different status. But this is so far out into a different event space that it is almost inconceivable to understand and recognize that it's going to happen. But it will happen and it has happened-if you look at event space being everything happening concurrently.It's just a matter of understanding what we'll go to. The book called Beyond the Origin will discuss some of this and help us to understand a bit more about the projection of the Origin's structure and what that means to us in terms of what's going to happen later. When that book comes out,we'll start to understand a bit more about that statement.It will happen and as we move through our evolution, our evolutionary cycles get faster and faster and faster. Although it seems a long way away,actually the more evolutionary cycles we do,the faster those evolutionary cycles happen,so it's not as far away as one would think.It's just that when we think of it in human terms in a linear way,it seems to be a long,long way away (3/2020). In The Curators Source specifies the number of cycles that the Origin has left to experience in getting us to become Source Entities as "over one thousand million"as a ballpark figure.Since we're on cycle three, this seems unachievable?Am I understanding this correctly? When we are in the lower frequencies of the physical universe,which are the lowest frequencies associated with the multiverse within Source,we experience things in a completely different way to what we do normally when we're in the energetic. A whole lifetime-a lifetime of 120 years-is not even a blink of an eye in the energetic and it's already happened.These vast periods of existence are sort of arbitrary in real terms,because we've created a metric to measure the passage of events here.But when we're in the energetic,it's there.We can move from event to event,it's not an issue. When we go through an evolutionary cycle,we do learn and evolve- hence,the cycle moves on to the next cycle.As we move from one cycle to another cycle,everything that's been experienced in the previous cycle and all the evolutionary content and progression that's been accrued in the first cycle adds towards the ability to navigate through the next evolutionary cycle in a better,more robust,more efficient, more complete way. As we move through an evolutionary cycle,we start to accelerate faster.We go through one evolutionary cycle to the next and to the next to the next till eventually an evolutionary cycle will be not even a blink of an eye in comparison to so many million Earth years or trillion Earth years,for example.That's the thing to notice.As we go from one cycle to the next,things happen faster. In fact,we're just starting the third evolutionary cycle,but in comparison to the amount of "time"taken to experience the second cycle,we're shifting.We're really going really,really quickly in comparison.We're going at "warp speed,"to use a pun in the third evolutionary cycle compared to what we were doing in the first evolutionary cycle. As we move to the fourth cycle,when we get there,we'll progress and pass significantly faster than the third cycle.It seems like an unimaginably long period to go through,but it's eventually going to be extremely fast.That's the benefit of evolution(1/2021). If beings ultimately become entities,then does a Source Being become a Source Entity when the Origin moves into next area to map? Yes,everything becomes an entity,because they have the ability to create basically.A being has the ability to create anyway.A being can create an entity,but it's being transformed when it goes into the next level of polyomniscient sentient area of self-awareness-the next level of twelve levels of structure (beyond the current twelve levels of structure)of the Origin. Then the Origin is assigning them to that next level rather than reabsorbing them.In doing so,it changes their status from Being to Entity.There's a difference in the functional capability of a Being vs.an Entity.Read The Origin Speaks,which explains that.It might be explained in The Anne Dialogues as well. There's a definite difference in the functional ability between a being and an entity.But when we go into the next set of twelve levels of structure that the Origin is trying to make polyomniscient sentient area of self-awareness,then everything that's part of the first series of twelve levels of structure will become and is given or granted Entity status or beyond(1/2021).

### Nuclear War 

Visiting the old Titan II missile silos in Arizona really brought home the ever-present threat of thermonuclear war.Would an all out nuclear war be allowed by whatever cosmic powers there may be? Would an intervention occur to prevent such a catastrophe? My understanding is that we are being monitored.There are a number of different incarnate civilizations or respected entities from those civilizations who are observing what's going on here on behalf of those entities that are working with the Earth for prototyping individualized free will.If there was a condition where the Earth was going to be pretty much obliterated by an all out nuclear war,there would be intervention. Now whether we would see that intervention is a different thing, because intervention could be the manipulation of world leaders' thought processes to make them change their mind,to make them realize the errors of their ways and to make sure that the direction we're going into isn't invoked.It doesn't necessarily mean that all of a sudden we start to see thousands upon thousands of star ships in the sky.I'm not feeling that would be the case.It would be more of a subtle intervention. We're only going to be allowed to move out of the sphere of the Earth when we're more mature.When that occurs and we start to become higher frequency,then we will see those entities who are existing as incarnate entities or who can create something to allow us to work with them even though they are disincarnate.They can work with us on lower frequency energies,which are close enough to our incarnate energies. I very much feel that it would be a subtle intervention-one where there would be manipulation on those individuals who would be key individuals at the soul level to ensure that they would not be party to or invoke this level of atrocity that would happen worldwide.There's too much at stake basically. Even with the Fall of the Atlantean race,other races or civilizations that have been created through the use of the incarnate body before,there hasn't been this level of potential to damage the Earth. It's not about the human form as an incarnate vehicle to accelerate evolution,it's about the environment.The human form isn't an issue. They can all be removed by the use of some virus,for instance,if we were going to obliterate ourselves,because that wouldn't affect the rest of the eco-structure on the Earth. But to wipe out the eco-structure on the Earth wouldn't be allowed or tolerated.It would be more of a covert operation.Whilst answering this question,I was getting the information.I was quite surprised, because I knew that there would be intervention of some sort,but I was quite surprised that it would be very,very covert.I expected there to be some level of visible communication that we would all see that would make us all sort of sit and take notice.The objective of it being covert gives us a chance to be more in control of ourselves from the greater population's perspective(7/2016). In The Curators Source discussed nuclear warfare and said,"Incarnate mankind will evolve mentally soon to the point where this technology can be put to a much better and more benign use."What does "soon"mean? Soon means outside of my lifetime.I'm being told over a hundred years We're starting to understand more about how out of control we are with nuclear power.We think we're in control,but we're not.The various different problems we've had with Fukushima and Chernobyl are giving us an understanding that we don't really know how to contain this level of power. We've got lots of big machines that show we've got the technology to create these different conditions.But we're not making it very useful to us with individual,small nuclear generators rather than the big ones that create massive levels of electricity for cities or even for countries. When we start to understand it from a different level that we can contain it in smaller and smaller amounts rather than big amounts, then we'll be much more mature.But it's going to be over a hundred years before we can get there.I'm being shown there's going to be another two or maybe one minor catastrophe before we start to understand how we need to respect this level of technology,because right now we don't really respect it.We think we do,but we don't (5/2020). In The Curators you describe an alternate World War II Event Space where all forms of civilization have all but disappeared.My father fought in World War II.Is there a version of him that experienced all the destruction of atomic bombs and the beginning of the end of life on Earth?Did he ever exist in that reality? We all exist in all of the different versions of realities that we would potentially have made a decision to be part of.When we incarnate,we are in a position to make a decision,so we go from one particular place to another depending on what we want to do. For instance,if I get out of a bus and I turn right,I could have turned left or maybe gone straight on,if we were at another juncture.There's potentially one or two and maybe three or even four decisions that we can make.As we make one decision,we feel that our sentience ("consciousness")goes in that one way based on that one decision. But in reality with event space,it splits out and there's another parallel self version of us that goes in another way and another one goes into the third way.All of those individuals who choose to be in that particular event space also enter it,so we have duplicates or triplicates or quadruplicates of ourselves to potentially thousands of selves that are experiencing the thousands of different event spaces that are created individually and collectively and globally to experience all of the different variations. There are going to be variations where World War II didn't happen-all was sorted out and we lived in a completely different state of civilization and interaction with each other.In the decision process that led to no war,maybe Hitler didn't get to be chancellor of Germany or something else happened,so the war didn't happen.We do have a case where the war didn't happen,but other wars potentially happened later. To answer that question,yes,he was part of that and multiple other realities that are different variations upon that war unfortunately(1/2021).

### Om Beings 

The Om beings are smaller individualized units ofthe Origin.They are made of the "original material"that escaped during a recycling process and became independent beings.There are four types of Om that differ in their composition and ability to move around the Origin's area. As Om beings,are you and Anne each a whole soul aspect,not a composite hybrid,like Jesus? My late wife Anne or the aspect that was Anne-who I'm still in communication with even now-is an aspect of my True Energetic Self. I'm an aspect of her TES,so we're the same TES,which sort of made sense.It seems that as a being of a different energy type,we all have to behave and work with the same laws as everybody else that's incarnate. There's no special treatment at all.We are,as everybody else is,an aspect of our TES,which was created by mistake,as opposed to being created intentionally (3/2016). Do you have any famous past lives that we would recognize? I don't know of any famous past lives to be honest.I know I've had a couple of lives where I've had a sticky end.I've been hung,drawn and quartered in the 1400s.I've had someone I've worked with who turned against me-those sorts of things.Everything else is prehistorical stuff. I've been significantly let down.I've lost whole groups of individuals as a result,so I've had to work back on that,trying to recover the thoughts about being in a leadership position as a result of that betrayal. That's what happened there-people with lots of energy and power being used and lost and misinterpreted there.Nothing that you would recognize within human history context,because most of this happened in prehistory,so it's a very long,long way away in time. I'm not allowed to know much stuff,because it would distract me.I'm not even allowed to know of my own future,although I do get glimpses of it.People say what's going to happen tomorrow?What's going to happen next year?Or the year after?The answer is well,we can know, but at the end of the day,it would only distract us and stop us from working in the now. If we know that we're going to have various levels of responsibility and various things happening around us and we look at that now compared to then,all we see is this huge cliff face that we've got to go through to get to that point.We miss out.There are lots of little jobs that we've got to do to get us to that point.This little gradual curve that gets us up there may create panic.To spare us from panicking about doing all this work and being responsible for all these different things,we're allowed to do them slowly and without knowledge of the end product. Although we may know the end product,we sort of keep it in the background,so it's not too much of a distraction(3/2016). Do the Om beings incarnate in all parts of the physical universe at whatever level needs their attention?You said you have had 36 lives, but were those on Earth or in many places? The Om can be anywhere.Generally,the Om wouldn't be in the physical universe.If you look at The Origin Speaks,you'll see that some of them don't even want to be involved in creation,as it creates responsibility.Those who do incarnate-this is probably the hybrid Om or the captive Om rather than the noncaptive Om or other Om that can be outside of the structure of our Source Entity-could be anywhere basically. Those who are hybrid Om tend to be the same as every other entity that's created by Source.They will incarnate in all parts of the physical universe at whatever frequency they need to experience,learn and evolve.The same for captive Om.Noncaptive Om will do whatever they want to.They can incarnate in the physical universe or not,so it's up to them(12/2016). You said you have had 36 lives,but were those on Earth or in many places? My incarnations have been in various different parts of the physical universe.I'm told around 12 of those were on Earth.This is the 12th,so I've been in many different places within the physical universe usually in the higher frequency levels.They were as diverse as they needed to be,to be able to experience what I needed to experience(12/2016). Does Celia come from the same Om TES as you and Anne? Anne is part of my TEs and she was an aspect of that.My current partner(Celia)isn't.She is a very aware,very astute individual and very high in consciousness in her own right.But she's from a different TES. At the end of the day that doesn't matter,because we're all part of Source anyway.Even though we're potentially individualized from our TESs,whether those TESs are the same as another soul or not is immaterial,because those TESs are individualized functions of Source anyway.We're all One anyway,so it doesn't matter from that perspective(12/2016). I was wondering about the "attunement"that you had in Sweden.Do you know the ET/Divine race that gave it to you?Are you still in contact with them? Actually,I don't know the race and I don't have any contact with them, so I'm going to ask.I don't have a name for them,but I have a minor description of them.They appear to be a little bit of a mixture of mechanical and organic,a bit of higher frequency. They're not cyborg type,but they seem to be able to manipulate metals as well.When they create a form factor of some sort,they create it from whatever they need to,whether it's organic or element based,like metal based.I'm told they don't usually get involved with the Earth too much. They tend to only work with the Om,as being an advocate for the Om, so to speak.They're able to come closer to the Earth than the Om can normally without having to incarnate and the Om don't generally incarnate.In fact,the Om can't understand why I've incarnated to be honest but there we go.They do the work at various different physical levels in the physical universe on behalf of the Om. I don't have a real name,although I'm being told they're called the "Gratutnik"[gra-toot-nik]-whatever that means.Rather than an English word,that's like a sound or a frequency that's being used to describe them.I'm not in contact with them at all.When I was there,it took about five times for the attunements or top ups,fine tuning or calibration,if you want to call it that. But I've not really thought about them or been in communication with them since.I think that's because they've done their job and that's it. I've moved on and I'm doing what I'm doing(3/2018). Are there any other famous Om beings that we know from history, such as Paramahansa Yogananda?I think people would like to know about them,too. No,I didn't feel there were any more really.The Om don't want to incarnate full stop.Although I've been told I'm an Om and even though you are incarnate,you still have to follow the same rules as everybody else.I'm also told that the rest of the Om think I'm completely raving mad-why would I want to go into low frequencies?It's just so potentially addictive and karma creating,it would be a total distraction. So in general there aren't any Om that are famous individuals-pure Om that I'm talking about now. There are obviously hybrid Om who have become noteworthy in terms of the work done on the Earth and other environments within this physical universe.It's the same with captive Om. But in terms of non-captive Om,I'm not seeing anything there at all.I actually don't know of any.Perhaps maybe I'll do some meditation on it and see if I can pick out,if there is anything that shows other individuals or other leaders for both political and spiritual means who would stand out as being related to Om energy(5/2018). If the Origin and Source Entities laugh,do the Om laugh?What sort of things do they laugh about?What is the effect of the Origin's laugh on the Source Entities,Om and us? Well,if the Origin laughs,then we will all feel generally very enlightened and very happy.The same with the Source Entities.Do the Om laugh?Yes,they do laugh,I'm just being told.There are some Om that don't get involved with any form of evolutionary responsibility by the way.They don't get involved in creativity and they are very sterile Om.They don't interact with any others.They just experience the Origin.But they would also experience the Origin laughing. I'm being told that they are interested in this phenomenon-this interest in happiness or joy or delight-but they see it as being in some respects a waste of sentience,which I think is complete nonsense.But the Om that interact with other Source Entities do understand the concept and are appreciative of the concept of joyfulness,laughter, expression,happiness and joy.Things can be enjoyed in terms of when we create as well. I think these other Om still need to evolve a little bit and they're a bit too sterile at the moment.Even though they're the uncreated creations and they are not interacting with any other Om or being involved in the evolutionary cycle.They are subject to learning as well,the same as everybody else (7/2018). "Sentience"is the thinking,being,considering,creating,modifying, learning,understanding,evolving and progressing part of what we are."Pure thought"is one of the milestones on the road to sentience but cannot describe sentience.Does "sentience"equal Infinite Intelligence or Infinite Creativity? The Infinite Creativity and the analysis of Infinite Creativity is one way to think about sentience(2/2019). When you talk about a different "sentient weight"of Om or other beings,does weight equal "quality"or "purity?"Or are there other aspects to this "weight?" Sentient weight is a bit like saying qualityof sentience.It's the purity of sentience within the space or volume that the sentience exists within. It's a bit like how fine is the environment and how much content can you put in the environment depending upon what space is there and the frequencies and the energies that are there.That affects the quality of the sentience and the ability for the sentience to be productive or a major contributor from an evolutionary perspective. For example,if you have a general amount of sentience associated with a square meter and then you squash that into a square millimeter and then you put that quality of sentience back into a square meter,that sentience in the square millimeter will occupy all of the square millimeters associated with the square meter and you get a multiple condition of many thousands of times increase in the sentience within the same space(2/2019). Are hybrid Om still called "beloved of the Om?"Do they have any benefit of being a hybrid?Do they function differently from other hybrid beings?How? Hybrid Om are still considered to be "beloved of the Om,"but they are only classified as that,because they have a level of "Omness"associated with them.The Om energy is a function of the reuse ofenergy from the Origin in its experiment on recreating itself twelve times and then reusing that energy to create the Source Entities.Their function depends upon the weight of "Omness"or the amount of sentience that was part of the Original manifestation (or "Om"). If it's a small level of Om sentience,then it stays captive within the environment that is the Source Entity.The hybrid Om will mix with the energies associated with the Source Entity when it individualizes itself to create hybrid versions of True Energetic Selves.A hybrid Om has to exist within the structure of the Source. If it's a noncaptive Om,it can exist inside or outside of the Source Entity as a whole,spherical volume or weight of sentience,because it's not captive by the energies of a particular Source Entity.The only functional difference is that most hybrid Om incarnate in some way, shape or form,whereas true Om-captive Om,noncaptive Om or pure Om-don't need to incarnate or wouldn't normally choose to incarnate,because they're outside of the evolutionary cycle. But a hybrid Om would follow the same processes and same experiential path in an evolutionary cycle that every other entity created by a Source Entity would have to follow(2/2019). Is it common or rare for Origin to create Om beings by accident,so to speak? It's not common.It's something that happens by mistake really or by accident.I am not sure,if there's any other examples.I'm just going to ask the question.Well,I've just been told there are other so-called "Om"associated with other Source Entities.I'm not saying that it's rare,but it's part of the original creation of the Sources and the recycling of that energy it assigned as being a potential Origin itself. You could classify it as an accident or an error in the reuse of energy and it's rare.It's only happened once I'm being told when the Origin created the other Source Entities.It's not a common thing,but it is reasonably common,since there are a number of Om created that are associated with different Source Entities(3/2019). How many additional pure Oms now exist,such as yourself? I'm being told seven,isn't that interesting?There are seven additional pure Oms in this Source Entity (3/2019). Are highly evolved beings able to transit between Source Entities to broaden their experiences? Yes,provided they are Om.It tends to be the Om that are outside of the influence of a Source Entity who are able to take other Om outside of the Source Entity.The noncaptive Om can move a captive Om or a hybrid Om into the environment that is in another Source Entity's energies and sentience.That's the only way they can move from one Source Entity to another. They have to be helped out,because of the volume,mass or weight of sentience associated with that particular Om,so only Om can do that in general.You could classify the Oms as being highly evolved,but I wouldn't say that.I would just say that they are different energy (3/2019). It was surprising to find seven additional pure Om in our Source.How did that happen? There are seven additional pure Om in our Source Entity.I asked the SE how it happened.I received the information that these pure Om are not captive.You can be a noncaptive Om,which is pure in terms of its sentience and energy,but doesn't have its sentient weight to be able to move out of the energies of the Source Entity itself. Then there's pure Om that are noncaptive that can travel anywhere in the energy where the Source Entities are within the polyomniscient area of sentient self-awareness of the Origin.What I'm seeing is that some of these pure Om aren't created by Source,they just come and go. They can move into a Source Entity's energies and move out of it. That's what happened here. It's very easy to get confused,because they're within the Source,so easy to think that they've been created by the Source,but that's not the case.I'm seeing that these are Oms that moved around.They either move around,so they can go from one Source to the other. They can even move in other locations within this polyomniscient area of polysentience within the Origin.It's a big word,so I'm having difficulty saying it now.It's even more difficult to write it,when you write it in a book.They can move around,so they're sort of transient. They can come and go(4/2019). In The History ofGod Byron told you,"There are many Om working with the Earth and you are one of them."How many?Half a dozen? Thousands? Most of these are captive Om and hybrid Om,not pure Om.There are probably three dozen captive OM and thousands of hybrid Om with various different percentages of Om energy that is mixed with Source Entity energy.The noncaptive OM very rarely interact with the individuals on Earth.There are only a handful of pure Om.I'm of the pure Om,but I think I'm the maverick(7/2019). In The History ofGod Hum said you won't need him soon,as you will be able to communicate with any being/entity without guidance or backup.Have you reached that state to communicate with any being anywhere?Have you lost contact with Hum? Hum is the Om entity that was given to me as a guide to help me go further up the frequencies.I would say I know of Hum's existence still. I'm aware of Hum.Hum is helping other incarnate entities on this planet right now. But I can communicate with any entity I wish.Some of them are not so high frequency.Some of them are very,very high frequency and some of them are extremely evolved.These days I can do it whenever I want to,so the need to have the levels of long term deep meditation to get to the point where I can communicate with some of these entities is not necessary-not in the way it used to be when writing The Fistory of God. I don't need Hum any more,but I still think about Hum,like I think about Anne on a regular basis.I'm grateful for what he did for me. Although Hum is also an Om,there was no real need for it to come down the lower frequencies and put itself at risk of being addicted to lower frequencies to help me move forwards and lift me up the frequencies,so I can do what I'm doing now. I'm always grateful to Hum.I make a point of discussing an avatar that Hum has given me every time I do the Traversing The Frequencies workshops.Thank you for reminding me to verbally and positively thank Hum whilst doing a Satsanga for the work he's done with me (9/2019) In The Curators it said,"You are getting old."I find this and the assertion that you,"Mr.Om"have to experience all of the limitations of incarnate existence,every one of them,to be oddly comforting,as one tends to think of you as above all that? The only way to experience lower frequencies is to be incarnate.The only way to experience incarnation properly is to experience everything-everything everybody else does.The only individual who decided to walk away from that and still be here is Babaji.Even Yogananda said that you're here and you experience everything that everybody else does. If you're here and one was a somebody who was completely outside of everything,you would appear to be godlike and you'd be able to manifest things from nothing.You'd be able to cure illnesses.You'd be able to create technology.You'd be able to manipulate world financial systems.It would be unbalanced totally.It wouldn't allow the individual who was incarnate to experience incarnation in the lower frequencies in the way you're supposed to experience it. So that's what I'm experiencing and I have to experience everything in a balanced way.I've noticed now that I am experiencing things in a balanced way.That which was yin is now yang.That which was yang is now yin with me.I'm experiencing everything in the way that I'm supposed to in a very balanced way.The only way I can do that is to be in the environment of duality and the physical universe is that environment of duality(3/2020). In The Curators Source said,"You are not in the evolutionary cycle." Aren't you?I thought that's a fundamental part of being human? Apparently not.That's a fundamental part of being an aspect that we classify as being human.The human genre of TES and all of those TES that are incarnate in other vehicles around the physical universe are in the evolutionary cycle,but the Om aren't.Even when they meddle or incarnate,they are not part of the evolutionary cycle(5/2020). One time you said that Yogananda was a pure Om like you,but then you said it's not quite like that.What have you found out since you started writing the Om book? I haven't actually gotten anywhere near asking a question about Yogananda yet.What I'm going to do is put this as a potential question in the book called The Om:The Uncreated Creations. Right now I'm focusing on something as bizarre as quantum physics and how everything has everything else as part of it.Basically,every particle can be of every other particle and that's what I'm picking up now.Looking at things like quantum teleportation and that sort of stuff and understanding the reality behind it rather than what mankind thinks of how it works.You'll have to wait for that one unfortunately(7/2020). In The History ofGod you said "The God Collective"are entities that work with the Akashic Records.Source said:"You are part of them; they are called the Om...They created heaven on Earth...The Om,a Great Civilization?" This is about the Om and relates to The History of God,which was started to be written about 20 years ago,so it's quite old now(7/2020). Is giving the Om a special name or status (e.g.The God Collective, Beloved of the Om)just creating separation,hierarchy or vanity when ultimately we are all part of the Origin anyway?Our functions can and do change from one multiverse cycle to the next. Yes,they can and do change.What we have to realize is that when we're starting out things are simplified.The comment about "The God Collective"was when I was communicating with my TES(which is my Higher Self).We don't get taught quantum mathematics when we're trying to learn the times table.Things were being described in baby steps. Although there are certain differentiations of Om based upon their sentient quotient and whether they are captive Om or noncaptive Om or a hybrid Om,they're still classified as being Om.It's a little bit like having a number of different types of fruit-an apple,a pear,an orange, a mango or a banana,they've all got separate names,because they're all different things.But they're all classified as fruit.So the names are just to differentiate between the sentient quotient of each of the different types of Om(7/2020). How can the Om be a "great civilization"when they tend not to incarnate? Yes,the ones that incarnate are the hybrid Om quite clearly.The ones that don't incarnate tend to be the pure Om.There are one or two captive Om(who remain as Om because of their sentient quotient)who may incarnate.But the term "great civilization"was a figure of speech. It's saying that in general,when they are on their own,when they are disassociated from a Source Entity,they operate in a way,which is considered to be good for the collective,good for the Om in totality. They don't do anything that goes against or is detrimental to themselves as Om.That's a way we should think about the human race being a great civilization where every entity(or every incarnate human vehicle and the souls within)are working in general for the good of the population rather than for the good of themselves in a very selfish way. So it's only a figure of speech based upon the way they operate.A great civilization really is a human term.When communicating with the Source and the Origin,they tend to use humanization in terms of the way they operate.They communicate with me and,of course,they can communicate with others as well.We have to realize that some of these words are being used as descriptors.They may not be totally accurate, but they point us in the right direction(7/2020). How does the Om's Akashic Record function differ from that of the Curator entities called The Recorders? The Akashic Record is simply and only associated with incarnate mankind.There are other records associated with other incarnate vehicles around and within the physical universe at different frequency levels as well.Simply put,the Akashic is just the name for that one part of the structure of the Source's sentience,that memory that is associated with what we do on Earth.It's just one part,like a pigeon hole just for the Earth. The information created through Om interaction with Om or other incarnate aspects,whether they are hybrid Om or captive Om or anything else,that will be recorded within the Origin. But those who are captive or hybrid will be recorded in some function of the Source-bearing in mind that everything is Origin anyway,so it's just a different location. The memory associated with what we do,what every entity does-not just in the incarnate human vehicle,but all vehicles used in the physical universe and even in the rest of the multiverse-is associated with the Source.Only things that are outside of the Source are in another part of sentience associated with the memory of experience that the Origin has(7/2020). In The Origin Sveaks the Origin said it has no control over the om, because it did not"create"them.Can the Origin create/uncreate more Om?It said there is no plan to do it. The Om weren't created by the Origin.They were "uncreated,"if you want to call it that.They were created as a function of the reuse or recycling of energies that weren't wiped clean of their previous usage. The level of sentience associated with them is completely different. They became individualized because of reusing the energy to create something else that had a mixture of some of the Om energies and the sentience associated with it and another level of sentience and energy that was given purpose,which is the Source Entities. The Origin tells me that there's no need to create any more Om.The Om are like free radicals.They come and go and do what they want.The Origin is quite amused by this and allows them to get on with it, because it is interesting to see what they do.The vast majority of them are not part of the evolutionary cycle and don't want to be responsible for anything by creating it.But they're ultimately part of the Origin,so the Origin evolves as a result of what they do.It's quite happy to let them do what they do,but there's no plans to create thousands of Om (8/2020). The Origin did not "create"Source Being 1 either.Is SB1 a by-product of creation but in a different way?Does the Origin have control over it? Source Being 1 is a different thing.Ultimately,the Origin could control the Om,if it really,really wanted to.It could consolidate everything back into itself and start again.In The Origin Speaks the Origin said it has no control over the Om,but ultimately they are part of it. It's a bit like us as human beings having no control over ourselves,it's a similar sort of thing.The only way to try to gain control over ourselves would be to reinvent or recreate the body.So the Origin does have control over SB1 without a doubt,like its control over the Source Entities.That which is "uncreated"is a bit like a rogue self flying around the body.Where did you find it? The Origin can ultimately control the Om,if it wanted to completely reduce everything that was created into being just itself again,so it would just be a singular level of sentience and energy.But that would be like trying to find a quark within the human body,so it's difficult and controlling it is difficult. Think of it in those sort of ways.What I'm picking up from the Origin is that it's a way of saying,"Oh well,let them get on with it.They're too small to worry me or bother me,but they are interesting."It's thinking of it in those sorts of ways.It has no control over them,because it's not worried about having control over them (8/2020). In The Curators Source tells you that you are not in the evolutionary cycle,but of course,the rest of us all are.So no evolution for you,Mr. 0m? No,it's interesting,because a lot of the Om don't get involved in the evolutionary cycle.The way to not being involved in the evolutionary cycle is not to be involved in anything that creates things. Dolores Cannon was very good at identifying that people who are here to do a job that is above and beyond the normal role or life plan of an incarnate individual to experience,learn and evolve.They generally don't have things like children,because children are karmic.Children are karmic,because you've created something.You've created a responsibility for something. When we create something,we are responsible for it irrespective of what it is,where it is,what frequency it's in,what dimension it's in.So most of the Om don't get involved with anything that involves some form of creation.Sometimes we get stuck into it and we get involved with it without knowing.But in a lot of things,we are doing work and potentially it's for nothing. There are some Om that do enter into the evolutionary cycle.Even if an Om is incarnate and doing things,which could potentially create karma,they are not burdened by karma or burdened by anything associated with evolution.Now just because an entity is not in the evolutionary cycle,it doesn't mean they don't evolve. If you look at some of the Curators and certainly the guides and helpers who help souls to incarnate,they're not in the evolutionary cycle per se,but they do get evolution (evolutionary content)as a function of working with those entities who incarnate.It's given to them like a“tithe."It's shared. Although Om aren't in the evolutionary cycle,they do evolve.It's just that their evolution is not even automatic,it just happens as a function of just being with everything else evolving (1/2021). What happens to the Om when all the True Energetic Selves in our Source gain Source Entity status in their own right?Do the pure Om become "super pure"Om?Or do they not change their status,since they are not in the evolutionary cycle? They're interested in it,but they don't want to be involved with it. They're just interested to see how it works and how it affects those entities that are part of the evolutionary cycle.It's like watching somebody lie on a bed of nails. It's interesting to see how they cope with it,how they do it,what their strategy is,what their posture is,how long they can stay there,how sharp the nails are,how many nails there are there,what the population of nails is that allows the person to lie on the bed of nails?So it's a bit of a cursory interest. I'm not seeing any of them becoming "super Om."They just are as they are.I'm being told it's quite a unique condition where they will continue to be as they are.They will obviously gain evolution as a function of everybody else evolving.That's how they gain their evolution.As everything evolves,they evolve as well,because they're actually smaller individualized units of Origin that don't have a task. They are the "uncreated"creations.They just happened. I'm being told here they evolve as a function of everybody else evolving -in the same way that the Source evolves through its individualized units of sentience evolving through interacting with other things, doing their incarnations and experiencing the multiverse.As a function of the Source Entity evolving,so does the Origin.As a function of all these things evolving,so do the Om.But I'm not seeing them becoming "super Om,"just more expansive,more aware. I suppose you could call them "super Om,"but they're telling me they wouldn't call themselves that.They're saying that we just are and we evolve.We evolve as a function of others entering into the evolutionary cycle-just as all of the Curators do.They're saying that we just are.What we will do is expand with the expansion of the evolution as appropriate.That's interesting. They're basically just saying that we just expand with the expansion. We will always remain what we are irrespective of what becomes.But there will be synergy in terms of our expansiveness or beingness as a result of who and what we are and how things around us evolve as well (1/2021). Are the Om obtaining evolutionary gains or content from TES entities that incarnate via souls?Are we giving "tithes"to the Om like we do to our Guides and Helpers? Everything that interacts with everything or everybody that interacts with everybody else gains a level of evolutionary progression as a result of that interaction,because we all work with each other.That's the same for those hybrid Om or full (pure)Om who are incarnate as well. There's not many full Om.But in terms of the hybrids,they also gain evolutionary progression.Om don't normally interact or become part of the evolutionary cycle,because being part of the evolutionary cycle creates responsibility,so they tend to not be part of it. But as others who are part of the evolutionary cycle experience,learn and subsequently evolve,the whole environment evolves as well.So irrespective of whether an entity or a being is part of the evolutionary cycle,they benefit from the work that those entities who entered into the evolutionary cycle do. As with the guides and helpers,they benefit through the work that they're doing for their incarnate wards,so the Om would also benefit, but from a different directive.They would benefit,because the environment,which is the Source will benefit.The Source itself benefits.As the Source benefits,the Origin benefits. As the Origin benefits,everything that is the Origin benefits.The Om are ultimately part of the Origin,so they will benefit from the work that others do(2/2021). Is the Om's evolution passive and slower,since they have no function assigned to them by the Origin (or Source Entities)? I'm told that the Om are quite happy to go at the evolutionary pace of the environment.You could classify it as being passive.Rather than saying it's slower or encouraged or pressurized,it's just passive.It happens because it happens(2/2021). Is that why some of them (like you and Anne)incarnate among us to increase your experiential database? My understanding is that it was interesting to come here and experience what others are experiencing and to be of help or service in some way and to experience what being of service means.That's what I'm feeling about myself is to experience what being of service means and experience the joy of being of service. That's really what it's all about and being able to interact with individuals who are in the evolutionary cycle and see them struggle and succeed and do well or make wrong decisions and then right decisions is quite an interesting process to observe. Of course,as part of this process,we also as Om make wrong decisions as well sometimes or right decisions or optimal decisions or poor decisions or experience joy or experience concern,because that's what part of being in the human incarnate state is supposed to deliver (2/2021).

How big(in percentage)is our Source compared to the Origin? I can only give you an idea.It's only an idea for me as well based upon the first group of twelve structures within the Origin's current volume of polyomniscient sentient self-awareness. Think of the Sources being about the same size as a grain of sand in,let's say,the universe as a maximum size.It might even be down to a new size actually.They are unbelievably small.We think they're quite large, but in terms of the structure that they are part of,it's really,really small.So then it's like everything is protracted,made much smaller, because the Origin has 12 sets of 12 levels of structure. The Source Entities are only created to four levels of the first 12 sets of structure,so you've got eight levels above the highest structural component of a Source Entity.In a percentage,it's like one grain of sand in all the sandy beaches in all the planets and all the frequencies in the physical universe at the biggest.They are infinitesimally small and we're even smaller(2/2021). How is the Om's energetic signature different from the Origin?Are they similar? In essence,it's the same,because the Om are individualized units of the Origin.But they're unintentional individualized units,so therefore, you could classify them as mini-Origins,although that's probably a bit preposterous.They are smaller individualized units of Origin,so they are pure Origin,but they are individualized as a function of the reuse of that energy that hadn't been reassigned properly. It's preprogrammed Origin energy that was used with other reprogrammed energies to create the Source Entities,but it didn't mix, because it had a different level of understanding of what it was.So that which was previously used to create the Twelve Origin experiment stayed as Origin.It didn't mix to become Twelve Source Entities,so it's the same.But of course,they have different experiences and that demarcates or differentiates between that which is Origin in totality and that which are smaller individualized units of Origin that are uncreated as part of creation.They are the uncreated creations (3/2021). Is there anything "uncreated"besides the Om as a result of the Origin's first experiment of recreating itself?What sort of things are“uncreated?u My understanding is that the Om are the only "uncreated creations." Everything else had a purose behind it.The Om were created as a function of reused or recycled sentience that wasn't reassigned away from being an Origin.Rather than becoming individualized as a Source Entity and its other functions,it detached itself from the assignation of a Source Entity,because it saw itself as being Origin. But it also saw itself as being individualized.That's why the Om became individualized aspects of Origin sentience.Only the Om are uncreated. They weren't intentionally created as Om,it just happened.They were uncreated.Maybe the word"uncreated"is wrong.They were a bit of an accident.But if you refer to these entities as being "the accident,"that might not go down too well. Just think of it as being a byproduct of the creative process where the sentience and the energy that was used to create the Source Entities wasn't reassigned properly(6/2021). If someone asked the Om beings to interact with them,would they or are they observers only?Or do they not really even observe incarnate life,as it doesn't really pertain to them? The Om don't really like getting involved with anything that's part of the evolutionary cycle.They see it as a restriction.They see it as stopping them being what they are,which is basically individualized pure Origin sentience albeit smaller versions of it. There's a book I'm writing now,which is my channeled work working with the Om.They don't really want to be here.The fact that there's a couple of pure Om that have been here is a very rare occurrence. Usually,the Om here are hybrid Om with a very low percentage of sentience associated with the Om. You do get hybrid Om and hybrid Source Entity energy or souls that have True Energetic Selves like that with a different percentage of sentience that is not one type of sentience or another.For instance,it could be sort of 78%Source Entity sentience and 22%of the Origin sentience that was not reassigned as Source Entity sentience,so that ended up being Om sentience. Then there's the higher levels of Om volume,which create the noncaptive and captive Om,which are part of or captive within the energies of the Source,but still individualized and don't incarnate. Or you've got those that are outside of the Source that do move around by the Sources.You've got the pure Om,which don't want to be involved at all in general.If they do get involved or if one of them wants to experience something,they are aghast to be quite honest and want to persuade that other Om to move out of those frequencies and as soon as possible. It is very unlikely that an individual will be able to interact with Om, because there are not many of them,certainly not the pure ones.They might have more chance of communicating with a captive Om or a hybrid Om.There's more chance of that than there are the noncaptive Om or the pure Om. Although they have interacted at some points with certain types of Om that have interacted with the Earth and assisted or directed certain civilizations,most of the pure Om won't be interested in this type of work at all.They have a different function,which is to be themselves rather than to be involved with any form of evolutionary content or creativity that creates responsibility. They want to move out of the possibility that creates a responsibility or that may even bring them into the evolutionary cycle.They do evolve, of course,because they are in effect sentience that is individualized, but not by design from the Origin.In effect,they are stray Origin sentience or random free radicals,as I call them. But they are just simply,let's call it,unfocused Origin sentience- meaning it's not sentience in one particular volume in one location. They move around like dust specks on the air within the atmosphere. That's the best way to describe it.The Om are part of the atmosphere, but they're their own sort of being,so to speak(9/2021). Are captive Om happy for being captive or do they wish to become noncaptive Om? I'm being told that the captive Om are happy with their status,which is created as a function of their quality of sentience that's apportioned to them.They're quite happy with what they are. At some point,when the Source finishes its evolutionary cycle and starts to move into a different location within the Origin,they will be given the same capability potentially. When all of the evolutionary cycles of all these Source Entities and even the Origin has resulted in mapping all of the structure of the Origin in this first group of twelve structures,then they will potentially be noncaptive.They understand this,because they can see the bigger picture.They see that what they're doing is benefiting and that's the way forwards(11/2021).
