## Foreword 

This book was started on a journey to China to hold intensive Traversing the Frequencies(TTF)and Psychic Shield (PS)workshops plus a taster to my healing workshop Psycho-Spiritual Healing (PSH)in December 2019.I didn't intend to start it at this time because I was supposed to be having a break after finishing the book on Psycho-Spiritual Healing(PSH,but may be called Psycho-Spiritual Alignment and Reprogramming [PsAR]in China),my eighth.However,when one has looked at all of the inflight entertainment and exhausted the possibilities of reasonable program that one may be interested in,one's mind always wanders back to getting on with the next piece of work. This book is dedicated to The OM and is intended to gain as much information about these rather rare entities as possible.What makes them rare?you may ask.Well,simply put,they are the only entities,as far as I am aware,that have not been specifically created by another entity,or being,in order to support a desire to experience,learn,and evolve. Indeed,they do not specifically have a direction from any entity or being and this includes The Origin.Furthermore,the only other entity that wasn't specifically created was The Origin,which is,by definition,a being.Please see the glossary of terms at the back of the book for the descriptions of what makes an entity an entity and what makes a being a being. Even as I say this though,I am concerned that,as a result of the intervention/ interaction of Event Space in the earlier period in the existence of the developing sentience that was destined to be The Origin,it could actually be classified as an entity.Event Space would have had to be fully sentient to have achieved responsibility for the creation of The Origin,which,when I look back at the previous communications,it was not,so I suppose that answers that question-maybe! I have to admit that I am eager to commune with The OM and Anne,who is also beloved of The OM and is part of my OM True Energetic Self(TES).I find myself quite excited about the prospect! Over the years and the channeled works that have become books there have been a number of times when The OM were discussed,with the result of new information about them being presented to me.During these times I made a mental note to go back to these communications and use them as a springboard to gain a deeper understanding of the information and as a possibility to go in different directions to broaden the knowledge about The OM as well as deepen it.On top of this,I have already compiled a list of questions that I expect my readers would like me to ask as "headings"for discussion with The OM. One of the things that really intrigues me are those OM that choose not to be responsible for anything and as a result choose not to create or even participate in any form of evolutionary gain,being fully independent of the desires of The Origin,even though they are essentially individualized units of Origin sentience.I later call these the disconnected or disassociated OM. Then there is Hum,dear Hum,that OM who was "assigned"to me.It was to assist in my ability to traverse those frequencies above those of the incarnate human vehicle and later traverse all frequencies within The Source's multiverse and beyond into those frequencies, that structure,that was Beyond The Source and into the sentient energies of The Origin allowing me to commune with the other Source Entities.The Beyond The Source books were,I now know,a test of my abilities to continue to go beyond-and then go further.My intuition tells me that this will be important in both this and the next book. The OM continue to be a mystery simply because they are an anomaly in the normal scheme of the much greater reality,and all I can hope to do is remove a small part of that mystery as I work through the communication I have as a beloved member of The OM. Many people ask me the difference between those Aspects from TES that have been created by The Source and an OM.Simply put,while incarnate there is no difference;we/ The OM abide by the same constrictions associated with existence in a low-frequency environment while in the incarnate state,although there are some communicative benefits, should one recognize them.I will let you know when I notice a few more than those I use, which are not many. In finishing,before commencing the task at hand I would like to suggest that I will gain as much information about The OM that incarnate mankind can assimilate,not of course discounting myself.Notice I didn't say "work with"for this would imply understanding, which to be honest none of us can achieve in this incarnate state.However,we are expansive enough to gain knowledge from any communication with The OM,further noting that that which we can understand is designed to be understandable. In order to assist in understanding the knowledge that will unfold during my dialogue with The OM I have included a glossary of terms that have developed as a function of my previous dialogues and books.New terms that have arisen from the dialogues that will create this book will also be included in the glossary,but they will be in italics. I hope you are in the same state of anticipation as me,dear reader,for I anticipate a real metaphysical treat! Guy Steven Needler 23 December 2019

## Reconnecting 

Physical existence had taken over since writing the introduction to this book on the flight to China in December 2019.Although this physical work included a significant amount of spiritual work,writing the online content for a healing workshop that was due to be piloted in China for example,it meant that work on The OM:The Uncreated Creations was temporarily put on the back burner.China,I note,was proving to be a big spiritual opportunity,one which had a resultant workload associated with it,one that I had intuition about for some years but shied away from. My mind focused on the task at hand,reconnecting with The OM.I was not surprised to hear a familiar voice in my head as the first official contact with The OM since working with Hum. I do have to say that it feels very good to be sitting in front of my computer working on the next,the ninth book.I gain a sense of freedom from it this time,a kind of comfort- strange!It could be because I am about to communicate with that which I am,that I will be taking to my counterparts at home!!! ANNE:Heeellllooo!It's me! It appeared that Anne had decided that she/it was to be my first contact with The OM.

ME:It's nice to speak to you again. ANNE:It's not the first time that we have spoken since The Curators,The Anne Dialogues,or the book on Psycho-Spiritual Healing.In fact,we have spoken often. ME:It has been about trivial stuff though. ANNE:There is nothing that can be classified as trivial that does not have meaning behind it. ME:I accept that.I just mean that I don't give it the same level of importance as the work we do to broadcast the information about the greater reality. ANNE:Such as writing the books? ME:Such as writing the books. ANNE:Who do you think planted the desire in the right people to make you interested in making a workshop out of Psycho-Spiritual Healing? ME:Ah!I knew there was something or someone in the background that made the publication of the book in China turn into a workshop instead-the change in direction was made very compelling. ANNE:It is my job to make sure that that which is in the plan comes into fruition. ME:And that is why you are where you are now and why I am here now. ANNE:That's right. ME:OK,so how is this going to work? ANNE:There are many things to talk about and you have been given some of the subjects that we will discuss.I do note,though,that there are a few that will appear to be off-piste and as a result will be introduced as we progress. Not everything that will be discussed is going to be about The OM.Some of it will be information that The OM choose to give you. ME:So,who is with you now?Who is going to interact with me? ANNE:I will,as will Hum when appropriate,but a lot of the dialogue will come from The OM collectively,that being,those OM that we are "beloved of." ME:All of The OM? ANNE:No,those OM TES that we are beloved of. ME:How many OM TES are we beloved of? OM:Seven.We are in total seven together and you are two of one of the seven.The seven are what you call TES but we are OM. ANNE:There you have it. ME:I guess that I/we are part of the same TES.This I/we,my readers know. For you,dear reader. To describe us as OM,then,we are two Aspects from the same OM TES.The OM describe themselves in terms of TES rather than the Aspects from their TES if they project them.They collectively refer to their TES as OM.The group of or a group of "OM" TES are referred to as being beloved of The OM. ANNE:Being beloved of The OM has more meanings,though. ME:Go on. ANNE:Being beloved of The OM means that an OM TES or its projected Aspect/s are beloved of the group of OM that it associates itself with.The group of OM,in our case containing seven TES,are beloved of The OM in total.That means all of The OM groups that are within and without the eleven Source Entities currently in the first aspect of Origin structure [the first group of twelve levels in another group of twelve groups;see The Origin Speaks-GSN]you call its Polyomnipresent area(volume)of Polyomniscience. This includes those OM groups and those that are singular OM that do not associate themselves with a Source Entity.The twelfth Source Entity,SE12,does not have any OM associated with it as you know.It also includes those that do not associate themselves with the evolutionary process.All OM are beloved of The OM! ME:Any association with The OM is beloved then? A OM Together:Yes! A OM Together:ALL and One OM are one and are beloved. ME:Being beloved of The OM is both a singular and a collective term then? A OM Together:Yes! I noticed myself saying this as well!!! ME:Hold on a moment.We seem to be all together as one. A OM Together:We are as one! ME:Yes,I know but I wanted to communicate with Anne separately,to Hum separately,to the group of OM that I/we are part of separately.I haven't even reconnected with Hum yet. HUM:But I/we are here together beloved as one,beloved of The OM! A OM Together:But we/it/Hum/Anne are here together,beloved as one,beloved of The OM!

ME:OK,my mind is already spinning Can I make a request? ANNE OM Together:You may. ME:Can we make the following rules in communication? 1.When it's the Aspect of The OM TES that I belong to,Anne,that communicates that it is singularly represented as ANNE. 2.When it's the TES of The OM group that I belong to,Hum,that communicates that it is singularly represented as Hum.

3.When it's the group of OM TES that I belong to,OM,that communicates that it is collectively represented as OM. 4.When,and if,it's ALL OM communicating to me collectively that it is represented as ALL OM. ANNE HUM OM ALL OM:YES,I/it/we/we all CAN!ME:Now we can get somewhere! ANNE:You really are difficult to work with in that human suit! ME:I know,I know!

## How The OM Became 

How The OM were created,or should I say uncreated,is,I feel,explained in enough detail in The Origin Speaks.However,for those readers who have not read The Origin Speaks I will summarize. The Origin,having realized that it wasn't able to recreate itself once,let alone twelve times,also realized that the failure to create twelve copies of itself was due to not understanding itself,specifically in terms of its own magnitude.This led to the creation of twelve smaller and quantifiable "Source"Entities.In order to do this,it reused the sentience and energy that it used (individualized from itself)to create the twelve Origins and reassigned the sentience and energy into smaller groups of sentient energy.It allowed them to become self-aware on their own and then connected (communed)with them to advise them of their reason for existence. How can anything recreate that which it is if it doesn't know what it is in the first place?you may ask.Indeed,this is a question The Origin recognizes that it didn't ask before starting its experiment-the creation of twelve versions of itself. This was the dilemma that it was presented with and is presented with.In essence, and in hindsight,The Origin could only reproduce itself when it had fully understood ALL that IT was on all twelve major levels of its structure.That each major level had twelve minor levels of structure associated with it.And that right now it was only working on understanding the first group of twelve levels within the first major level of structure.

This structure is described in short in The Origin Speaks as The Origin's volume of polyomnipresent,polyomniscient self-awareness,and everything that comprises the structure of our Source Entity (SE1)is within the first four levels of the first twelve minor levels of structure,the multiverse we exist within being within the first three.Each level of structure represents an X12 increase in finitude and environmental content from the previous or level below it.This X12 increase is a constant that is throughout The Origin's structure that it is aware of,but not yet in full understanding of,and that which it is semi- aware or even not aware of,but realizes must exist.By the time The Origin had worked this out,moved on from its point of "so-called"failure,and created the twelve Source Entities,it had also recognized that it could never faithfully reproduce itself.It was "one on its own,"it was "The Origin"and that was that. After the failure of the twelve Origins creation,such was the urgency in its desire to create The Source Entities to accelerate its evolutionary progression that it forgot to ensure that the combination of sentience and energy that it used to create The Source Entities was fully reassigned as such.How could The Origin forget to totally reprogram/reassign its sentience and energy from one role to the new role?you may ask.The answer is simple.The Origin was,and still is,extremely young and as a result is experiencing,learning,and evolving,just as we,as creations of our Source Entity,SE1,are!As a result,it can make simple mistakes or errors.These errors meant that,in the case of the creation of the twelve Source Entities,some of the sentient energy was still wholly Origin!Being wholly Origin sentience and energy meant that it was still Origin and as such capable of becoming instantaneously individualized and unintentionally created at the same time as being unassociated with that which any other sentient energy that had the purpose of being anything other than Origin sentience.Provided that is,that there is enough sentient weight to support its individuality. I remember The Origin describing the creation of The OM in The Origin Speaks. O:The OM energy was unevenly distributed among the pure Source Entity energy.It was in globules of OM energy,so to speak.These globules remained singular,individualized aspects of OM energy and did not group together.As soon as my intention to keep all of the energies together was removed,they very quickly separated themselves out from The Source Entity energies that they found themselves part of.Those that had enough mass naturally sensed that they were not of the same quality of energy and moved back into the energies that they sensed were their own-the energies being those which are part of my area of self- awareness.Simply put,they moved back to the place from whence they came!The mass of OM energy and the level of sentience attached to those individual masses dictated how The OM are currently represented within me.The result was the generation of the Pure OM,Non-captive OM,Captive OM,and Source Entity/OM Hybrid,the hybrid of which have varying percentages of mix [see later-GSNJ.The quality of the energies that are OM ensured that their level of sentience increased at a rapid rate.Apart from the energies that resulted in The Source Entity/OM Hybrid energies,and much later,other individualized entities created by The Sources for their own evolutionary tasks,all other OM were able to detect each other no matter where they were and within or without which Source Entity they are or were part of. The OM are,in general,but specifically in the case of the Pure OM,individualized units of me.As each of The OM sought each other out they noticed that their interaction with each other rapidly increased the level of their sentience.At the same time,they also noted that they were not all the same in terms of their mass and ability to relocate themselves.Working together,understanding what each of them "was"from an energetic and sentience perspective created a high level of camaraderie within The OM.During this interaction they recognized how special they all were in terms of the noncreativity process that resulted in their creation coming into effect.They noted their limited numbers and loved being in each other's company. They all fell in love with each and every one of themselves and became beloved as a group of entities as a result-hence the term being"beloved of The OM."The OM's ability to experience, learn,and evolve was and is a joy to behold.They have a capacity for evolution that is only equal to a Source Entity,and,noting how much larger than an OM a Source Entity is,this is the most wonderful piece of noncreation I have ever experienced.There is one issue with The OM,though,and it is this.They are,to all intents and purposes,me,smaller individualized versions of me,and because they were not created for a specific purpose,they have fully autonomous individualized free will.Because they are essentially me I cannot and do not control them.They do what they want,wherever they want to do it because they do not have a framework within which to work. ME:This sentient weight,or lack of it in some instances then,has resulted in the genres of OM illustrated below,starting with the lowest level of Origin sentience and therefore the possibility of amalgamating Source Entity sentience and energy with The Origin sentience and energy.Note that the necessary percentage of Origin sentience required to make an individualized OM is 70 percent of that required to make a Pure OM.Seventy percent of the sentience and energy of a Pure OM created a Non-captive OM.Sixty- five percent,a drop of only 5 percent,results in the creation of a Captive OM.There is a big gap after that as the percentage of OM sentience needs to be below 15 percent to allow the amalgamation of Source Entity sentience and OM sentience.This is because the percentage of OM sentience to Source Entity sentience and their associated energies needs to be in excess of a 5:1 ratio. HUM:It looks like you are understanding the way to tap into the information about The OM without the rest of us being involved. ME:Hum,what,how...?Oh!of course,you were always there HUM:Of course.Even though you have not communicated with me directly for over sixteen years of incarnate existence,and even though you assigned my help to another incarnate,I have always been close to you,all OM are.We are interested in seeing what you do,how you do it,and how incarnate existence affects you.You have been affected by the trend in low frequencies and although you know this,you still work with both the low and the high frequencies.This,we as OM,are interested in. We would like you to continue if you would. ME:Thank you. HUM:Bearing in mind that The Origin has already described the anatomy of what we are,it would be useful for you to add to the previous knowledge. Anatomy of an OM-and a Bit More ME:Thank you,Hum.I will do my best,although I do have to say that most of what The Origin said will be used in this description with only that which is necessary used to fill in the gaps.Here we go then. The Hybrid OM are those that have the lowest percentage of sentience,less than 15 percent of the 100 percent enjoyed by the Pure OM.Although they can and do incarnate, they are not aware of their sentient and energetic heritage.They are mostly derived from the associated energy of The Source with the percentage of OM sentience amalgamated within it.When in the energetic they are mainly energy without structure.That is, they do not have the structure associated with The Original energetic structure of The Origin.When considering them as Hybrid OM outside of the environment created by their originating Source Entity,they adopt the structure given to them by their creator and are therefore the same as any of the entities created by a particular Source Entity. Their structure is derived rather than inherited,i.e.,their structure is created by their Source Entity and not by their OM heritage simply because they are mostly Source Entity sentience and energy The Captive OM have a percentage of OM sentience that is no less than 30 percent of the Pure OM.The Non-captive OM have some structure;however,they are limited to the structure of the environment that they find themselves within.That can be one of two variants:the structure of The Source Entity they are captive within,or just the structure that their Source Entity created for their entities to work and evolve within.Source Entities have a maximum structural condition equal to four levels,"Frequency"through to "Zone,"and Captive OM assume the same.Their structure is not derived,or inherited,it is assimilated by exposure to their surrounding environment.

The Non-captive OM are a version of the Captive OM but with the advantage of having more energetic/sentient density or weight than the Captive OM,hence,their being Non- captive.They generally have a minimum of 51 percent of that of a Pure OM.This gives them the ability to be divorced from the association with a Source Entity while still being able to enter into,and out of,their energies.They assume the same structure as The Source Entity they were supposed to be a part of,when the energies The Origin recycled were reassigned to create The Source Entities in totality. The New Version of The OM,those five OM that are currently under integration energetically,will have nine levels of structure when they finish their process of attraction and become five OM rather than OM "dust,"so to speak-this being,“Frequency”through to“Totality.”The Origin calls them The Intermediate OM. There is expected to be a big leap structurally from the Non-captive variant to the Intermediate variant.It is one that should not be ignored,for these OM will be important later on in The Origin's existence.[See The Origin Speaks-GSN] The Pure OM,of course,have the lion's share of the structure and sentient density/ weight for they are 100 percent Origin sentience and energy.They have all of the structural characteristics of The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient sentient self- awareness.It is this reason that they can,and do,have full independence within The Origin and are able to traverse all structural conditions within its volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness,without hindrance or resistance.They can move around The Origin by becoming part of it and transferring their very essence throughout the structure that they are,or that is within The Origin.What's more,they can span the structure that is The Origin either in totality throughout it,based upon their own density,of which is a limitation only in their ability to maintain their own integrity,or they can span The Origin's structure in a linear fashion,spreading themselves in one direction only,a straight line,so to speak,from "Frequency"through to "Margin." A Pure OM could,should it so wish,create its own Source Entities or entities of similar ability within its own structures,or indeed within The Origin's own structure, such is the level of their inherited power/functionality.None to date has taken up this opportunity,however,and as stated in a previous dialogue [see The Origin Speaks-GSN], a large number have elected to not be part of the creation process because it creates responsibility for that which is created and therefore inhibits full independence. Pure OM have the ability to separate out the detail of their structure and create a multiple focus of their attention to each aspect they separate out into.In essence they can position that part of themselves that is frequency based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness that is frequency based,that part of themselves that is subdimensionally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness that is subdimensionally based,that part of themselves that is dimensionally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness that is dimensionally based and that part of themselves that is zonally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness that is zonally based,etc.,etc.,right up to the margins,the final structural component within The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.

The OM are capable of many things,one of them,certainly with the Pure OM,being the capability of operating outside Event Space.We will discuss this later. The Pure and Non-captive OM are independent of The Origin,the Pure OM more so. The Non-captive are limited in some respects to staying within the location of The Source Entity their energies were ejected/rejected from during the time when The Source Entities were discovering more about themselves through "play."Because the energies the Pure OM were inevitably formed from was pure Origin energy it allows them to be both part of The Origin while being independent of it,which includes the functions of being fully separate to being fully integrated and any level of this in between.They are truly versatile in this manner.Captive OM and Hybrid OM are not independent of The Origin because of their closer association with a Source Entity.Although,Captive OM can operate in an independent fashion within the environment that is The Source Entity they are captive within. In essence the Pure OM are smaller versions of The Origin.They are the energy that was used with the intention to create another Origin,hence their full independence,for that was part of the programming of the energies assigned to be an Origin. The Origin has no control over the Pure OM.Although,in reality it could recycle the energies that are OM in general,reintegrating them back into the base energies of its area of Polyomniscient volume of sentient self-awareness.The Origin,however, does not wish to do this,and it would have little to no success with the Pure OM. The Origin,in its wisdom,sees The OM as an interesting and delightful micro version of itself and one that could have interesting connotations in terms of its own progression.

The Pure OM are me within The Origin,they are fragments of Origin sentience. When The Origin created the intention to develop,to evolve in parallel,and thought of the possibility of the creation of twelve versions of itself,it didn't actually create twelve versions per se;it split off twelve segments of its sentient energies and removed the memories of being The Origin from them.The energies used in the Twelve Origins' strategy weren't created either;they were just reassigned and relocated,and later,upon the failure of the strategy,they were recycled or reassimilated.The OM energy is also uncreated because it is this same energy.Origin energy that is assigned as Origin energy stays as such,so when the time came to be reassigned as Source Entity energy it rejected the assignation and stayed as it is,Origin energy.However,because it was distributed in an unequal way with the energies that were being assigned as Source Entity energy,that inequality resulted in the creation of the different types of OM. There is something else though that has an important impact on why The OM are The OM.This is because their previous assignation remained as Origin energy with Origin functionality-so being mixed with energies that were assigned as a lesser function and because The Source Entities were located within The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness and given a purpose,the energies would not have mixed in harmony anyway.So,Origin energy,when of the correct density or weight,became independent sentient entities of Origin energy when released from The Origin's holding and creating energies.They could not be created because they were already in it,but in the previous programming of their energies still in place they became sentient and individualized with all of the functions of a smaller version of The Origin,within it, instantaneously. The OM,being a smaller version of The Origin,has a microstructure.That is,it is a representation of that which is The Origin within its volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.That being,they are similar to The Source Entities,which have a sentient self-aware energy with an individualized structure of a level that allows an environment to be present within them,should they wish to segmentate themselves in this way. The OM are limited to that structure which "is"The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.They have no structure beyond that.But,in this "limited" structure they are more structured than any of The Source Entities either individually or together.The reason for this being the multiplication of the structure represented by the different levels,the twelve levels,by a factor of twelve each time.A Source Entity is limited to four levels;that is,frequency,subdimension,full dimension,and zone.This is why The OM can operate within the structure of The Origin and are limited to the structure of its volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness.Beyond that they have no structure and therefore are not in the category of "all there is." The Origin thinks of The OM as being free agents.A free radical in the literal translation of the words-free as in not being under its control or answerable to it, and radical meaning that they are not constrained by its demands and can therefore do anything they want either inside or outside the demands The Origin made of The Source Entities,for example. It could be suggested that The Origin has no control over The OM because it did not create them,so in theory it cannot recycle their energy,it cannot uncreate them.The Origin should be able to start from scratch in everything it does or has done because it created it.In the case of The OM though,they were a byproduct of a creative intention,not the actual creation arising from a creative intention. The Origin also considers The OM as special:this is because they were unintentional and as a result they are unique.Because The OM are not constrained by the convention of The Origin's creativity,desires,and thought processes,they are able,should they so wish to do so,to perform a function within it that would,for the want of a better word,be adverse to its strategic plans for personal evolutionary progression.They can do that which is both unwanted and unexpected in light of The Origin's evolutionary progression. When an OM decides that it will not enter into the evolutionary cycle through the use of creativity,it is a choice that approximately half of the Pure OM have chosen as their path.This is because they know that creativity creates responsibility,for that which they have created,and have responsibility for,ties an OM down.

## The New OM-a Minor Taster 

The OM are special.They are not only rare,they are unique.That is,insomuch as The Origin did not create them,they were/are a byproduct of creativity.At the point of channeling The Origin Speaks,it had not discovered them all-yet,even though it noticed their energy signature winking into existence during the creation of The Source Entities. These new OM were perceived as a small number of dust particles spread out within the infinite volume of The Origin.Each particle represented a single OM.At the point of channeling The Origin Speaks they were described as a finer level of dust,dust within the dust.It was almost like each particle of dust was itself created by a smaller more compact dust.This was a level of OM that was collectively unified-that being,the larger dust particle represented what I would recognize as a single OM,with the dust that was within being smaller OM creating a collective that was the larger OM.These new OM are the ones that The Origin had not yet communicated with but knew of their existence. Even though The OM have certain energetic signatures-certain energetic density or weight-the sentient density or weight it detected did not equal the number of OM it had detected or communicated with. There are only five.They are in between the classifications of Non-captive OM and Pure OM.They are still forming,so to speak,because they are performing a "hoovering up" function.The smaller dust is gravitating together as partial OM energy,that being,partial in the sense of the sentient weight,to create a single OM of enough sentient weight to place it above the Non-captive OM category and below the Pure OM category.The dust could have gravitated together to create a single OM of "Pure"status,but it isn't doing that.They are some significant distance away from each other,although they are close in terms of The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness,hence all five together,but they are far enough away to work in separation. They are individually and collectively communicating with The Origin now.By this I mean the "dust within the dust"is communicating collectively and the larger OM-sized particle is communicating individually.The small OM-dust particles were only in a certain location (sector)within The Origin and they were spread out.There were small clouds of this dust,five of them,and each of the dust particles within the clouds naturally gravitated toward the same energy signature of dust,so to speak.These smaller dust particles are spread out over a distance of parsecs (a metric of distance or spherical volume)in the volume of the physical universe!Each of them was and is set in their intention to become fully coadunate as a single larger OM.It was only when they had enough "density"of this sentient weight that they discovered each other doing the same thing.At this point in their coalescence,it is almost too late to change the functionality of their plan to "become." They communicated with each other using the gaps in between Event Space and discovered that,although they could have changed their plans and become one large OM of the "Pure" category (they didn't know what the categories of OM were at this time),they actually liked what they were creating within themselves,they were happy to be smaller but have a peer group,to have company,and so they continued/are continuing with their collectively individual plans.

The Origin stated that to finish the coadunation process to create the five single Non- captive/Non-pure OM it may take millennia to finalize. The Origin decided not to recycle/reintegrate the energies that are The OM because they are a conundrum,and because they are a conundrum,they serve a function.Because they are uncreated,they interest The Origin,all of them do. I do have to state here,though,that there feels like there will be more on the New OM later in this dialogue.

HUM:There will be,but this is a very good start.Most of it is taken from The Origin Speaks but nevertheless this is a good start. ME:Well,there is no point in reinventing the wheel,is there? HUM:Not in the slightest.It may also be worthwhile reeducating your readers that,as an OM,the desire to incarnate is not a normal way in which The OM experience existence. Indeed,you have already reminded them that The OM,in general,prefer not to be in the "evolutionary cycle"per se!

## Some More on the Maverick OM That Is Me!-Anne,Soul Mates,and OM TES 

Well,it appears that I elect to be external to the creativity process while being in it. According to The Origin I move in and out of creativity but negate to assume responsibility for what I do.I break the rules,if indeed there were rules,and this is why I am where I am now. I apparently decided to enter into the creativity process through being incarnate within the environment of The Source Entity (One-SE1)for the evolution of both The Source Entity and The Origin.I apparently tinker,so to speak.I see how I can change the direction of that which is around me and move on when it is completed,whatever the outcome.And then,I move on to something else. ME:To be honest,Hum,my tinkering around with things seems to be a common theme in my current existence.Having said that,The Origin tells me that I am starting to see the beauty in ownership,not that I am going to,or indeed want to change my ways.But I am experimenting,tinkering,in the ownership experience,being part of something! HUM:The Origin may further advise you that being part of"something"is a fundamental expression of the need for communion with one's creator.All entities have this in-built desire,even The OM,irrespective of whether or not we find ourselves as far away from another OM as we can possibly get. ME:Yes,that may be true,but I can take it or leave it.I do not seek communion,nor do I desire or need communion.That's why I do what I do. HUM:That is only true while you are incarnate.In essence,when you are in the energetic you come and go,you enter into communion and move out of communion as and when you see fit. ME:Now here is a question for you. HUM:Carry on. ME:How does my way of working fit in with the way that Anne works and relates to being incarnate or even in the evolutionary cycle?Anne is an OM and as far as I am aware is my soul mate in the correct description. For the readers:to meet a true soul mate is a very,very,very rare occurrence.This is because the chances of another individualization (Aspect or soul)of one's True Energetic Self(TES)in the same location within a universe,the same universe,in the same frequency (if in the physical universe)and on the same planet or location of local density (planet)is almost impossible.So, Anne being my soul mate in the same frequency,space,and Event Space and from the same OM TES is remarkable if not suspicious at best. HUM:We can talk about you and your TES right now for a moment if you wish. ME:OK,why not.

HUM:For the last number of books and indeed throughout the channeling that created the book called The Anne Dialogues you have been under the impression that you and Anne are soul mates,two individualized aspects of the same OM TES. ME:Yeeesss?And your point is? HUM:This has been a useful thought process for you to use up until this point. ME:Are you about to tell me that we are not soul mates and not individualized aspects from the same OM TES? HUM:Yes and no. ME:Humph!What is that supposed to mean? HUM:Simply put,OM do not individualize their sentience and associated energy away from their OM TES in the same way that those TES created by a Source Entity do.This Source Entity-SE1! ME:I am picking up that in reality we are twin flames [a twin flame is the same sentience and associated energy that occupies two or more incarnate human,or other,vehicles-GSN]. That's why we are our TES! HUM:And there you have it.OM do not project a smaller aspect of themselves into another environment and therefore create what incarnate humankind call a soul,but they do divide up their sentience and the associated energy should they so desire. ME:So,any individualization of an OM is in essence a twin, triplet,or quadruplet,etc.,flame? HUM:Correct.You and Anne are equal divisions of the total OM TES that you are. ME:So why don't I feel like I have 50 percent of a lot of OM sentience with me in this incarnate state? HUM:Because,if you had that capacity you would be classified as a god in your own right.It would disturb the balance of experiential evolution available to those that are a true individualized aspect of their TES,on this planet. ME:OK,so where is this OM sentience,that OM sentience that is associated with me in this incarnation? HUM:Currently it resides with that part of you that you refer to as being Anne. ME:That doesn't answer where the sentience that was supposed to be equally divided between us when we both incarnate together is located.From what I remember,neither of us have a lion's share of sentience. HUM:That is because the sentience that was you both as twin flames at the point in your combined incarnate existence was relocated in another part of the multiverse. ME:You are suggesting that we parked a large chunk of our sentience somewhere while we went and played at being incarnate human beings? HUM:That's basically it.Remember that sentience is not formally attached to energy,it merely uses energy to experience,learn,and evolve.In the case of The OM,the sentience that is OM is normally isolated from the energies of the structure of The Origin;it exists without the need to be associated with it in any way.In the case of the individualized sentience that is created by a Source Entity it is associated with,it needs to commandeer a body of energy as a reference for experiencing,learning,and evolving ME:So,OM sentience does not need a body of energy?

HUM:No.No sentience does in reality,but,that which is created by the individualization of sentience and energy from a higher or larger entity needs to,simply because of it being in the evolutionary cycle. ME:I am aware that sentience is an isolated function in terms of its relationship with energy. I am also aware that sentience within energy,what I call or was driven to call a "body of energy,"is how sentience experiences the environments that are available as universes within the multiverse.We called sentience without a body of energy the True Sentient Self(TSS). HUM:And,that sentience within the body of energy allows the sentience to experience the environment in the way that it is supposed to experience it,by being "part"of the environment. ME:Yes,that's right.That's how sentience evolves,through being in the environment and being part of it.However,there is a slight dichotomy here.I thought that the whole point of being incarnate here on Earth was to move beyond the need to incarnate,to move beyond the need to be in the environment. HUM:It is.But it is a limited environment.This is an environment constructed of the lowest frequencies of The Source. ME:OK,so!Incarnation,being addictive and Karma being the resultant addiction to those low-frequency thoughts,behaviors,and actions,which,one only has while incarnate,but that also includes the desire to continue to experience low-frequency existence through incarnation,is only negated by experientially understanding this. HUM:Correct.

ME:The objective still stands then.It is to be in the physical but not of the physical,which means that one must master incarnation and all the addictions that it offers-to master Karma. HUM:It is,and it still is. ME:And this means to move beyond the need to incarnate into a low-frequency environment that requires a TES to project a smaller aspect of its sentience and energy in order to accelerate its evolutionary progression. HUM:It still does. ME:But this means that the TES sentience needs to be associated with a "body of energy"to achieve this. HUM:It does.As I have already stated,The TES of a Source Entity,Source Entity One in our example,is totally dependent upon its association with the body of energy that it uses to experience the universal environments that are within its overall multiversal environment. ME:But,The Origin explained to me that in the case of an energy,going through the twenty steps necessary for it to go from zero intelligence to a fully sentient being [see The Origin Speaks-GSN]results in its recognition that it is not reliant upon the energy/ies that created its sentience and that it,as sentient,can move from one body or group of energies to another at will. HUM:And this is correct.ME:I don't understand.

HUM:It's all to do with how sentience is individualized.In the case of Source Entity One all the TES are divisions of The Source,they are the product of the desire to individualize that which is to be created,as it was created-as individualized units of sentience and energy. When an energy progresses (evolves)on its own to the point of sentience and the subsequent recognition of that sentience is a separate function to that which gave birth to it,it has an experiential understanding that it is sentience!However,it still recognizes that to continue to evolve it needs to be associated with energy in some way.This is correct for any sentience that is created through what you call Darwinian evolution or individualization from a higher entity,that wishes to continue to experience the accrual of evolutionary content through association with an environment that is created by the use of energy. ME:What you are saying then is that sentience,when individualized as sentience that is associated with energy,needs to maintain its association with energy even though it knows that it is not that energy which it is associated with. HUM:Correct. ME:And,that sentience that is created as a function ofevolving energy needs to maintain its association with energy even though it knows that it is not that energy which gave birth to it. HUM:Correct. ME:OM,on the other hand,do not need to associate with energy because they were not created. HUM:Correct.

ME:And OM,because they are not in the evolutionary cycle,do not need to be associated with an energy because being in the evolutionary cycle involves the use of energy. HUM:Now you have it. ME:I went in a bit of a circle,didn't I? HUM:Yes,and you haven't finished it yet. ME:So,I see. OM,not being in the evolutionary cycle then,have no TES in reality,they are just sentience. HUM:Yes,but you,as OM have,are using a body of energy to experience the multiverse of this Source Entity. ME:True.So,this creates a TES,an OM TES. HUM:No!This is where you are getting confused.The TES of this Source Entity are individualizations of its sentience and energy.It needed to do this to create the possibility of being able to investigate itself and subsequently evolve.Sentience and energy need to be investigated by sentience and energy.This is specifically true if it is sentience and energy being investigated by itself. The OM are sentience,recycled Origin sentience,and as Origin sentience is not predominantly associated with the sentience and energy of a Source Entity. Indeed,it's not associated with the energy that gave birth to The Origin because it was not created by that energy. OM sentience is associated only with OM sentience because it rejected being associated with the individualized sentience and energy that became Source Entities. ME:Are you telling me that OM sentience did not get associated with energy at all?

HUM:Correct,it rejected the association at the point of The Origin's desire to create The Source Entities,not in the downstream function of intention,thought,and action(desire being before intention). ME:Based upon this then,my OM sentience individualized a part of itself and then commandeered a body of energy for that sentience to be temporarily associated with, which was further divided into two separate but connected parts creating the Aspects that incarnated in the incarnate human vehicles as Anne and myself. HUM:Yes. ME:And therefore,the rest of our sentience is within,but not attached or associated with,the energies,frequencies,subdimensional components and full dimensions of the multiverse of Source Entity One? Our sentience is in the energetic but not of the energetic-so to speak! HUM:Yes,it currently and temporarily resides in the structure in between the structure, using that which The Curators use to move in and around the multiverse and manipulate its function. ME:This is why I can't detect it! HUM:Correct,this is why you can't detect it. It is True OM Sentience,you are an integral but temporarily isolated volume of your True Sentient Self(TSS),which is not attached to or associated with any energy or structural part of The Source,or even The Origin-even though we are Origin based. I do have to say here,dear reader,that I very much feel that I have spent over a thousand words going in a circle that I knew the start of and the subsequent end of,at least I think I do.

The only real difference is the level of detail that is being presented to me.I very much felt that Anne and I were from the same TES,and we are;it's just that Ifelt that we were individualized Aspects from that TES,not the same "twinned"projected Aspect of that TES Maybe I should be using the better description of True Sentient Self(TSS)when it comes to The OM and not OM TES!I have talked about and had dialogue in the past about the fact that all entities created by a Source Entity or The Origin should be considered as TSS simply because sentience is not bound by that which it was individualized with or from,or from that energy which gave birth to it.However,the main thing to note is that sentience,individualized from a higher entity,is individualized together with energy simply because energy is the interface between the individualized sentience and the environment that that sentience is supposed to experience or work within.As a result,within the environment created by a Source Entity, sentience needs to be inextricably associated with energy to perform its role simply because the environment,multiversal or other,is created by the use of energy and/or its structure. What is new,though,is that The OM are not bound by the structural rules or laws of The Origin,even though they are essentially borne from the learning and experimentation of The Origin.The feeling that they can be called "random sentience"springs to mind,which is something that I want to dig deeper into later. HUM:Let's dwell on this some more. ME:OK,I am all ears. HUM:Source Entities are a product of the individualization of Origin sentience and energy that was individualized with the overall desire for the investigation and experience of that volume of structure that The Origin was aware of but that wasn't able to experience in detail due to its sheer volume of sentience.Irrespective of the volume of the structure that sentience is within,the volume of that sentience inhibits its own ability to experience the detail of that structure.Hence a Source Entity's sentience,and its associated energy,is infinitesimally smaller than the volume of sentience of The Origin and the structure that The Origin is currently investigating. ME:And therefore,the reason why a Source Entity,indeed our Source Entity,decides to individualize parts of its sentience,to investigate its own structure and the energies associated with it is the same.It's down to the volume of sentience. HUM:Correct. ME:Is this why an Aspect can also create smaller individualized versions of itself? HUM:No,this is simply a method of parallel experience;it is not a function of the volume of sentience attributed to an Aspect.Indeed,at the Aspect level the volume of sentience is not an inhibitor when considering its ability to experience the detail of the structure of a Source Entity and its associated energies. ME:Why? HUM:Simply because it is already small enough,so to speak. ME:Backtracking a bit then,a Source Entity's sentience is associated with energy because that's the best way for it to experience the structure of The Origin that the energy is within? HUM:Correct.And that is why once a Source Entity has experienced everything that it can do with the energy that its sentience is associated with,it withdraws that sentience and associates itself with another aspect of structure and energy within the volume of The Origin's structure that it is aware of but has no detailed knowledge of. ME:That's what I have been calling its volume of Polyomniscient sentient self-awareness. HUM:Correct,and when The Origin and The Source Entities have mapped this volume out it becomes The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient,polyomnipresent sentient self- awareness.Until,that is,it ascends its sentience into the second group of twelve levels of structure,that which is above the current and first group of twelve levels. ME:Just one question. HUM:Go ahead. ME:Do I need to use the word "sentient"in that description?For example,use "The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent self-awareness"in lieu of "The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness?"I mean, it's stating sentience twice! HUM:You can drop the second use of sentience if you wish. ME:Thank you.I just feel that the readers might get confused by its presence. HUM:However,the use of it is correct. ME:What!How do you mean? HUM:"Polyomni"describes that which is"everywhere"in many places."Polyomnipresent" therefore refers to that which is "present everywhere"in many places. Polyomniscient therefore refers to sentience being everywhere in many places but not focused.As a result,Polyomniscient Polyomnipresent refers to sentience being everywhere,in many places and being focused on being everywhere in many places concurrently [at the same time-GSN].The additional use of the word sentience simply draws attention to that which is of focus-"sentience." ME:Sounds like you are being pedantic to me. HUM:If you wish,but it is necessary. Look,if I remind you that incarnate humankind cannot really understand the words to describe such an experience let alone experience it,you would understand why such descriptors need to be,let's say,overly accurate or overly descriptive.Even though from my perspective,and yours when you are not incarnate,it's pitifully undescriptive. ME:OK,I've got it now. Talk about going in circles!!! HUM:They are iterative circles and therefore necessary.If you were with me in the energetic you would fully understand,but in this impaired state it's almost impossible to describe to you. ME:I really get the feeling of being reprimanded here. Or was Hum getting impatient with me?

HUM:You think you have grown since our first encounter [nearly twenty years ago-GSN], but your growth of knowledge has assisted in closing down your ability to be expansive. One of my main reasons for being with you again is to kick-start your expansion again. Now I am really crestfallen! ME:You mean I have grown an ego? HUM:It's more like you have become a little complacent. ME:OK.Although I can understand both possibilities.I vow to become more vigilant about how I think,behave,and act. HUM:Don't get me wrong,you are doing a fundamentally brilliant job,it's just that you are capable of SO MUCH MORE. ME:Oh boy!I can feel the workload coming. HUM:We will talk more in a moment.You have a special guest wanting to communicate with you. And with that last word I felt the sentience and associated energy that I recognized as Anne.

## One of One of One of One of One! 

ANNE:I just wanted to explain to you the function of how we exist. ME:Well,I think I am getting the picture now that what I previously knew was in error. ANNE:Sometimes we allow each other,by each other I mean those who are incarnate,to move in a direction that is incorrect because it may well be in the general direction or will lead one back into the correct direction.Even though it may result in going two sides of a triangle or even three sides of a square. ME:Sounds very inefficient to me. ANNE:Be that as it may be,it is a function that works with an acceptable level of success at this low level in the frequencies. ME:I understand.I am somewhat concerned that the description of our association with each other was incorrect though. ANNE:You mean that you were told that you are a soul mate to me?A separate aspect of sentience and energy from our OM TES? ME:Yes,and now I find out that we are classified as twin flames. Why was I misled? ANNE:To be honest with you,from a higher perspective,and that of sentience,there is no difference for an OM.At the time of the description,which was when we were working together on The Anne Dialogues,it was appropriate to concentrate on the use of the structure of an incarnate Aspect from the perspective of those created by Source Entity One.This is important because it is relative to almost everyone on the Earth ME:OK,I get it.I suppose that,looking at it from the bigger picture perspective,it is best to describe even things that are associated with The OM in terms that the general spiritual public can understand. ANNE:And this is specifically true when you consider that Pure OM don't usually incarnate, so it has to be in a common language.Now,however,this is not the case because we are dealing with and focusing on subjects that are OM related. ME:So,we are twin flames from a single OM TSS that has temporarily associated itself with a body of energy,not soul mates from a single TES that is the amalgamation of sentience and energy. ANNE:Correct,but as twin flames of sentience we are one sentience-still soul mates [sentient mates?-GSN]if you want to think of it in that way because we are one.The combination of sentience and energy divided to create twin flames is a different thing. ME:How do you mean? ANNE:When a TES from SE1 creates an Aspect,a division or individualization of its sentience and energy,to create that Aspect,it has to divide both the sentience and the associated energy concurrently.There is no division of sentience first and then association with energy or vice versa.This is because the sentience and energy are assigned to the TES by The Source as a package of its own divinity. ME:Divinity,is this where religion gets the term for God and its emissaries being divine,that they are divided(divined)from a higher entity?[Look up "go out on a limb"in a thesaurus. GSN]

ANNE:Yes,but it is misunderstood.Sentience that is divined from a Source Entity has to be associated with the energy that was divined to that Source Entity by The Origin,even though the divined sentience is that which "IS"the TES or its subdivined Aspect,etc. ME:But the sentience can still separate itself from the energy it is associated with,can it not? ANNE:Yes,but that function really only comes into practice at the end of an evolutionary cycle or if the sentience was created as a function of Darwinian evolution by energy itself to create a being. ME:So,a being has a greater function than an entity when it comes to the ability to separate out its sentience from the energy it is associated with or created by. ANNE:Only insomuch as part of its evolutionary progression is the recognition that it "is" sentience and not the energy that the sentience was created by,and that this gives it the ability to move from one "body"of energy to another. In the instance of a being,the sentience can move out of the energy that created it (it was evolved from),but it will need to associate itself with another body of energy or return back to its creating energy. This is the same for sentience that is divined from a Source Entity,TES,or Aspect. OM sentience is different. Remember as well that an entity has other functions above those of a being. ME:OK,OM sentience divines itself first and then associates itself with a body of energy should it desire to do so because it is always pure sentience,Pure OM sentience.It is sentience divining itself,not the combination of sentience and energy divining itself.It doesn't need to be associated with a body of energy. 

ANNE:And there you have it. ME:Great. ANNE:Looking at the bigger picture then we are one and the same. ME:Yes,I know.We are from the same OM sentience. ANNE:Yes,we are One of One of One of One of One. ME:One of One of what? ANNE:OM are never truly divined,divided,or individualized.For an OM there are five levels of oneness.I will explain in a linear way for you.Note here that OM never go below the Aspect level of divinity. we are One When we are individualized to one,two,three,or more divisions of one sentience at the Aspect level-the so-called twin,triple,or quadruple (etc.)flame level we are One At the Aspect level we are One -With our True Sentient Self,that which divined its sentience to create the Aspect/s we are One -With those other OM that are Pure (Captive or Non-captive),wherever they are within The Origin we are One With The Origin's sentience.In reality,this is true but in actuality we remain randomly divined we are not One with a Source Entity -Source Entities are not part of the sentient lineage of Pure OM, irrespective of if they are Captive OM -OM are beloved of The OM! we are two of five that is temporarily seven ME:Hold on a bit.I thought that every entity is one with The Source. ANNE:You need to read the words that you have just typed into your computer again.Those entities that are created by SEl or any of The Source Entities are one with their creating Source Entity.Those that are not,such as OM,are not one with The Source,or any other Source for that matter simply because they were not created by a Source Entity. ME:So,what about Captive and Hybrid OM? ANNE:Hybrid OM are just that,hybrid as a result of the way their energies and sentience mixed when The Source Entities were created.Source Entities that had OM sentience and the energy associated with them in a hybrid condition found that the percentage of OM sentience and associated energy was not significant enough for them to separate it out. ME:I suppose that's why "our"Source Entity (SE1)randomly created what we call Hybrid OM. ANNE:Correct. ME:What happened with Captive OM then? ANNE:They simply didn't have enough sentient weight or volume,so to speak,to allow them to break away from the structural boundary that is SE1. ME:Have captive OM always been OM?Or did they only come into existence when The Source divided itself into two,half remaining itself and the other half the multiverse and the billions upon billions of TES? ANNE:Captive OM were created at the point of a Source Entity's creation by The Origin,not as a function of its creativity or division of self.Hybrid OM are only a function of a Source Entity's creativity or division of self. The only thing OM can be one with is The Origin.However,this is only insomuch as being originally part of its sentience. ME:But if we all think in terms of the "creative structure,"everything is one with The Origin and therefore The OM can be one with a Source Entity because it is one with The Origin. ANNE:This is true.However,The OM consider themselves as being one with themselves, they are beloved of The OM.Although OM can be and are one with The Origin they can really only be classified as "random divined sentience." ME:Can The Origin recall The OM sentience and associated energy and absorb it back into its own Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness? ANNE:It did try.Straight after it created The Source Entities it noticed that part of the sentience and associated energy it used to create the twelve Origins had stayed as pure,but individualized Origin sentience,and refused to be anything else than what it was. ME:Why couldn't The Origin collect that sentience?I mean,surely it could command that which was it back into communion with itself?

ANNE:At the point in which The Origin created The Source Entities the sentience had already achieved an individualized state of awareness and had become OM. ME:It was that fast? ANNE:From the human perspective it was instantaneous;you see The OM discovered two things very quickly in their first moments of uncreativity.One that they were not bound by the rules or structural laws of that which they were within because in essence they were pure sentience and their associated energy could be swapped out for those energies that were part of the structure between the structure. ME:And two? ANNE:They discovered Event Space. ME:Are you telling me that The OM hid in Event Space and as a result The Origin couldn't find them or recall them? ANNE:That's about the size of it. ME:I am starting to think that The Origin was not so smart then. ANNE:Oh,it was.It just got caught out. It was at this point that I saw two images that were metaphoric rather than historically illustrative.Both of these images were given to me by Anne to help me understand how The Origin failed to recall the sentience and associated energies that ended up being The OM. In the first image I saw The OM as a group of mice in a box;in fact,the mice were in many boxes.The boxes were quite large and were designed to house another entity,a Source Entity that almost filled the box that it was within.The Source Entity in each box was represented by a large homing pigeon.Each homing pigeon was placed in a box without any of the boxes being checked to see if they were empty.Indeed,the mice were created as part of the homing pigeon and upon being placed into their respective boxes the homing pigeon changed into a homing pigeon and mice.The Origin was represented by a human,who never checked the contents of the boxes once the homing pigeons were placed in each box.The boxes were placed close together along a country roadside and a single method of opening all of the boxes together was created.The Origin,the man,opened all of the boxes together and the homing pigeons flew away.This represented the creation and individualization of sentience and energy that was to become Source Entities.The Source Entities,represented by homing pigeons,knew where their home (Origin)was and flew back to the man.The mice,representing The OM,jumped out of the boxes and scattered before the man (The Origin)noticed what was happening because he(It)was concentrating upon the pigeons.The mice disappeared down into the undergrowth and local drains(Event Space and the structure between the structure that was/is The Origin).The man never found the mice. In the second image a single box was presented to me.The boxes contained marbles of different sizes,very small ones in and around very large ones.If one didn't look closely enough, one could easily miss the smaller marbles.The man carried the box along a sidewalk to a place where he could distribute them in a proper and orderly manner,but the bottom fell out of it. The smaller marbles dropped out leaving only the bigger ones.The bigger ones represented The Source Entities.The small marbles,representing The OM,rolled onto the floor and again down into a nearby roadside drain.The man was more concerned about the large marbles and quickly counted them before realizing that the small marbles were important to him as well,but by then it was too late.

We have all done this,dropped something and not noticed its importance,because we were concentrating on something else that we thought was more important.It was the same with The Origin. ME:I prefer the image of the mice scattering,running around the feet of the man, disappearing into the undergrowth and down the drains.The mice were quick,cunning and small and therefore difficult to trace. ANNE:Yes,the drain (the structure between the structure)is a place that the man could never go,at least not fast,not in the correct time available to be able to catch at least one mouse.The man was too big,The Origin's sentience too large to focus on being reactive. The grass is Event Space,and every blade of grass looks the same from a distance while being subtly different. ME:And,of course,in both instances the mice and the smaller marbles describe The OM quite well,running or rolling around in a random way. ANNE:Yes,The Origin was slow to realize that parts of the sentience that it wanted to use to make into Source Entities were already individualized to the point of being able to have the capacity to make their own collective decisions. ME:The OM had already decided that they were individualized,what they were,where they were,and what their environment was? ANNE:Yes,of course,are we not random Origin Sentience?As such The OM knew/ know everything that The Origin knew/knows and so that which was Origin became individualized as OM the instant The Origin had the desire to reuse that which was it in a previous individualization.That sentience which became OM was simply following orders,to become individualized.

## Random Sentience 

I was pondering on a moment of previous discussion,one where The OM are not bound by the structural rules or the laws of The Origin,that,as Anne had just stated,were random sentience. With this thought I had the real feeling that this direction of discussion was not yet finalized and as a result,more depth was to become available.The first question to come into my head was how could The OM sentience be random? In the second question I wanted to know how could The OM be "apart"from,or not affected by,the very structure that they are part of and operate within,that which is The Origin? Anne had given me a good head start in understanding the answers to these questions and I expected her/it to continue the dialogue on this matter.I was therefore somewhat surprised (perhaps I shouldn't be though)to find Hum dive straight in to answer the question. HUM:It's simply my turn again. ME:You are all taking it in turns? HUM:In a roundabout way,yes. ME:What is special about The OM then that allows them to be above and beyond the structure of The Origin? HUM:Simply put we are The Origin. ME:Is that it?Is that the answer to the question? HUM:In a nutshell,yes.However,as you are starting to realize,this is not all of the answer.

ME:Go on. HUM:As Anne stated,we,The OM,are random Origin sentience,sentience that is not connected to the main sentience that is The Origin or its creations or its creation's creations,etc.,but while still having Origin status. ME:How then,if The OM have Origin status,do they resist being part of the overall sentience that is The Origin? HUM:The best way to think of The OM is as random sentience.We are like a free radical in the otherwise natural order of things,and as a free radical,we are not governed by the rules that everything else is governed by.Even The Origin's sentience is governed by that which gave birth to it simply because it decided to connect itself with the energies and structures surrounding those energies that it found itself,as a sentient being, within.The OM made no such decision and therefore are not governed by it.Of course, the sentience that is The Origin can manipulate that which it exists within and as a result is responsible for that which it creates.It enjoys individualizing part of itself and its sentience to create a workforce to help it know more about how and what it is by critiquing itself.It's just that The OM don't need,or want,to be part of that. ME:Can you give me another way to categorize the difference in the sentience that is The Origin versus that which is The OM? HUM:Another way to describe random sentience is to think of it as a stray or random thought.A stray or random thought is here one moment and gone the next and this is a perfect description of the way in which The OM work.

ME:Mmmm,yes!I find that when I have a stray or random,"unfocused"thought that when I ignore it,it disappears and is hard or impossible to get back.It's only when I am either not looking for that thought,or that I think extremely hard by backtracking my thought processes that I start to reestablish what that thought was about. HUM:In this experience as an incarnate human looking for that random,and now lost thought,you are experiencing what it is like for The Origin.The major exception is that as a random thought,the sentience that is that randomness is more than illusive,it's impossible to trace because the thought is not just lost,it has its own sentience that is driving it. ME:As a result then,The Origin has no way to backtrack as I would when looking for that stray or random thought! HUM:No,and that's because The Origin has no control over it. ME:Let me ask one question.Why is it that The Origin has no control over its own sentience, even though it is smaller and individualized? HUM:When The Origin created the twelve Origins to satisfy its desire to evolve faster,it gave them total autonomy.It wanted an equal or a group of equals that it would learn from and that they would learn from and evolve.The sentience that is OM has that same autonomy and as a result of being significantly and infinitesimally smaller in sentient volume has flexibility and maneuverability in and around The Origin's Polyomniscient, Polyomnipresent volume of sentient self-awareness in a way that no other entity has. This infinitesimally small autonomous Origin sentience therefore has the ability to move in and around the structure that is The Origin in a way that The Origin itself or other Origin creations cannot do. ME:Doesn't this annoy or frustrate The Origin? HUM:Not in the slightest.Once the desire for the creation of The Source Entities was made, The OM were also created as a byproduct,and,as a result of their heritage,two things happened.One,The OM inherited all The Origin's knowledge to date.And two,The Origin accrued a copy of all the activity and/or evolution that was or may be accrued by The OM. They also have connectivity to further knowledge as it happens,real time,so to speak. The Origin sees The OM as an interesting anomaly that resulted in the creation of stray and random sentience-uncreated autonomous sentience-and so is happy for The OM, to be what they are,an infinitesimally small and autonomous version of itself that it had no active part in creating.From a direct perspective,that is.It is,however,a loose symbiotic evolutionary relationship. ME:From my perspective The OM can be anything else but random sentience! HUM:I understand your thought process,but that was a description as far as The Origin is concerned. ME:What was the criteria that made The Origin think of The OM as random sentience? Hum:I thought I had just described it! ME:I know that The Origin defines The OM as random sentience because it is out of its control,so to speak,but there must be more to the function of The OM that makes them be able to be "random"in the vast sentience that is The Origin. HUM:The issue here is that,in everything that The Origin has done in its existence where it is in recognition of "self,"it has never experienced being in a position of not being in control of that which it created,even if it is classified as being uncreated,or created by accident,mistake,or byproduct. ME:The Origin is happy with being unable to control The OM,though.At least that's what you said. HUM:It is,and it delights in our existence.However,even though we inherited the ability to know everything that The Origin experiences either by itself or by it accruing experience, learning,and evolution through its creations and its creations'creations,these have direction from The Origin,even though it may be loose direction. HUM:We can,and do,do what we want in the way we want to do it.Try to think of us as a free radical,a sort of benign unassigned T-cell that floats around the human body,being able to link into any organ or bodily function and perform that function,or not as the case may be,without detection as a foreign object within that organ or bodily function. ME:Aren't you describing a cancer cell? HUM:The whole existence of a cancer cell,or even a virus,is to find a host and replicate in some way.Reproducing itself without consideration that the very host that it is assigning itself to,replicating the component parts of,replacing but not functioning like and therefore killing,the host and therefore itself. The OM don't replicate,they don't replace,and they don't need a host,because they are the host.The OM are microscopically smaller aspects of pure Origin sentience-without Origin directive.That's why The Origin called them random sentience. ME:But they can project smaller aspects of their own sentience and energy into other parts of the multiverse in SE1's case or other aspects of the structure of The Origin? HUM:Yes,but it's rare.You are rare.Anne was/is rare. ME:So,how many OM go through the process of incarnation? HUM:At one point there were seven Pure OM incarnate on Earth;they created what is remembered as being called "heaven on Earth."We will talk about this later.I can see that you want to talk about the structure of The Origin and how we move around it. ME:Thank you,yes,it had crossed my mind. HUM:Remember your mind is our mind,is OM mind,is OM sentience. ME:Thank you.I will try to think in this way.

## The Gaps in The Origin's Structure 

This was going to be interesting.I was very aware that The Curators,those entities that maintain the structure of Source Entity One's multiverse,were able to move in between the structure of the multiverse.This ability was,in effect,similar to,if not the same as,the ability to move in between the structure of The Origin.If one considers that the structure of The Source,of any Source Entity,is that of a small part of the structure of The Origin,used to create the energies that housed the sentience that The Origin individualized to create The Source Entities,then one can consider that in SEl's case The Curators were/are able to move around a very limited part of the structure of The Origin.They did this by using the gaps in between the structure.Based upon this,I was keen to understand how The OM moved around The Origin and if they used the same process as The Curators in SE1. OM:We would like to work with you as blessed of The OM. ME:Is this my OM group or collective?It doesn't feel like Hum. I didn't expect my OM group/collective to communicate with me at this time.I expected to continue my communication with Hum! OM:We/I/Hum wish to help you in your understanding of how we traverse the structure of The Origin.

ME:First of all,I have a question.OM:Yes,please ask. ME:Is Hum part of my TES or TSS? OM:Hum is from a different TES but is from the same TES collective. ME:OK,thank you.At least I know.I will communicate with you on this subject later. OM:This would be most useful for we are going to take up some time and some considerable amount of what you like to call "cerebral horsepower." ME:That's OK,I am happy to have it exercised! OM:There are things you need to understand,that you already understand,but can't understand in your current state. ME:And that is? OM:We who are beloved of The OM are impervious to the structure of The Origin because the structure of The Origin is based upon that which created it,energy! As OM,we are Origin Sentience;this you know.As sentience,we are not governed by energy.This you know from your previous dialogues with The Origin.Although we use energy to experience or witness that which is happening within The Origin from an intimate perspective,provided we are interested that is,we are normally present ourselves as pure sentience.Pure sentience has no boundaries. Now,this was a very interesting statement.If pure sentience has no boundaries,then in my simple understanding The OM can move anywhere within The Structure of The Origin. NOTE that I said ANYWHERE!! Do you know where I am going with this,dear reader?

ME:Does this mean that,as random Origin sentience,The OM can move absolutely anywhere in The Origin,including the structure beyond The Origin's current volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness? OM:Yes and no! ME:What?What do you mean,yes and no? OM:First,as Origin sentience,we are governed to some extent by the expansivity of The Origin within itself,but not by its structure.Second,this is a function only available to“Pure OM." ME:Are you suggesting that it is only the "pure"genre of OM that has so-called total autonomy from The Origin?And while I am at it,you haven't answered the question I asked a few sentences ago!What genre of OM am I communicating with right now?I know Hum is from another TES but from the same OM collective but what is Hum's genre and therefore what is the genre of OM that I am communicating with right now? OM:Both.We/I/Hum are of the genre of purity,"Purity beloved of The OM."And,to answer your question,yes! Let's revisit the characterizations of our sentience in relation to our ability to move in and around Source Entities and The Origin in summary. The Pure and Non-captive OM are independent of The Origin,the Pure OM more so.The Non-captive are limited in some respects to staying within the location of the/a Source Entity their energies were ejected/rejected from.Because Pure OM were inevitably formed from "pure"Origin sentience and its associated energy,it allows them to be both part of The Origin while being independent of it,which includes the functions of being fully separate to being fully integrated and any level of this in between.They are truly versatile in this manner.Please note that,from the human perspective,it is difficult to impossible for an entity incarnating into the third frequency level to accurately tell the difference between a Pure OM and a Non-captive OM if observed or communicated with using any of the modalities available via the third eye (clairaudience,clairsentience,clairvoyance,or psychometry). Captive OM and Hybrid OM are not independent of The Origin because of their closer association with a Source Entity.However,Captive OM can operate in an independent fashion within the environment that is a/The Source Entity they are captive within. ME:Why is it difficult for a human,for example,to tell the difference between a Pure OM and a Non-captive OM? OM:Simply because the sentient quotient (density or weight)of both genres is so large it is "blinding"to the so-called aware and awake incarnate observer when incarnate within the third frequency level.It's like trying to see the difference in snowflakes when one is snow blind! ME:OK,that makes sense.If the light is so bright,we must protect our eyes.It must be the same for the functions of the third eye.Let's get back to the way The OM move around The Origin's structure. OM:We will break it down into the genres of OM,not just the Pure OM. ME:OK,that makes sense.OM:It goes like this...

The Hybrid OM adopt the structure given to them by their creator and are therefore the same as any of the entities created by a particular Source Entity.Their structure is derived rather than inherited;that being,their structure is created by their Source Entity and not by their OM heritage simply because they are mostly Source Entity sentience and energy.Because of this they are constrained to being able to move around the structure of the environment that their Source Entity created for them to experience,learn,and evolve within in the same way as other entities created by a Source Entity (TES)through individualization of its sentience and associated energy.This means that they can move within the structure of their environment but not in between the structure,and not outside of this structure into the wider structural environment of their Source Entity. The Captive oM are also limited to the structure of the environment that they find themselves within.However,whereas Hybrid OM cannot move out of the environment that their Source Entity created for them to experience,learn,and evolve, Captive OM can.This means that they can move in and around the structure of the environment that their Source Entity created for their entities to work and evolve within, as well as the wider structure of The Source Entity that they are captive within.Source Entities have a maximum structural condition equal to four levels of the structure of The Origin,that being Frequency,Subdimensional Component,Full Dimension,and Zone. Captive OM can move within these structural levels as long as it is within the boundaries of their Source Entity. The Non-captive OM,having more sentient quotient than the Captive OM,hence their being Non-captive,gives them the ability to be divorced from the association with a Source Entity while still being able to enter into,and out of,their energies.They assume the same structure as The Source Entity they were supposed to be a part of giving them the ability to move in and around energies and structures of the same levels that they are created from.Although,Non-captive OM can move around the environment that is The Origin's Polyomniscient volume of Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness,they can only do so within those levels of structure that their energies are associated with,the first four.This they can do independently of the desires of The Origin although they are limited in some respects to staying within the location of The Source Entity their energies were ejected/rejected from. Captive OM and Hybrid OM are not independent of The Origin because of their closer association with a Source Entity. The Pure OM are 100 percent Origin sentience and energy.They have all the structural characteristics of The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness.It is for this reason that they can,and do,have full independence within The Origin and are able to traverse all structural conditions within its volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness,without hindrance or resistance,including free movement within the structural gaps.They can move around The Origin by becoming part of it and transferring their very essence throughout the structure that they are in,or that is within The Origin.What's more,they can span the structure that is The Origin either in totality or throughout it,based upon, that is,their own density (frequency),of which there is a limitation only in their ability to maintain their own integrity.Or they can span The Origin's structure in a linear fashion,spreading themselves in one direction only,a straight line,so to speak,from“Frequency”through to“Margin." Pure OM have the ability to separate out the detail of their structure and create a multiple focus of their attention to each aspect they separate out into.In essence, they can position that part of themselves that is frequency based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness that is frequency based;that part of themselves that is subdimensionally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness that is subdimensionally based,that part of themselves that is dimensionally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness that is dimensionally based and that part of themselves that is zonally based,within that area of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness that is zonally based,etc.,etc.,right up to the Margins,the final structural component within The Origin's volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness. The OM are capable of many things,one of them,certainly with the Pure OM,being the capability of operating outside Event Space. Now let's talk about the Intermediate OM. The New Version of The OM-The Intermediate OM,those five OM that are currently under integration energetically,will have nine levels of structure when they finish their process of attraction and become five OM rather than OM "dust,so to speak-this being the structure of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness classified as "Frequency"through to "Totality"[see The Origin Speaks-GSN].From the perspective of their ability to move around the structure of The Origin,they will have full autonomy within those nine levels of The Origin's Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness including free movement within the structural gaps between these levels only.Intermediate OM will have the ability of manipulating Event Space within their structural constraints but cannot operate outside of it. We will talk more of these new OM later in this dialogue.ME:It looks like the abilities of The OM from Non-captive OM upward to Pure OM seem to be relative to their/your sentience. OM:It is.As we stated before,it has a lot to do with the function of Pure OM being The Origin and The Origin being Pure OM,but with The Origin not being able to control that part, those parts,of itself that are fully and totally autonomous. ME:Are you sure you are fully autonomous from The Origin?I mean,The Origin is The Absolute,"All there is,"THE MAJOR SENTIENCE! OM:Let's just say that The Origin,in its delight at the fact that anything that happens is something to be observed and cherished,turns what can only be called a blind eye to what we do and how we do it. ME:So,The Origin could reabsorb The OM but just chooses not to. OM:Yes and no.To The Origin we are but a very,very,very small number of stray or random thoughts that it may or may not notice,even in its Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent state of sentient self-awareness.One moment we can be sentiently visible,the next we are not.As a result,we are mostly invisible to The Origin.

ME:I don't quite understand. OM:Let me give you a human example.Have you ever had a thought,sometimes an important thought,that just comes and goes,and no matter how hard you try,you cannot get that thought back into the forefront of your mind? ME:Yes,more times than I care to remember. OM:Well,this is what it's like for The Origin when its sentience detects OM presence or function-only it is a lot more difficult to recover than the thought. ME:I would have thought that with The Origin's level of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness that it would be able to trace you all?In fact,it must do because it communicates with you. OM:Ultimately it could,but when one considers that whenever any sentience within The Origin experiences,The Origin also experiences.Ultimately these experiences are added to its evolutionary quotient and subsequent progression,so what is the point in tracking that sentience down and corralling it and reintegrating it,when it is ultimately of use to The Origin.Note that communication is not a function of traceability;we will discuss this later. ME:Now that makes perfect sense to me. OM:One of the main things that makes The Origin ignore us is our movement in and around the energetic structure that is The Origin. ME:So how do you move around the structure of The Origin?OM:Easily! ME:Yes,I can see that [I get the feeling that The OM are teasing me here.-GSN],but what makes The OM able to move in and around the structure of The Origin in the way you say is easy? Uncreativity,Connectivity,and Non-Connectivity OM:It's more to do with the sentient quotient associated with the level of uncreativity and connectivity-non-connectivity with The Origin. ME:Hold on!What does that mean? OM:The sentience of The Origin is infinitesimally expressed across all of the volume of energetic structure that is its Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness, and as a result its Polyomnipresence requires focus to drill down into the details of what it is.Hence the need for,and the creation of,smaller entities to help it experience,learn, and evolve. OM,as with other entities and beings,are small self-contained autonomous sentience and as a result,can have a detailed focus on the environment that our sentience is located within or without.OM sentience,that being non-captive,pure,and in-between OM,being specifically autonomous units of sentience and associated energy from The Origin,have the ability to move in and around the structure and sentience of any part of The Origin's structure in an un-hindered way,that we are associated with,because of this smaller volume and focus of Origin sentience.Obviously,Captive OM are limited to the environment created within,and structure of,The Source Entity they are associated with.Hybrid OM are constrained to the same abilities as those entities that are created by their Source Entity.

I just got an image of the structure of The Origin being like the weave in a length of cloth, with lots of layers of cloth laid one on top of each other.Microscopically the weave has holes in between the knots of the weave and that the gaps in between the layers of cloth are massive in comparison to these holes. The weave itself being the structure of The Origin [see the descriptions of the first twelve levels of structure of The Origin in The Origin Speaks-GSN]that everything exists within is actually only 40 percent of the volume of energy that is The Origin.The rest is,and can only be classified as,nonstructure or the structure in between the structure. ME:Looking at the image I assume you just gave me it looks like over 60 percent of The Origin is structureless,so to speak. OM:More actually,and one could consider The Origin as mostly structureless.The OM, within the environment they are"within,"become "without"by moving into these gaps or holes in the structure and the void in between the layers of the structure.We slip in between the holes in the structure into the structural gaps because we have no creativity and no connectivity to anchor us. ME:What do you mean,you have no creativity to anchor you? OM:The gaps in between the structure of The Origin,and everything that The Origin and its creations create,get filled in,so to speak,by that which is created. ME:You mean creativity fills in the gaps? OM:More like,that which is created creates a link with that part of the structure of The Origin that it was created in.This includes evolutionary content and its evolutionary quotient,momentary association with sentience such as the transition of sentience from one location to another and its associated connectivity with the sentience that the focus of sentience moves from and to,and the subsequent population of,or expansion of, sentience into that area where no sentience was previously! ME:OK,so previously,in a dialogue a long time ago,The Origin told me that many of The OM don't get involved with the creativity process,that it ties them down by creating responsibility for that which they have created.Is this still true?Is creativity another way of populating the gaps in the structure of The Origin? OM:As we just said,any function of sentient interaction with The Origin creates a link between the structure and the structureless.It is a sentient link and as such is not structure or the creativity of structure.It is,however,conducive to the growth in sentience of The Origin allowing The Origin to move its sentience around those areas of its structure and nonstructure that it couldn't do previously.Of course,The Origin can and does do this,but the passage of OM sentience adds to this expansion. Creativity creates an attachment,responsibility for,and continued attention to that which is created.The evasion of the creativity process is still a directive of most OM for a number of different reasons.I will identify them for you. Creativity occupies space.That which is created needs and is given by default a location for its existence.This in itself creates structure within and without the existing structure.If you like,it creates a level of resistance between aspects of structure.It creates a bridge between the gaps in the structure turning nonstructure into structure.If you want,you can think of it as clogging the holes in the weave of a sheet of cloth.

Creativity requires ownership of and responsibility for that which is created. Ownership of that which is created as well as the responsibility of the maintenance of the creation is a fundamental requirement of creativity.Even if the creation is uncreated later,its uncreation creates ownership of the uncreation. Uncreation leaves a shadow.Even if that which is created is uncreated,the location of the uncreated creation leaves its mark,signature,or shadow.This shadow is an indication that the location of the structure that was used has been exposed to the sentience of an entity,its creativity,what it created,and the desire surrounding that which was created as well as the sentient and energetic signature of the entity itself.It creates notional structure if you like.[This must be why or how psychometry works on the physical level.-GSN] Once an OM enters into the creativity process it becomes attached to being in the creativity process.This attachment limits its movement in and around The Origin by needing to be close to that which is created. Being noncreative results in total freedom to move in and around any aspect of The Origin's structure and nonstructure,within the constraints of its associated purity of sentience,that is. The OM like to have total freedom of movement and no responsibility to restrict that movement but even with no responsibility and no creativity to restrict our movement the use of sentience to move around creates links of sentient pathways in and around the structure of The Origin as well as through its gaps. ME:I am seeing an image of a vapor trail or snail trail being left behind.

OM:Well,that's a novel way to think about it and if it helps,use it.Thinking in that context you could also use the trail that is left behind on your Garmin navigation computer when you are cycling,the light blue line representing where you have been,and in our context where your sentience has left its mark,so to speak. ME:Doesn't this "OM trail"result in the gaps in between the structure of The Origin being filled up,just a little bit? OM:No,but it does provide an indication,what I just called "sentient pathways"within and without the structure of The Origin.It tells those beloved of The OM where we have been and where we were going to. ME:Is this a form of connectivity? OM:No,not really.It can be best described as a form of nonconnected connectivity. ME:What do you mean nonconnected connectivity? OM:One has to think of it in this way.Visualize the weave in the sheet of cloth as a way to understand the structure of The Origin again. ME:OK,I am with you. OM:The OM trail moves in and around the weave but does not touch the weave. ME:Got it! OM:In this illustration,The OM trail is not in contact with the structure of The Origin and as a result provides limited,if no,connectivity between The OM and The Origin.It is useful only for The OM. ME:Can The OM use this trail for communication?

OM:The OM are always connected in a Polyomniscient way so it provides no advantage from a connectivity point of view.It is simply a way of seeing where our sentience has gone from-to. ME:It's a form of traceability then? OM:Yes,in a minor way with the exception that it isn't a form of connectivity.Linking into the sentience trail of an OM is not a means of connecting to or with them.It is simply a means of knowing that we were,at some point,there-wherever there is within and without the structure of The Origin. Similarly,connectivity is not a function of traceability.Sentience,or should we say,the passage of sentience,is traceable whereas sentience that is connected through the desire of two or more individualizations of sentience to be "connected"does not produce the ability to be a method of traceability,to find the focus of those individualizations of sentience simply because sentience "in general"is Polyomnipresent within its volume of Polyomnipresence,and as such is everywhere. ME:This sounds like a conundrum to me,sentience is traceable but only as the passage of sentience,while when sentience is connected or in communion,it is not traceable because individualizations of sentience are not traceable in the vast sea of Polyomnipresent Polyomniscient sentience. OM:Correct.Think of it in terms of not seeing the trees for the wood.I will say it again, communication is not a function of traceability and traceability cannot be achieved through sentience in communication with sentience.Another way to think of it is the function of neurons in the human brain.Each neuron is both individualized and identical in its function.It's just that the individualization is a transient function of its function within a group of functions. ME:I am getting there slowly. OM:This might help.Yet another way to think about it is like a group of stem cells.They are all identical up to the point of individualization,one becomes a heart cell,another becomes a liver cell and another becomes an eye cell.Once they become their role and perform the function of that role they stay in that role and function.In this instance consider the stem cell as being able to change to any role and function as and when required.It remains as a stem cell but can be a pancreas cell one moment,a skin cell the next,and a bowel cell moments later;it can also change back to being a neutral un- programmed cell.The stem cell is Omnifunctional.In the case of sentience,it's the same but it's Polyomnifunctional. ME:In some respects,then,sentience is dormant until it is used by a greater level of focus of functional sentience,so to speak?The OM are therefore a focus of sentience! OM:Yes,that is correct.And that is another way OM can move around The Origin undetected.The functional aspect of OM sentience is focused while within the Polyomnipresent,Polyomniscience of The Origin,which is mostly unfocused until it has a role to play and that role can be transient,permanent,or non-permanent.Remember The OM and The Origin are one and the same,it's just the focus of the intention that is different,to not specifically create in the way that has created The OM,even if the intention was not there as a focus.As a result,when the "focus of sentience"that is "OM,"which is Polyomniscient,is moving around the Polyomnipresence of The Origin's Polyomniscience,it is also moving around its structure. Try to think of sentience in these terms.The essence of sentience is the individualization of localized sentience that may or may not have focus or function and may or may not be temporarily or permanently linked. As I have said before,when The OM move around The Origin,they move around without connecting to the structure of The Origin.They go through the holes in the weave in the cloth in the example I just gave you.Sentience,or should we say,the population or accrual of Origin sentience,fills in the gaps between the structure but does not connect to the structure.This is nonconnected connectivity between sentience and structure.Also,the focus of sentience that is an OM is temporary within the overall Polyomniscience of The Origin. ME:What does that mean? OM:Basically,we are a focus of sentience and as that focus moves around The Origin it uses both the void in between the energetic structure that is classified as "potentially functional sentience"which is also that sentience which is part of the Polyomnipresent, Polyomniscient aspect of The Origin.In moving through the Polyomnipresent, Polyomniscient aspect or "Polyomnifunctional"sentience of The Origin,we provide a transient focus which we can use to track each other.This focus,being transient,reverts back to Origin focus as soon as our focus leaves that volume of sentience thereby leaving a microscopic change that is almost impossible to notice,specifically in the greater overall focus of the sentience that is The Origin. When we move into a volume of "potentially functional sentience"we again make a minor change in the focus of that sentience.It starts as "potentially functional sentience,"then when it is populated by the focus of sentience that is OM,it becomes OM for a moment or as long as The OM focus is required to be there and then it becomes "potentially functional sentience"once The OM focus moves on.In this instance the difference in the sentience is more noticeable because the "potentially functional sentience"has had a function,albeit a transient one,where previously it had none.Here we see a more discerning trail that is easier to follow,that being,should one know what to look for. Note here that when the focus of sentience that is OM moves though the different volumes of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent Origin sentience,it does not use that sentience to do anything else other than be a medium for the movement of OM sentience. Any use of the sentience for creativity would change the status of the sentience to sentience associated with the accrual of evolutionary progression and entrap or ensnare The OM that used that sentience with the burden of responsibility. ME:And the burden of responsibility is something that The OM generally avoid! OM:Yes. ME:Makes sense.It illustrates in some way why The OM are elusive,to use a better word. OM:It might!

## Two of Five That Is Temporarily Seven! 

In a dialogue with Anne earlier in this book,Anne stated that we were two of five that were temporarily seven.I had seen us as both five and seven,but I didn't quite understand the significance.As both you and I,dear reader,are aware,it is normal for Hybrid OM to incarnate,Captive OM are also known to incarnate,but Non-captive OM or Pure OM are not known to incarnate,personal presence accepted as a deviation from that statement. As a result,I thought it relevant to ask Anne to help me out with this two of five/seven conundrum. ANNE:What do you want to know? ME:Boy!That was quick!Have you been with me all the time? ANNE:Yes,you have been needing more and more help recently,especially with the change in Event Space and subsequent reality.[It's May 2020,we have interesting political situations and leaders together with a world COVID 19 pandemic!-GSN]I am always by your side. ME:I didn't ask this question at the start of this dialogue,but I thought that you were reintegrating with our TES after the work we did on The Anne Dialogues? ANNE:I was but I left a significant percentage of this Aspect in individuality to allow me to help you in the rest of your incarnation.It's going to be a challenge,more than we thought it would be before the incarnation process started for us.As you have just pointed out,a lot of things have happened in the last four years that have created the need for what can best be described as a need to look at yourselves in the mirror.This need is apparent even to the most unaware incarnate. ME:Thank you,I am looking forward to the help.Now,onto my question.What does two of five that is temporarily seven mean?What does a significant percentage mean? ANNE:A significant percentage means enough to do the job. ME:OK,understood. ANNE:It's to do with the number of Pure OM that we are associated with that have smaller aspects of sentience projected from their TES.Some of these Aspects are incarnate and some are not.So,with this in mind,right now it could be considered that there are seven aspects of OM sentience that have individuality within a total of five OM TES that I,you, we are associated with. ME:Can you elaborate further? ANNE:Certainly.There are five OM TES that group together in belovedness,two of these five have decided to move into the energies of this Source Entity and project a smaller part of themselves into the multiversal environment that it has created.Our TES projected a single Aspect that was shared between two incarnate human vehicles and another TES projected a single Aspect that occupied a single incarnate human vehicle.This gives seven because our Aspect counts as one-even though it is twin flamed,so to speak [see The Anne Dialogues-GSN].Based upon this,we have two Aspects,and five TES,which is the seven individualizations of OM sentience,even if it is temporary. ME:Are there any more Pure OM incarnate on the Earth?

ANNE:No. ME Are there any Non-captive OM incarnate on the Earth? ANNE:There are twenty-seven projections from eighteen Non-captive OM TES. ME:How about Captive OM? ANNE:There are seventeen projections from twenty-nine Captive OM TES. ME:So,there are more Non-captive OM incarnate on Earth than Captive OM. ANNE:If you are counting the number of projections,that answer is yes.If you are counting the number of TES,the answer is no. ME:Ah,yes,I see what you mean.And how many Hybrid OM are there incarnate on the Earth? ANNE:Of the various levels of percentage of OM sentience there are seventy-two thousand, one hundred and ninety-two TES in total. ME:What's the maximum level of OM sentience that a Hybrid has? ANNE:Within Source Entity One,15 percent,and there are not many.There are more at 12 percent.In reality,though,most have less than 1 percent. ME:How many Captive OM are there in total within Source Entity One? ANNE:Seventy-two. ME:And how many Non-captive OM are associating themselves with Source Entity One? ANNE:Thirty-two. ME:That's not much more than those who are projecting smaller Aspects of themselves into some part of The Source's multiversal environment. ANNE:No,Non-captive OM are not so plentiful,for want of a better word.The Purer the sentience,the lower the number of OM at that level of purity of sentience. ME:And here is a big question,how many Pure OM have associated themselves with Source Entity One? ANNE:None. ME:None?How can that be?There are Pure OM incarnate in Source Entity One's multiversal environment.I am one Aspect of one of them. ANNE:There are none! ME:Please explain,because from my viewpoint there are at least two! ANNE:No Pure OM associate themselves to a Source Entity. We/Our TES is not associated with Source Entity One. ME:But we are here,within Source Entity One! ANNE:Yes,we are,but this does not necessitate an association,it is simply an experiential visitation.Think of it as "just passing through."We have done this with the other Source Entities,that's why you found it a relatively achievable process to contact the other Source Entities while incarnate within this Source Entity. ME:I found it a challenge,if you remember. ANNE:Yes,but once you achieved communication with Source Entity Two,it was a process that you could use again and again.OK,the "feeling"and the energetic alignment/ harmony was different,so to speak,but you took it in your stride. ME:What about the other three OM that we are beloved to,have they projected a smaller Aspect of themselves into Source Entity One's multiversal environment?

ANNE:No,they remain outside of the energies of The Source.Indeed,our TES is outside of The Source and the TES of the other OM projected into The Source's multiverse is also outside of The Source.It's only the projections that are inside the energies of The Source. ME:This is a bigger question. ANNE:Go ahead. ME:How many OM are there in total? ANNE:You mean how many were created in the uncreation process? ME:Yes.How many are wandering around the structure of The Origin? ANNE:Do you want to include those that are within or associated with a Source Entity? ME:Yes,the total including the Hybrid OM.I am not worried about the percentage mix of Hybrid OM versus Source Entity sentience though,that would be too difficult to report here. ANNE:I will guide you into drawing up a table if that helps. ME:That would be a great way to illustrate the number of OM to the readers. ANNE:It will be OM TES only though. ME:That will do fine. ANNE:OK.It goes like this. Anne describes the table and I draw it out in this document.

ME:I am surprised that no OM have associated themselves with Source Entities Five and Twelve. ANNE:Source Entity Five is just Source Entity Five.It is its own sentience and so,although if it created individualizations of itself it would create hybrids,there are no Non-captive OM in and around SE5 and no Captive OM associated with its creation. There are only two Source Entities that have no Non-captive and Captive OM, and that's Source Entities five and twelve.Source Entity twelve is in millions of individualizations outside the current twelve levels of The Origin's structural volume of Polyomniscient,Polyomnipresent sentient self-awareness.It is in the first of the next set of twelve structural levels of Origin.Nothing has changed since your dialogue with it in Beyond The Source Book 2.It never had any of The Original sentience associated with the creation of the twelve Origins and as a result has no Non-captive,Captive,or Hybrid OM. It is unique in this matter. ME:I note that the number of Non-captive and Captive OM is low in all Source Entities. ANNE:That is right.That is because they have a higher level of Origin sentience and as such Origin sentience in that volume is a rarity.You will also notice that the number of Hybrid OM is high in half of The Source Entities. ME:Yes,I noticed that. ANNE:This is because an entity or individualization from a Source Entity can have less than 1 percent of original Origin sentience associated with it.Not many get into a whole percentage figure.And only a few are in the 10 percent and above bracket and almost none is above 13 percent.Based upon this,Hybrid OM of a higher percentage of Origin sentience are also a rarity. ME:I need to ask a question that every one of my readers will be asking. ANNE:And that is? ANNE ME Together:Are those Hybrid OM Aspects that incarnate in the physical universe special in comparison to those who don't have Origin sentience? ME:Ha,ha,ha!We both said that together. ANNE:Yes,we did.I thought it was quite an obvious question,so obvious that I thought I would say it with you. ME:And the answer is then?

ANNE:No!When any entity incarnates into the physical universe they have to work with the frequencies of the universe and what it allows them to do at a particular frequency.The lower down the frequencies that an Aspect incarnates,the lower the communicative and functional ability is available.Every Aspect,without exception,must work with two things,the level of sentience assigned to them and the frequency of the environment they incarnate into.This is irrespective of the genre of sentience that is their TES. ME:So,a Pure OM incarnate is no better off than an incarnate with Source Entity derived (individualized)sentience when incarnate. ANNE:No,there is no difference in real terms. ME:But? ANNE:As with all incarnate Aspects it is the sentient quotient that makes the possibility of a difference in how that Aspect functions while incarnate.If you remember,the sentient quotient is that which is earned by a TES through evolutionary progression,a percentage of which can be assigned to an Aspect to assist in its individualized state. Notice that I didn't state incarnate individualized state.This is because the individualization of sentience and energy from a TES is not always a function of the need to experience some part of The Source's multiverse at the lowest frequencies.It can also mean that the Aspect plays its part in those frequencies above those that require some form of incarnation to support its experience. ME:What you are suggesting then is that it is possible for a "normal"incarnate Aspect to have more sentient quotient assigned to it than that of an Aspect of the TES of a Pure OM which is also incarnate at the same time,point,and location in Event Space?By normal I mean the incarnate Aspect of a TES whose sentience and energy is totally derived from the individualization of its sentience and energy without any OM content,which would make it a Hybrid. ANNE:Correct.Based upon that,it is entirely possible for a high number of the incarnates here on Earth to have more sentient quotient than you as the incarnate aspect of a Pure OM TES. ME:Now that's a sobering thought!ANNE:Isn't it just.It's a real ego leveler. ME:Well,it's certainly one that puts me in my place! Another question while we are on the subject of The OM group that we are associated with... ANNE:Go ahead. ME:In terms of the three Pure OM that were incarnate here on the Earth,you,me,and the other,what sentient quotient were we assigned? ANNE:I can only say that,from the perspective of sentient quota,we were all equally individualized.And before you ask,that means that as a twin flame we had enough sentience in our full Aspect to enable an effective separation or sharing of the Aspect between two incarnate human vehicles. ME:How about now with the majority of your half of the sentience in communion with our TES? ANNE:The percentage sentience that you have is still as it was when we were first incarnated in this Event Space.The percentage sentience I have is a percentage of that which I had when we were incarnate.That being,there is enough sentience that remains individualized to be able to communicate with you in a meaningful way.

ME:So that part of you/me that I am communicating with now is less that the 2.5 percent that we would consider to be the normal level of TES sentience that an incarnate Aspect would have? ANNE:Yes,1.75 percent of my total sentience is in communion with our TES.The residual 1.0 percent is with you now [think in terms of it being 1.75 percent as a percentage of 2.75 percent equaling circa 64 percent-GSN].This is the minimum level of sentience required to make a meaningful connection to the physical as well as to communicate with you. ME:Ah!Now I know the level of sentience that we had together:2.75 percent sentience each giving a total of 5.5 percent sentience shared between us. ANNE:It seems like a lot,but when you think about the fact that it is shared between two of us it is not. ME:Why is 2.75 percent sentience a lot when one considers that most incarnates have the 2.5 percent average sentience.Also,I note that 0.1 percent is a big difference. ANNE:When considering the difference as a single allotment of sentience versus another single allotment of sentience you are correct.The issue is that when sentience is shared, like it is in the twining,tripling,or quadrupling,etc.,the percentage sentience needed in totality to sustain the two,three,or four incarnate vehicles is more than that for the sum total of two,three,or four individualized Aspects of sentience. ME:Why is that?One would have thought that the total amount for the twinned Aspect of sentience would be lower because it is occupying two incarnate vehicles with one Aspect. ANNE:It's reasonable logic but not correct logic in this instance.If the sentience is used in more than one incarnate vehicle it needs to have a higher total level of sentience.This is to act as a barrier between the twinned (more than one),etc., Aspects of that sentience,so that there is no crossover.It is also needed to assist in the processing of the experience of that sentience as many (more than one) individualizations of sentience,even though it is one individualization of sentience. [Sentient crossover results in shared experiences and would be classified as schizophrenia for both,if two,incarnate vehicles are sharing the same sentience.It obviously increases if more than two incarnate vehicles share the same sentience.-GSN]ME:So in summary what you are saying is that the sentience used in the "twinning function"needs to have a higher level of sentience to ensure that the sentience,although one,can function as two in an individualized and non-interfering way. ANNE:In a nutshell,yes.You see,even with the additional sentience associated with a twin there is still experiential/communicative leakage between them. However,the level of experiential/communicative leakage is not significant enough to cause an issue.This leakage,especially the communicative leakage,is well documented and classified as a minor level of intuitive telepathy between physical twins. ME:How much sentience is needed to create this sentient barrier? ANNE:An efficient barrier achieving the level of individualization that we experienced is going to use 0.05 percent. ME:That gave us 0.2 percent sentience more that the average of 2.5 percent then? ANNE:It did and 0.2 percent is a big difference in incarnate terms,in fact it's a big difference in any terms.

ME:OK.The big question that people are going to ask is what level of sentience is required to allow the Aspect to be able to work in a higher level without the need for years and years of metaphysical/spiritual training and meditation? ANNE:To be incarnate as an aware and awake Aspect requires at least 3.0 percent sentience. This level allows the incarnate Aspect to know who and what they are but still have the need to work on themselves to overcome the psycho-spiritual limitations associated with the low frequencies of the physical accrued by them as a result of parent,peer group,and educational programming.To be fully aware and awake requires 3.5 percent sentience. This means that the incarnate Aspect is fully aware of who and what they are and that they are not adversely affected by parent,peer group,and educational programming,or the low frequencies of the physical universe from a connectivity perspective. ME:What about other functions such as manipulation of energy,creativity,telepathy, teleportation,etc.? ANNE:These functions work but the incarnate Aspect is aware of the responsibility of being able to access such functions and as a result doesn't show them to the wider public. ME:From the perspective of The OM then what is the significance of the level of sentience that we were allotted? ANNE:Actually,our percentage sentience was kept to a minimum. ME:Why? ANNE:This was to enable us to do what we needed to do and not draw too much attention to ourselves.You already have more than enough attention and this is distracting you from working on the detail in the background.

ME:I thought I was doing an OK job? ANNE:You are,but any form of limelight results in the possibility of the ego taking a foothold.You are best being in the background,that is,from the everyday perspective. Your work on the book method of education is as good as it could be,as are the workshops you are holding.These are enough and attended by the right people,that being,those that are expansive enough to work with the information.We are delighted that you are creating a healing workshop.This is good and right now Uune 2020-GSN] is very important.We note that the geographical location is limited at the moment and we understand why,but the need in that location is the greatest at this juncture for there is a lot of adverse world attention and a lot of spiritual progress at the same time.[The healing workshops were introduced as a spin off from Psycho-Spiritual Healing in China because the education process and quality control of the methods illustrated in the book were more controllable and sustainable.-GSN] You will go backward and forward in your attention and direction but will eventually settle on one major direction once the work on writing the books is finished.This will lead to a level of introversion-working on yourself again and preparing for departure from this frequency in a meaningful,knowledgeable,and aware way. ME:I like to be in the background but a part of me likes to see how people are working with the information.I like to see them progress and I want to share the information with them.I like to expand their consciousness. ANNE:I/We know.Know this though:you will never be a bestseller or a household name,but that is the point of this work.You will always retain a certain level of difference from all other metaphysical and spiritual teachers,a level of uniqueness This knowledge is for those who can rise above the constraints of the human thinking process to one where there are no boundaries.To one where prior education and scientific discoveries are not a barrier or a distraction or a misdirection.To help those who want to learn without having limitations thrust upon them.This is beyond the tip,the sharpest point on the end of the needle.This is what you are working with.

At this point Anne's sentience and energy dissipated.I knew in the back of my mind that she/it/our OM TES would be back later in the subjects that are lined up to write about in this book.I also felt that continuing the current dialogue was not profitable for Anne knew that I would ask questions about the success of the work.I didn't need to ask because I know that in an environment where everything is happening concurrently,that "it"was already the success that it needed to be.

## A Question of Duality and Entanglement 

I decided to have a change of direction and go into one where I was gaining a bit of pressure from my Chinese agent,Leo,to address.He has an active interest in theoretical physics and wanted to publish some text from my work that related to it.Indeed,it was already known that there was a lot of consequential material on this subject within my books but there was a request to provide a focused effort on creating a link with the information that I had channeled and the general ideas of theoretical physics.This was the time to do it.I thought I had felt the pull to the subject for some weeks now,and this pull was getting stronger and stronger to the point where I could ignore it no longer.But when and where to start? HUM:Why not just continue the dialogue on this subject? ME:Hi,Hum!I am surprised that I will be discussing this subject with you. HUM:What do you mean?We never started or finished it.We have always discussed it! I can see a relationship to theoretical physics already,I thought,chuckling to myself. ME:One of the big questions is something called entanglement,and this has been used as a way to explain certain unexpected experimental responses. HUM:Can you suggest an example that we can work with?

ME:Well,the most popular one here on Earth is the "Double Slit"experiment where a stream of electrons or photons are fired or projected onto a target via a barrier that contains two slits.It demonstrates that a particle would exit one of the slits and create an expected pattern on the target associated with a particle hitting the target.It also demonstrates that a wave would pass through both slits and create another expected pattern associated with a wave.The thing that happens is that the wave can display the same characteristics of a particle,and the particle can display the same characteristics of the wave.There appears to be no difference in how a particle or a wave behaves. HUM:Except that the result is different depending upon who does the experiment,where the experimenter is located,and whether or not the experiment is being observed and/ or recorded in some way. ME:Yes. HUM:Well,in effect,what is being observed is that there is no such thing as one Aspect behaving in the way it is expected to simply because the human mind expects it to operate in that way. ME:What are you suggesting? HUM:What is really being observed is that everything is fluid and that it is one's desire or expectation that creates the condition.In this example the condition is that a particle will behave in one way whereas a wave will behave in another way.It is the expectation and therefore the desire that is creating the response.What is being shown is that once that desire or expectation is removed from an action(experiment)that the result of that action behaves in a way that is more appropriate to the normal function of the multiverse.This means that the physical universe operates in a way that is normal to that which it is part of,or a component of,and not in isolation.In this example,duality is being observed.Spiritualists talk profusely about the whole point of the physical universe being to experience duality,but this is just one aspect of it. ME:Are you saying that the physical universe,even though it is of a low frequency,operates in a way that is multiversal rather than universal? HUM:Correct.Also,that there is more functionality than duality to be observed should the truth seeker open their eyes further. ME:Are you suggesting that there is triality or quadrility,etc.? HUM:Much more than that.There is no end to the level of possibility. ME:So,what is happening in these experiments?Why does the observation of a slit influence the result? HUM:Even though you are in a lower frequency level than you were on Earth a few years ago [Since 2016 we have dropped down the frequencies due to us being spiritually complacent.The effect in 2020,when this book is being channeled,is obvious.-GSN]the effect on those who are questioning the environment that you exist within is still there,but they need a push in the right direction,hence being exposed to certain "physical"anomalies that aren't really anomalies. Think of it in terms of the human race having evolved to a point where it is possible to marry the spiritual,metaphysical,and scientific knowledge together and as a result the boundaries between them are being dissolved to allow this to happen. ME:The results of this experiment are an indicator that nothing is as it seems then?

HUM:Correct.Irrespective of where or what or when this experiment is being performed, the desire for a certain result,and the observation of that experiment,irrespective of how far away the experimenters are,will influence the result. ME:I am getting the impression that even the smallest desire for an experiment will influence the result. HUM:Correct.The whole point of these observations is to show that that which was considered to be solid is actually fluid,that certainty is simply an expression of desire, and that when there is no desire then that which was certain is now both certain and uncertain. ME:I think I understand. HUM:Think of it this way.You and many spiritualists and metaphysicists understand that the local physical universe that is called the Earth is a creation borne from the collective desire to experience physicality and individualized free will,and that you all collectively work within this environment that is collectively created by you all to support this collective desire.This means that this local representation of physicality can only exist while there is collective support for its existence.Its continued existence is supported by the collective benefit of it remaining as such. The experiments and their expression of duality where there should be none,based upon a certain level of scientific understanding,is an illustration of how the locale of this universe(multiverse)can be affected by one's desire or change of desire or expectation. In this instance,the expectation was for a certain result,but that result was outside of the normal operating parameters of the multiverse.Therefore,that which is expected has to operate within the functionality of the structure of the multiverse.If it is within the functionality,then that expectation is met.If it is without the functionality,then the true functionality is observed.In this instance the observation was to see that a particle is also a wave and a wave is also a particle.Additionally,a wave can behave like a particle while continuing to be a wave and a particle can behave like a wave while continuing to be a particle,both the particle and the wave also being able to behave like a particle or wave. ME:Based upon this then,the experimenters'desire to prove the functionality of a particle or wave to be a particle or wave resulted in its true functionality being exposed because labeling it as one or the other is not correct. HUM:Correct. ME:And from a quantum physics perspective or should I say,a physics perspective, everything we had established previously was within the correct functionality of that discovered. HUM:From a high-level perspective,yes.When you drill down into the deeper levels of understanding of quantum physics you will see more multifunctionality. Or...should I say Polyomnifunctionality! ME:What do you mean by Polyomnifunctionality? HUM:Do you remember an article [New Scientist-GSN]you read at your friend's house a few years ago? ME:There are many articles in the New Scientist about teleportation! HUM:I am referring to the recent article about the theory of teleportation where the experimenter uses the ability to move information about the quantum state of a particle using the function of what your scientists call "entanglement"to another particle creating the ability to "copy"the particle in an exact way that gives the appearance of teleportation. For the reader,I am quoting some of the text in the New Scientist article,which states, "Quantum teleportation is a phenomenon in which the quantum states of one particle can be transferred to another,distant particle without anything physical traveling between them.It relies on a property called entanglement,in which measuring the state of one particle immediately affects the state of its entangled partner,regardless of the distance between them."1 ME:Yes,OK,but this relies on one of the entangled particles being in the same location as the particle that was to be teleported. HUM:Very well done and yes.However,note that there is a major limitation. ME:That the particle to be teleported needs to be in the same location as an entangled particle that is paired with the particle that is to receive the information and therefore become that particle. HUM:Correct.This means that to teleport in this way really means to copy information and not transport it. But there is another limitation,and that is the experiment itself.Because what it is really doing is "copying"the information from the one particle and passing it on to the entangled particle that it is located and interacting with,through the intention of the experimenter,with the entangled particle which shares that information with its entangled,and therefore paired,partner. ME:So,this is not really teleportation,it is more like a quantum 3D copying machine,but with a different location for the copy to exist or be manifest in. HUM:Yes.Moreover,there is always a number of copies as a result.There is not a complete exchange of information through entanglement,where the one donor particle loses its information as it is passed on to the paired entangled particle to the other particle.In this example the experiment results in three identical particles,the donor,the entangled particle in the same location as the donor,and the entangled particle in the desired location of teleportation. ME:The experiment is not doing what the experimenters intended to do then? HUM:Wrong,it is doing exactly what the experimenters wanted to do,it's just that their intention was not in the right place,so to speak.Their intention was not focused.Also, the function of the experiment is such that its results are unusable as a means of teleporting large animate or inanimate objects from one location to another. ME:What do you mean their intention was not focused? HUM:Let me explain: 1.The donor particle has the experimenter's intention of being the donor particle and so maintains its status of being the donor particle because of the experimenter's intention. 2.The particle with paired entanglement has the experimenter's intention of being the receiver and sharer of the information with its entangled pair that "is"the donor particle and so maintains its status of being the receiver and sharer of the information that "is"the donor particle by becoming the donor particle from an informational perspective because of the experimenter's intention for it to become the donor particle from an informational perspective while retaining the intention of it being the receiver and sharer of the information. 3.The destination particle with paired entanglement has the experimenter's intention of being the end receiver of the information with its entangled pair that "is"the donor particle.Therefore,it maintains its status of being the end receiver of the information that "is"the donor particle by becoming the donor particle from an informational perspective.This is because of the experimenter's intention for it to become the donor particle from an informational perspective while retaining the intention of it being the end receiver of the information. 4.This creates three particles each with the same information and therefore quantum appearance or signature while having three different levels of intention assigned to them.Therefore,to be donor,receiver/sharer,and end receiver.Any new entanglement with the end receiver or receiver sharer results in new copies of the donor,even if the donor is no longer involved. 5.It's the intention that counts,not the particle's information.

6.Teleporting more than one particle requires the intention not only of receiving,sharing,and receiving the information of one particle but all particles. 7.In the case of teleporting many particles,the particles also need to have the intended function of interaction with the same particles as the donor particles as well and pass that on to the receiver/sharer particles and end receiver particles. Based upon this,in order to teleport an inanimate or animate object in this way, trillions,of trillions,of trillions,of trillions,of trillions of paired entangled particles with multiple intentions and interactions are necessary.Currently,there is not enough processing power in all of the world's computers working together to teleport in this way, even something as small as a golf ball.And this is just for inanimate objects. ME:I suppose true teleportation requires the donor and receiver/sharer particles to relinquish their function and associated information to make it true teleportation.As a result,it's just the end receiving particles that truly become The Original donating particle. HUM:Yes,this would be a copy and delete function which is cumbersome and impractical because unless this is done in a different way,everything is triplicated in the end with the duplicates in the wrong or originating locations needing to be deleted once the process is completed. ME:What's the answer then? HUM:In this instance,it is necessary to move away from the thought process that one needs to create the entanglement to create the possibility of teleportation because every particle in the physical universe,no matter what frequency it is at,is entangled with every other particle. ME:Wait a minute.You're telling me that all particles are entangled with all particles, without exception? HUM:Correct. All That Is Required Is the Desire behind the Intention and Focus on the Intention ME:Let me get this straight.You are suggesting that the methods scientists are using for their teleportation experiments are unworkable? HUM:They are not unworkable,they are just impossible at the current level of computational technology.Even... ME:Even using so-called quantum computers? HUM:Yes. ME:Why,I would have thought that quantum computers would have been powerful enough to be able to work with such huge calculations. HUM:No,they are not capable. ME:Why? HUM:Let me deal with the correct way to teleport an object first and then I will discuss the reasons why the current method won't work with quantum computers.

ME:OK,I am all ears. HUM:Four things need to be understood before the process of teleportation can be a reliable, robust,usable function that incarnate mankind can use. ME:A quick question before you continue. HUM:Yes? ME:Have any other incarnate civilizations developed teleportation technology? HUM:Yes,many. ME:And? HUM:They all understood quantum physics,entanglement,and other functions,which I will go into later,from the spiritual or metaphysical perspective first.They had to know these physical and metaphysical basics before they were able to understand how teleportation works within quantum physics,and therefore,how to change the focus of what the role of the particle/s is,where and will be,recognizing that this is a combined, multifunctional state existing concurrently. ME:This sounds like another chapter to me. HUM:Another section certainly and it is the key to understanding part of the function of the multiverse at this level of frequency. Negating the conundrum of quantum computing,four things need to be considered when creating the desire for teleporting an object from one point to another. 1.Where is the old location? 2.Where is the new location?

3.What is the function of the particles that make up the object? 4.Does the object contain sentience or any function of consciousness down to,and including,minor intelligence? ME:Why is it important to know if the object has intelligence,consciousness,or sentience? HUM:Simply because this can cause resistance to be relocated if there is no agreement for that relocation if the teleportation is being achieved by another influence,such as another entity's intention or some form of technological device. Unfocused sentience (of both the transporter and transported object)can also affect a change in the so-called "sentient transference,"which is normally instantaneous, through being distracted.One could classify this result as"sentient entropy," which is the lack of single focus,or spreading out of (dissolution of),individualized sentience. ME:What does this mean? HUM:It means that the particles that the sentience is initially associated with release the sentience and their functionality,but that sentience and functionality is spread out over a wide area of particles and not those that were desired to be the receivers of the function and sentience. Let me explain the high-level theory and process of teleportation.Please note that teleportation is only really applicable to the physical universe because it is the supposed relocation of physicality-particles-and their functionality or associated sentience.In reality,if a sentient entity decides to relocate,it doesn't relocate the energy(e.g.,particles, etc.)that it associated with,it just relocates its sentience.As a result,there are two forms of teleportation:relocation of sentience,and the relocation of a low-frequency object (particle/s).A third form of teleportation,if you want to call it that,is the relocation of sentience and its associated physicality (commandeered or given-body of energy [particles]). Note though: With the relocation of sentience as a function of its own desire and subsequent intention,from one location within an energetic environment to another,there is no relocation of low-frequency energy (particles)and so this cannot be truly classified as teleportation.This is because it is simply the desire and intention for that sentience to exist in the new location.Sentience,unattached from energy,can move anywhere within the environment/s associated with its evolutionary level at will,without hinderance,by changing its focus,its attention and intention,to being in that new location. Also note that: Quantum teleportation as described by Earth's scientists is not teleportation per se;it is quantum copying [or reassignment of Quantum Function Latency,see below-GSN].The location of The Original and the copy can be anywhere within the physical environment (universe)created by The Source.The number of copies that are capable of being created are limited only by the size of the universe itself.That being,the copies could fill the universe in totality. First,the functions of the universe must be understood before one can create the condition of teleportation.These are: 1.The physical universe is a function of the structure of The Source,and ultimately The Origin.It was isolated by The Source for the use of its smaller units of sentience to experience,learn,and subsequently evolve through interaction with it. 2.Becausethe physical universe isa function ofThe Source/Origin it is not in true isolation,it is in segregation.This means it is subject to the Polyomniscience and Polyomnipresence of The Origin and the omniscience and omnipresence of the individualized sentience that is The Source.It is separately together as one. 3.There is no structural difference in the physical universe.It's all the same.It's all one.This means that everything in the physical universe can be everything else. 4.Everything is totally concurrent.This means that every aspect of the physical universe has the capability of being expressed everywhere concurrently.Or put another way,the functionality of particle "A"is also expressed as the functionality of particle "B,"etc.(if identified as particle "B"),while not being manifest as its function,irrespective of where it is within the universe.The correct term for this is Quantum (Functional)Latency. 5.The manifestation of the expression of the function of particle "A"within particle "B"is the result of the desire and intention of sentience acting its will upon it. 6.Everything is in a constant state of entanglement (concurrency) because everything is everything else concurrently.There is no function that mankind,or any other incarnate civilization,makes that creates entanglement or concurrency because it is always entangled or concurrent 7.It is the collective desire and intention of sentient entities and beings that maintains the individualized particle function thereby keeping it in quantum functional latency with reference to the function of all the other particles in the universe. The process of teleportation is therefore only available in the physical universe as a function of the assignment of a particle from its current function to some part of its quantum functional latency. ME:If what you are saying is that every particle,no matter its size,origin,or function is itself and all other particles at once,concurrently,then there really is no such thing as teleportation.It's just a function of quantum reassignment of one of the myriad aspects of a particle's quantum functional latency. HUM:That's correct.The trick is to do it to all particles that are associated with the object that is to be relocated,so to speak,and know where in the universe it is supposed to be located. ME:How far down in the quanta is affected by quantum functional latency? HUM:Every level. ME:So that's right down to the level of the Anu! HUM:That's correct. ME:No wonder there is a lot of computing to do and that we will never have a computer powerful enough to be able to make the calculations to affect the teleportation of an object from one location to another. HUM:That's correct if you use the current methods of computing.ME:What about the use of quantum computing? HUM:Quantum computing is a distraction right now because it is seen as a panacea for all computing,which it would be if used in the correct way.Especially when considering such big computational tasks because they will also work in the so-called entangled way. Scientists want quantum computing to work in the digital way and that's not what quantum computing is all about.One cannot make something work efficiently and effectively in a way that it is not naturally capable of working in.We can talk about this later.Right now,let's finish the dialogue on teleportation. ME:I am all ears. HUM:As I have explained before,and you have understood,this method of teleportation is just copying and reassigning the object's function from one particle to another by activating the function of The Originating particle,that is currently latent,but available in the target particle,and creating the copy.This is coupled together with scientists thinking that they are actually creating the function of entanglement,when in reality, it is always there for ALL particles at all levels of quanta in the physical universe at all frequency levels,and not just the two or three particles that the scientists are focused upon. ME:So,if we are creating a copy we are not teleporting!

HUM:No,we are,for want of a better description,"bi-locating"the manifestation of one group of particles with another by changing their dominant quantum function to one of their latent quantum functions. ME:I feel we are going in circles here. HUM:It's necessary to make the concept sink in.ME:OK,I understand. I have an idea.What if the functions of the particles are swapped,so that the quantum function of The Originating particle is changed to the quantum function of the target particle?Would that be teleportation? HUM:No,because you are simple swapping the manifest functions around.Think of it as moving a park bench from one park to another and the particles that make the bench in The Original location or first park have their quantum functionality swapped with the "space"that was occupied within the target location or second park.That space may be occupied by a tree,person,or other object.This would mean that in The Originating park a part of a tree,person,or other object would appear in the place of the teleported park bench.The newly relocated park bench would therefore find itself either part of,or very close to,the tree,person,or other object in the park which is the second location. ME:Got it.What fills the gap of what is removed from The Original location then? HUM:Nothing. ME:Nothing? HUM:That being,nothing that would not have been there,had the object that was teleported not been there in the first place.In the instance of the Earth as a location it
